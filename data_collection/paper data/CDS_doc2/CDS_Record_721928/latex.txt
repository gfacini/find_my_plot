###### Abstract

In 200 2 for the first time modules of the ATLAS liquid argon Electromagnetic and Hadronic End-cap Calorimeters (EMEC and HEC) were combined and exposed to beams of electrons, pions and muons in the energy range 6 GeV \(\leq\)_E_\(\leq\) 200 GeV at the CERN SPS. The entire calibration chain is studied from the discrete measured samples of the ionization signals in the EMEC and HEC to the reconstructed energies for electrons, pions and muons. This includes the reconstruction of the ionization signal with the optimal filter technique and the event by event combination of the read-out cells to clusters using a topological neighboring criterion.

The calibration constant between the total ionization signal and the deposited energy for electrons in the EMEC is determined to be \(\alpha_{\rm{EMEC}}^{\rm{EM}}=(0.3855\pm 0.0004)\frac{\rm{MeV}}{\rm{nA}}\) (statistical error only) and the linearity of the response to electrons is observed to be within \(\pm 0.5\%\). The typical intrinsic energy resolution for electrons is found to be \(\frac{\sigma^{\cdot}(E)}{E}=\frac{(12.1\pm 0.2)\%}{\sqrt{E/\rm{GeV}}}\oplus(0.4 \pm 0.1)\%\), which does not include typical electronics noise values between 200 and 300 MeV.

For the energy reconstruction of pions two signal weighting approaches are developed. The intrinsic energy resolution for negative pions is measured to be typically \(\frac{\sigma^{\cdot}(E)}{E}=\frac{(80.7\pm 0.4)\%}{\sqrt{E/\rm{GeV}}}\oplus(0 \pm 0.3)\%\), not including the electronics noise of 1.0 up to 1.6 GeV.

Muon signals are reconstructed with a mean signal to noise ratio of \(4.87\pm 0.10\) and \(4.18\pm 0.07\) in the EMEC and in the HEC, respectively. The relative response of the EMEC and HEC to electrons normalized to the response to muons is determined to be \((\,e/\mu)_{\rm{EMEC}}=0.803\pm 0.003\pm 0.012\) and \((\,e/\mu)_{\rm{HEC}1}=0.98\pm 0.01\pm 0.04\) (statistical and systematic errors, respectively).

All results are compared to detailed Monte Carlo simulations.

## Introduction

Present-day particle physics research represents man's most organized effort to answer the long-standing questions about the structure of matter. At the European Nuclear Physics Laboratory CERN (Conseil Europeenne pour la Recherche Nucleaire) near Geneva, Switzerland a new proton-proton collider, the Large Hadron Collider LHC, is under construction [1]. The center of mass energy of the collisions is designed to be 14 TeV, more than 7 times larger than the present day maximum achievable energy at Fermilab's Tevatron near Chicago. Around the two high luminosity interaction regions of the LHC two multi-purpose experiments, ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus) [2] and CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) [3], are being built.

A major task for these detectors will be the identification, the tracking and the energy measurement of the particles produced in the high energetic collisions. In the ATLAS experiment the kinetic energy of the produced particles (except muons and neutrinos) will be measured by totally absorbing the particles in dense copper, lead and tungsten liquid argon and iron scintillator sampling calorimeters [4, 5].

Beam tests are essential to evaluate the performance of the calorimeter, to determine the needed calibration constants and to develop and optimize reconstruction algorithms for the future operation of the calorimeters in the ATLAS experiment. Previous individual beam tests of the Electromagnetic and Hadronic End-cap Calorimeters (EMEC and HEC, respectively) yielded valuable calibration constants and information about the production quality [6, 7].

In 2002 for the first time modules of the Electromagnetic and Hadronic End-cap Calorimeter were exposed together to particle beams in a setup as close as possible to the future ATLAS setup. The goal of this combined beam test was to obtain calibration constants for electrons, pions and muons and to develop a reconstruction algorithm for single particles in the given beam test setup. The results are compared in detail with the predictions from Monte Carlo simulations to tune the simulations and then to simulate jets in the future ATLAS setup, which are not accessible in beam tests.

In this thesis the whole calibration chain from the read-out of the discrete samples of the ionization signals to the reconstructed energy for the EMEC and the HEC in the 2002 combined beam test at the CERN SPS is studied. The combined performance for electrons, pions and muons is assessed. The energy reconstruction of electrons and pions is based on event by event varying clusters which contain all topologically neighboring signal cells. Special care was taken in the reconstruction of pions, for which two signal weighting approaches are developed to compensate offline for the smaller response of the EMEC and HEC to hadrons compared to electrons.

The thesis is organized in 11 chapters:

1. **The ATL AS Detector**: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the ATLAS experiment together with their scientific motivations and goals are described with a special focus on the design of the Electromagnetic and Hadronic End-cap Calorimeters.
2. **Principles of Calorimetry**: The interactions of particles with matter and electromagnetic and hadronic shower processes are reviewed and the basic principles of calorimetric energy measurements are explained.
3. **Beam Tests**: The beam test setup is described with a special focus on the signal read-out, the calibration of the read-out electronics and the determination of the ionization signal shapes.
4. **Signal Reconstruction**: The ionization signals are reconstructed from the measured signal samples with the optimal filter method. A novel approach for the essential signal timing, based on a global event time, is developed. Necessary timing constants for all channels are determined.
5. **Monte Carlo Simulations**: The simulations of the calorimeter response in the beam test setup in the different simulation frameworks are presented with a special focus on the modeling of hadronic showers.
6. **Offline Reconstruction**: The signal reconstruction in the ATLAS object oriented ATHENA frame-work is outlined. A clustering algorithm is introduced which groups event by event the neighboring read-out cells together.
7. **Alignment and HV Correction**: The real positions of the calorimeter modules with respect to the nominal position are determined from the data and the data are corrected for high voltage problems during the beam test.
8. **Performance for Electrons**: The total ionization signal for electrons is reconstructed in the EMEC and corrected for its dependence on the signal timing and on the reconstructed impact position. Thereafter the electromagnetic scale factor of the EMEC is determined and the uniformity of the EMEC response is surveyed. The energy resolution for electrons together with its energy dependence is evaluated.
9. **Performance for Pions**: The total pion signal is reconstructed in the EMEC and HEC on the electromagnetic scale. To compensate offline for the smaller response of the EMEC and HEC to pions than to electrons two signal weighting approaches are developed and used to reconstruct the deposited energy of the pions. The energy resolution for pions together with its energy dependence is evaluated for both weighting techniques. Moreover the response of the EMEC and HEC to pions is compared in detail to the different MC predictions.
10. **Performance for Muons**: The muon signals are reconstructed in the EMEC and in the HEC and compared to the MC predictions. The signal to noise ratios and the intrinsic \(e/\mu\)-ratios of the EMEC and HEC are determined.
11. **Conclusion and Outlook**: The results are summarized and an outlook to the use of the beam test results in ATLAS is given.

## Chapter 1 The ATLAS Detector at the LHC

The Large Hadron Collider LHC is being built into the existing 27 kilometer long tunnel of the Large Electron Positron Collider LEP at the European Nuclear Research Center CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, see figure 1.1. It will consist of two beam pipes to accelerate and store protons of an energy of 7 TeV. These extremely energetic particles will be forced on a circular trajectory by super-conducting bending magnets which produce a magnetic field of 8.3 T. The LHC will have two high luminosity interaction regions where \(2\times 28\,35\) bunches of high energetic protons will collide head on. These collisions will be recorded and investigated by two large experiments, the ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus) and the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) detector.

The high center of mass energy of the proton proton collisions allows the production of very massive particles, such as top quarks, possibly the Higgs boson or even supersymmetric particles. But compared to the already well known and studied interactions like QCD jet production the expected cross section, the probability for such events to occur, is minute, see figure 1.2. Thus the LHC has to provide the experiments with a very high luminosity. Highly concentrated bunches of protons will meet each other in the interaction region every 25 ns. The design luminosity is \(1.0\cdot 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)[9], a factor of 200 higher than the planned luminosity of the Tevatron [10].

Therefore the experiments have to cope with an expected background rate of approximately 23 inelastic interactions every 25 ns [11]. This requires radiation hard detectors and a very fast read-out of the complex electronics with several million channels without dead time.

### 1.1 Physics Research with the ATLAS Detector

The ATLAS detector is designed to fully exploit and analyze the physics potential of the highest energetic proton proton collisions [11]. The physics program will mainly cover three aspects:

* direct production and first measurements of the Higgs boson, provided its existence
* research into possible extensions of the standard model of particle physics* precision measurements of standard model parameters

Because of the high center of mass energy the production cross section for the recently discovered top quark will allow one to collect samples of about \(10^{7}\) top events, which will lead to a more precise determination of the top quark mass and its couplings. There will also be huge samples of bottom hadrons. Together with an efficient b-tagging via its secondary vertices this will allow one to further exploit the mixing and CP violation parameters in the B-system, especially with strange and charmed B-mesons, which are not producible by the B-factories on the \(\Upsilon(4s)\) resonance. The hadron collisions at a new energy scale are of course a perfect test bed for studies of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), for example jet production and determination of the strong coupling constant.

The Higgs boson [12] is the last particle which was predicted by the standard model and still has not been found. It plays a crucial role in the breaking of the electroweak symmetry and in the mass generation [13, 14, 15]. There were extensive efforts made at former experiments, most recently at the LEP collider and at the Tevatron to find this particle, which resulted in constraints on its mass [16]. The ATLAS experiment will have the potential either to find the Higgs boson or to falsify the standard model [11].

Possible extensions of the standard model of particle physics are for instance Supersymmetry [17], Grand Unified Theories [18] and Extra Dimensions [19]. Out of these, Supersymmetry seems to be the theoretically most appealing model. For large parts of the possible parameter space of Supersymmetry the ATLAS detector will have the capability to discover or exclude new supersymmetric particles.

Figure 1.1: Schematic view of the chain of accelerators and the experiments at CERN [8].

The ATLAS calorimeters serve three main objectives [20]:

* electron / gamma reconstruction
* jet reconstruction
* reconstruction of the (missing) transverse energy.

A very prominent use of the accurate reconstruction of electrons and gamma quanta are possible decays of the Higgs boson \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to e^{+}e^{-}e^{+}e^{-}\).

A good jet reconstruction is of importance for the mass measurement of the top quark, various QCD studies and the search for hadronic decays of possible new particles.

Because protons are not fundamental particles the hard scattering in a proton proton collision takes place between two constituents of the protons. Thus the actual center of mass energy of the subprocess is not equal to the one based on the beam energy. Because the energy of the proton remnants that escape detection in the beam pipe in the forward direction cannot be measured, mainly the energy corresponding to the transverse motion of the particles is of interest in hadron collisions. Due to momentum conservation, the overall transverse momentum has to be zero. As there are particles like neutrinos or possibly supersymmetric particles that escape undetected their existence can only be deduced from the missing transverse energy.

Figure 1.2: Comparison of the cross sections for various physics processes at the Tevatron and the LHC [11].

The ATLAS Detector at the LHC

The calorimeters play a crucial role in the physics program of the ATLAS detector. To reach the physics goals the best possible calibration of the calorimeters for electrons, gamma quanta and jets is necessary.

### 1.2 Design of the ATLAS Detector

ATLAS is designed to be a universal detector for all interesting physics processes in hadron collisions at the LHC. It is designed to optimally analyze all those reactions and thus answer a wide variety of physics questions.

In sum more than 150 institutes from 30 different countries are participating in the ATLAS experiment. Amongst these institutes are the Max-Planck-Institute for Physics in Munich and eight other universities in Germany [21]. The first period of data taking is planned for the year 2007 and it is expected for the LHC and the ATLAS detector to produce most interesting data at the frontier of science for at least 10 years.

Figure 1.3 shows a schematic view of the ATLAS detector. It has a height of about 22 m, a length of 46 m and is dominated by a huge muon spectrometer [11]. Like an onion the ATLAS detector is composed of different shell layers of sub-detectors which serve a special purpose each.

The 'inner detector' provides tracking information of charged particles produced in hadron collisions and some information to distinguish between different particle species. It has a

Figure 1.3: The overall layout of the ATLAS detector [11].

length of 7 m, a diameter of 2.3 m and consists of a Semiconductor Tracker (SCT) which employs silicon pixel and strip detectors for particle tracking. A Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) for particle identification and further tracking information [22] is located around the SCT.

Around the inner detector three big cryostats are located, a central barrel which contains a 2 Tesla solenoid magnet and the electromagnetic barrel liquid argon calorimeter. There are two end-caps which each contain an electromagnetic, hadronic and forward liquid argon calorimeter and an end-cap toroid, as shown in figure 1.4. In the central region outside of the cryostat an iron scintillator calorimeter will be installed [5]. The ATLAS Liquid Argon calorimeters will be discussed in more detail in section 1.2.2.

The outermost detector component is a huge muon spectrometer. It is designed to measure the momentum and the direction of muons independently of all other detectors [23]. Eight giant super-conducting toroids will produce a magnetic field of up to 3.5 T in which the trajectory of the muons will be bent and measured by monitored drift tubes, resistive plate chambers and cathode strip chambers.

#### Coordinate System

The ATLAS coordinate system is based on a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system with the axes x,y and z, where the x-axis points towards the center of the LHC ring, the y-axis points upwards and the z-axis coincides with the beam axis.

To exploit the symmetry of the detector, the ATLAS experiment uses a spherical coordinate system, which is defined in terms of the z-axis, the polar angle \(\theta\) and the azimuthal angle \(\phi\), measured from the direction towards the center of the LHC ring. The polar angular coordinate \(\theta\) is most often expressed in terms of the so called pseudo-rapidity \(\eta\), defined as:

\[\eta=-\ln\left(\tan\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\,. \tag{1.1}\]

For massless particles the pseudo-rapidity is the rapidity \(y\) in z-direction \(y=\mathrm{atanh}(v_{z}/c)\). Unlike velocities, rapidities do add linearly under Lorenz boost transformations. This makes the (pseudo)rapidity particularly useful in measurements of longitudinally boosted systems such as the hard scattering of partons in proton proton interactions. Moreover, the distribution of charged particles in the bulk of proton proton collisions is approximately flat in (pseudo)rapidity. This is why most detector parts of ATLAS are segmented in equal pseudo-rapidity intervals.

#### The ATLAS Calorimeters

As discussed above the calorimeters play a very important role in the ATLAS experiment. An overview of the ATLAS calorimeters is given in figure 1.4. The electromagnetic calorimeter consists of a barrel part in the pseudo rapidity range \(|\eta|\lesssim 1.4\) and two End-caps in the region \(1.375<|\eta|<3.2\). It is made of accordion shaped absorbers and uses

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]

Each wheel is divided into eight wedge-shaped modules. In the region \(1.5<|\eta|<2.5\) the detector is segmented into three longitudinal sections, in figure 1.6 a barrel module of similar segmentation is shown. The first section is made of narrow strips to give an excellent \(\eta\) position resolution and has a depth of about four radiation lengths \(X_{0}\), for a definition see section 2.1.1. In the region \(1.375<|\eta|<1.5\) the detector is only segmented into two longitudinal sections. The segmentation of the EMEC in the region of the beam test is summarized in table 1.1. All segment and read-out boundaries of the EMEC are projective, they will point to the assumed interaction point in the ATLAS setup.

Figure 1.6: The granularity of a EM barrel module [4]. The calorimeter consists of three longitudinal layers. The first layer consists of narrow strips to give an excellent position resolution in \(\eta\).

Figure 1.5: Schematic view of an EMEC module. Only three accordion shaped absorbers out of 96 (in the outer wheel) are represented [4].

In the region \(1.5<|\eta|<1.8\) a presampler device is installed in front of the EMEC. It essentially consists of a 5 mm active liquid argon layer which is read-out with a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.025\times 0.2\). The purpose of the presampler in ATLAS is to correct for the energy deposits in the material in front of the calorimeters. In case the shower has already started in front of the calorimeters, the presampler signal is proportional to the number of shower particles, which measures the upstream energy deposit.

#### Hadronic End-Cap Calorimeter

The Hadronic End-cap Calorimeter (HEC) is a liquid argon sampling calorimeter with flat copper absorber plates. It consists of two wheels, the front HEC1 and the rear HEC2 wheel, and is located in the end-cap cryostat behind the Electromagnetic End-cap Calorimeter. The HEC1 and HEC2 wheels are made out of 32 pie-shaped modules each. HEC1 consists of 24 25.0 mm thick Cu absorber plates and one 12.5 mm thick front plate. HEC2 consists of 16 50.0 mm thick Cu absorber plates and one 25.0 mm thick front plate [4]. The absorber material of the HEC amounts to about 11 hadronic interaction lengths \(\lambda_{I}\) (for a definition see section 2.1.3), whereas the EMEC has a depth of about \(1.5\lambda_{I}\). In total 24 gaps in HEC1 and 16 gaps in HEC2 are equipped with a read-out structure. These gaps are grouped together and read-out in 4 longitudinal layers of 8, 16 (HEC1), 8 and 8 gaps (HEC2). The read-out structures are pseudo pointing in \(\eta\), see figure 1.7.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c} \(\eta\) range & Front & Middle & Back \\ \hline \([1.425,1.5]\) & \(0.025\times 0.1\times 22\) & \(0.025\times 0.025\times 4\) & \(-\) \\ \([1.5,1.8]\) & \(\sim 0.003\times 0.1\times 4\) & \(0.025\times 0.025\times 18\) & \(0.025\times 0.050\times 4\) \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure 1.7: The pseudo pointing HEC geometry and read-out structure, after [4]. In the beam tests only the first half of the HEC2 modules was used. The vertical red lines show the longitudinal read-out layers. Layers 2 to 4 consist of two staged sublayers.

Each liquid argon gap is divided into four sub-gaps with own ground and high voltage connections each, see figure 1.8. This reduces the required high voltage and serves as a security measure. In case of a high voltage problem, only 1/4 of the gap has to be cut of.

Figure 1.8: Cross section of one HEC read-out gap [4]. The readout gap consists of four sub-gaps with own high voltage lines.

## Chapter 2 Principles of Calorimetry

This chapter will briefly summarize the general principles of calorimetry and of physical processes exploited by the technique. First the interactions of high energy particles with matter and shower processes are reviewed and thereafter calorimetric measurements are described.

### 2.1 Interactions of Particles with Matter

To describe the interaction of particles with matter, one considers interactions via the strong and the electromagnetic force. The weak force is much too small to contribute, it only has to be considered to detect neutrinos which do not take part in the other interactions.

#### Electromagnetic Interactions of Charged Particles with Matter

There are five processes of electromagnetic interactions of charged particles with matter:

* Ionization
* Bremsstrahlung
* Excitation
* Transition radiation
* Cherenkov radiation.

For the signal production in the ATLAS liquid argon calorimeters ionization and bremsstrahlung are of special importance and described below. Excitation is used in scintillator calorimeters, like the ATLAS tile calorimeter, and Cherenkov radiation is employed for example in lead glass calorimeters. The process of transition radiation is not commonly applied in calorimetric measurements.

The energy loss of a charged particle through **ionization** of the absorber material is described by the _Bethe-Bloch equation_[16]:

\[-\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}x}\simeq 4\pi r_{\mathrm{e}}^{2}m_{\mathrm{e}}c^{ 2}N_{A}z^{2}\,\rho\frac{Z}{A}\frac{1}{\beta^{2}}\left[\frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{2m_{ \mathrm{e}}c^{2}\beta^{2}T_{\mathrm{max}}}{I^{2}(1-\beta^{2})}-\beta^{2}- \frac{\delta}{2}\right]. \tag{2.1}\]

\(E\)Particle energy

\(x\)distance travelled in absorber

\(r_{\mathrm{e}}\)Classical electron radius \(r_{\mathrm{e}}=\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}m_{\mathrm{e}}c^{2}}\)

\(m_{\mathrm{e}}\)Electron mass

\(N_{A}\)Avogadro's number

\(z\)Charge of the incoming particle

\(\rho\)mass density of the absorber material

\(Z\)Charge of the nucleus of the absorber material

\(A\)Relative atomic mass of the absorber material

\(\beta\)Fraction of the velocity of the particle of the speed of light

\(I\)Effective ionisation potential of the absorber material (\(\simeq 12\) eV \(\cdot Z\))

\(T_{\mathrm{max}}\)maximum kinetic energy, which can be transferred to a free electron

in a single collision

\(\delta\)density effect correction to the ionization energy loss.

The energy loss of charged particles due to **bremsstrahlung** for high energies can be described by [24]:

\[-\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}x}=4\,\alpha N_{A}\rho\frac{Z^{2}}{A}z^{2}r_{ \mathrm{e}}^{2}\left(\frac{m_{\mathrm{e}}}{m}\right)^{2}E\ln\frac{183}{Z^{1/3} }\, \tag{2.2}\]

where \(\alpha\) is the fine-structure constant and \(m\) is the particle mass. Because of the small electron mass bremsstrahlung plays a very important role for the energy loss of electrons. For electrons it is usually written as:

\[-\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}x}=\frac{E}{X_{0}}\quad\mathrm{with}\quad X_{0} ^{-1}=4\alpha N_{A}\rho\frac{Z^{2}}{A}r_{\mathrm{e}}^{2}\ln\frac{183}{Z^{1/3} }\, \tag{2.3}\]

where \(X_{0}\) is the radiation length of an absorber. After having traveled a distance \(X_{0}\) in matter an electron has lost on average all but \(1/e\) of its initial energy. For particles other than electrons bremsstrahlung energy losses play a minor role up to energies of about 1 TeV.

In figure 2.1 the energy loss of positive muons in copper due to the different mechanisms is plotted as a function of the initial energy. For energies from a few MeV up to 1 TeV the muon energy loss is dominated by ionization. For higher energies bremsstrahlung losses set in.

The energy for which both ionization and bremsstrahlung contribute the same fraction to the energy loss is called the critical energy \(E_{\rm c}\). Due to the small electron mass the critical energy for electrons is especially small and can be approximated for absorbers with a nuclear charge greater than 13 to be [24]:

\[E_{\rm c}\simeq\frac{550\,{\rm MeV}}{Z}. \tag{2.4}\]

#### Interactions of Photons with Matter

To describe the interaction of photons with matter three effects have to be considered:

* Photo effect
* Compton effect
* Electron positron pair production.

The intensity \(I\) of a photon beam as a function of the way traveled in the material obeys a decay law:

\[I(x)=I_{0}\,e^{-\mu\rho x}\, \tag{2.5}\]

with \(I_{0}\) being the initial intensity, \(\mu\) the mass absorption coefficient, \(\rho\) the mass density and \(x\) the thickness of the absorber. The mass absorption coefficient can be approximated to be [25]:

Figure 2.1: Energy loss of positive muons in copper as a function of the muon energy [16]. For energies from a few MeV up to 1 TeV the muon energy loss is dominated by ionization and described by the Bethe-Bloch equation. For higher energies bremsstrahlung energy losses set in.

\[\mu\rho\simeq\frac{7}{9X_{0}}\, \tag{2.6}\]

where \(X_{0}\) is the previously defined radiation length. Thus in an absorber of one radiation length thickness a high energy photon converts into an electron positron pair with a probability of \(1-e^{-\frac{5}{9}}\simeq 54\,\%\).

In figure 2.2 the interaction probabilities of photons in lead for the photo effect, Compton scattering and pair production are shown as functions of the initial energy of the photon.

For photon energies larger than a few MeV the pair production dominates over the other processes. Thereby the photon converts into an electron positron pair in the electric field of a nucleus of the absorber material, which receives the recoil momentum. At lower photon energies the photon is likely to scatter off the quasi-free atomic electrons of the absorber, known as Compton scattering. In the photo electric effect the photon is completely absorbed by an atomic electron, which is the main process for photon energies below a few keV.

#### Strong Interactions of Hadrons with Matter

There is a very large number of processes in which hadrons can interact with the nuclei of matter. More than 300 processes contribute more than 0.1% each to the total cross section of the interactions [26]. In principle all these processes are described by QCD, the theory of strong interactions, but up to now the theoretical modeling of these processes is still under development.

Apart from a thorough calculation phenomenological models for the hadron nucleus reaction can be used, for example spallation [26]. In this process all kinds of hadrons and nuclear fragments are produced, but mostly pions and nucleons. The average multiplicity \(\langle n\rangle\), the number of produced particles, shows a weak energy dependence [27] :

Figure 2.2: Interaction probabilities of photons for the photo effect, Compton scattering and pair production are shown as functions of the initial energy of the photon [24]. For photon energies larger than a few MeV the pair production dominates over the other processes.

\[\langle n\rangle\approx A^{0.1}\cdot\ln\left(\frac{s}{\mathrm{GeV}^{2}}\right)\,, \tag{2.7}\]

where \(\sqrt{s}\) is the center of mass energy of the hadron nucleus collision.

Above the nuclear resonances the cross section for hadron nucleus collisions shows only a weak energy dependence. The probability \(p(x)\) that a high energy hadron travels a distance \(x\) in the absorber _without_ interacting with one of the absorber nuclei is given by:

\[p(x)=\exp\left(-\frac{x}{\lambda_{l}}\right)\,, \tag{2.8}\]

where \(\lambda_{l}\) is the nuclear interaction length. It can roughly be estimated for proton nucleon interactions to be [16]:

\[\lambda_{l}\,\simeq 35\frac{A^{1/3}}{\rho}\frac{\mathrm{g}}{\mathrm{cm}^{2}}\,, \tag{2.9}\]

where \(\rho\) is the density of the absorber.

### 2.2 Development of Shower Cascades

When high energy particles interact with matter, new secondary particles are produced which share the energy of the incoming particle. The secondary particles interact again with the absorber material and produce tertiary particles and so on. Thus the primary energy is shared amongst a growing number of particles. This mechanism continues until the energy of the particles is not sufficient to produce new ones. The whole mechanism from the first interaction of the incoming particle till the stopping of the last particle is called a shower cascade.

According to their origin, one distinguishes between electromagnetic (initiated by electrons and photons) and hadronic (initiated by hadrons) showers.

Some material constants that are of importance for the calorimeters in the ATLAS experiments are given in table 2.1.

#### Electromagnetic Showers

Electromagnetic showers develop through the electromagnetic processes of bremsstrahlung and pair production. High energy electrons and positrons radiate a bremsstrahlung photon in the electric field of a nucleus of the absorber material which then converts into a new electron positron pair and so on until the shower dies out, when * the energy of the electrons and positrons falls below the critical energy such that they loose more energy by ionization then by bremsstrahlung and
* the photons are below the energy threshold for pair production.

In figure 2.3 a schematic picture of an electromagnetic shower is shown. The size of electromagnetic showers is determined by the radiation length of the absorber material, which is inversely proportional to the square of the atomic charge of the absorber. 98% of the energy of the incident particle is contained in a length of [24]:

\[L(98\%)=2.5X_{0}\,\left[\ln\left(\frac{E}{E_{\rm c}}\right)+C\right]\, \tag{2.10}\]

where \(E\) is the energy of the incoming particle, \(E_{\rm c}\) is the critical energy of the absorber material and \(C=+0.5\) for photons respectively \(C=-0.5\) for electrons and positrons.

Figure 2.3: Schematic picture of an electromagnetic cascade [24]. Straight lines represent electrons and positrons, while curly lines represent photons.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c c c c c} Material & \(Z\) & \(A\) & \(\rho\,\left[\frac{\rm g}{\rm cm^{3}}\right]\) & \(X_{0}\,\left[\rm cm\right]\) & \(\lambda_{I}\,\left[\rm cm\right]\) & \(\left[\frac{\rm d}{\rm d}\,\chi\right]_{\rm m\,in}\left[\frac{\rm MeV}{\rm cm}\right]\) \\ \hline Fe & 26 & 55.85 & 7,87 & 1.76 & 16.76 & 11.42 \\ Pb & 82 & 207.19 & 11.35 & 0.56 & 17.09 & 12.74 \\ Cu & 29 & 63.55 & 8.96 & 1.43 & 15.06 & 12.57 \\ LAr & 18 & 39.95 & 1.40 & 14.0 & 83.95 & 2.120 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2.1: Some material constants of importance for the ATLAS calorimeters as in [16]. \(\left(\frac{\rm d}{\rm d}\,\chi\right)_{\rm m\,in}\) denotes the energy loss per distance of a minimum ionizing particle, see figure 2.1.

The transverse extension of an electromagnetic shower is often described in terms of the Moliere-Radius \(R_{\rm M}\)[16]:

\[R_{\rm M}=\frac{m_{\rm e}c^{2}\sqrt{\frac{4\,\pi}{\alpha}}}{E_{\rm c}}X_{0}\, \simeq\,21.2{\rm MeV}\,\cdot\frac{X_{0}}{E_{\rm c}}\, \tag{2.11}\]

where \(X_{0}\) is the radiation length of the absorber medium. In homogeneous calorimeters 95% of the energy of the shower is deposited in a cylinder of radius \(2R_{\rm M}\) around the axis of the shower [24].

In general, the higher the atomic number of the absorber, the smaller the spatial extension of the shower becomes. This is why lead is often chosen as an absorber for electrons and photons.

#### Hadronic Showers

The basis of a hadronic shower is that the incoming hadron interacts via the strong force with a nucleus of the absorber material. In this reaction new hadrons are produced, which themselves scatter inelastically off atomic nuclei and thus further produce hadrons and so on until the energy of the hadrons is below the production threshold for new hadrons. But next to this purely hadronic process one also has to consider three other processes:

* Electromagnetic decays, especially of \(\pi^{0}\)s
* Weak decays of hadrons
* Ionization of the calorimeter material.

In figure 2.4 the development of a hadronic shower is shown. Of major concern for the hadron calorimetry is the production of \(\pi^{0}\)s, which decay after a mean life time of about \(10^{-16}\) seconds into two photons which then initiate an electromagnetic sub-shower. As roughly 1/3 of the produced pions in each hadronic interaction are \(\pi^{0}\)s a substantial amount of the initial energy of the incoming hadron can be deposited in electromagnetic sub-showers. Moreover, the relative amount of the electromagnetic sub-showers of the whole hadronic shower is subject to large fluctuations.

Because of the small range of the strong force and the tiny dimensions of hadrons and nuclei (of the order of a few Fermi, \(10^{-15}\)m, compared to the diameter of atoms of some Angstroms, \(10^{-10}\)m) the cross section for an interaction of the incident hadron with the nuclei of the absorber material is fairly small. This is why the spatial extension of a hadronic shower is much larger than the one of an electromagnetic shower. The shower size is characterized by the hadronic interaction length \(\lambda_{\rm f}\), which is defined in analogy to the electromagnetic radiation length \(X_{0}\). According to table 2.1 the hadronic interaction length exceeds the radiation length by factors of 6 (LAr), 10 (Cu and Fe) up to 30 (Pb). So the size of a hadronic shower is about one order of magnitude larger than the size of an electromagnetic shower.

The absorber thickness in which 95% of the initial hadron energy is deposited, \(\lambda_{95}\), can be parametrized [25]:

\[\lambda_{95}\simeq[9.4\ln(E/\mathrm{GeV})+\,39]\mathrm{cm}\cdot\frac{\lambda_{l} }{\lambda_{l}(\mathrm{Fe})}\;. \tag{2.12}\]

### 2.3 Calorimetric Measurements

In high energy physics calorimeters are used to measure the energy of a particle by totally absorbing its energy. Moreover, segmented calorimeters also allow a position determination by comparing the energy deposits in the different segments.

In general the energy of all stable particles can be measured with calorimeters except for muons and neutrinos. Muons of energies up to 1 TeV are very unlikely to produce bremsstrahlung photons due to their large mass and thus only lose energy through ionization. Neutrinos interact only via the weak force.

Inside the calorimeter the measured particle interacts and looses its whole energy in a shower process. The shower is detected and read out by means of ionization, Cherenkov radiation or scintillation light. Depending on whether the whole calorimeter or only part of it is read out, calorimeters can be divided into homogeneous and sampling calorimeters.

The main features of calorimetric energy measurements are:

Figure 2.4: Schematic picture of a hadronic cascade [24]. The full lines represent charged particles that contribute to the calorimeter signal, whereas the broken lines represent neutral particles that do not contribute to the signal. Also electromagnetic sub-showers due to decays of neutral pions into two photons are shown.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:28]

to be constant the energy of the particle which initiates the shower is proportional to the total integrated path length of all shower particles.

As read-out quantities ionization, scintillation light from excitation and Cherenkov light are frequently used. The deposited energy, \(E_{\mathrm{depo}}\), is proportional to the observed signal:

\[E_{\mathrm{depo}}=\alpha\cdot\mathrm{Signal}. \tag{2.13}\]

The proportionality constant \(\alpha\) has to be determined in beam test experiments. Thereby the calorimeter is exposed to particle beams of known species and energy. The calibration constant \(\alpha\) is than given by the average ratio between the deposited energy in the calorimeter and the reconstructed signal.

#### Invisible Energy in Hadronic Showers

In general, only part of the initial energy of hadrons, \(E_{\mathrm{beam}}\), is deposited inside a calorimeter, \(E_{\mathrm{depo}}\), due to the following reasons:

* Hadronic cascades are often too large to be fully contained in the calorimeter.
* Muons and neutrinos are produced in weak hadron decays and leave the calorimeter.

The energy deposit beyond the calorimeter, is known as leakage energy, \(E_{\mathrm{leak}}\):

\[E_{\mathrm{beam}}=E_{\mathrm{depo}}+E_{\mathrm{leak}}. \tag{2.14}\]

Moreover only part of the deposited energy in a hadronic shower can be detected in a calorimeter:

* Neutral hadrons, especially neutrons, are produced, which do not contribute to the ionization signal.
* Energy is lost to break nuclear bindings.
* Nuclear fragments are stopped in the insensitive absorber of a sampling calorimeter and do not contribute to the signal.

This is why the ratio of the observed signal to the deposited energy often differs for electromagnetic and hadronic showers. Thus one cannot use the proportionality constant \(\alpha^{\mathrm{EM}}\) between the deposited energy and the observed signal for electrons/photons to reconstruct the energy for hadrons:

\[E_{\mathrm{depo}}(\mathrm{hadron})\neq E^{\mathrm{EM\ scale}}(\mathrm{hadron})= \alpha^{\mathrm{EM}}\cdot\mathrm{Signal}(\mathrm{hadron}). \tag{2.15}\]The ratio between \(E^{\text{EM scale}}\)(hadron), the reconstructed energy on the electromagnetic scale, and the deposited energy is often smaller than one. Such a calorimeter is called to be _under-compensating_.

To be able to measure the energy of electrons and hadrons with the same calorimeter, one has to make it either intrinsically compensating (for example by using Uranium-238 as an absorber to boost the hadron signal through the gain of binding energy in fission) or to identify the nature of the observed shower offline and thus to account for the invisible energy of hadronic showers. This is done by so called signal weighting techniques, as discussed in section 2.4.3.

#### Energy Resolution for Sampling Calorimeters

The energy resolution \(\frac{\Delta E}{E}\) of sampling calorimeters is often parameterized as follows:

\[\frac{\Delta E}{E}=\frac{a}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus b\oplus\frac{c}{E}\, \tag{2.16}\]

where \(\oplus\) means the addition in quadrature. There are three contributions to the energy resolution:

The first term, \(\frac{a}{\sqrt{E}}\), is proportional to the inverse square root of the particle energy and is called the _sampling term_. The deposited energy in the active medium is proportional to the number \(N\) of the produced secondary particles in the shower. The statistical error in this number, \(\Delta N\), can be assumed to be its square root. So the statistical error in the deposited energy is given by:

\[\left(\frac{\Delta E}{E}\right)_{\text{sampling}}\sim\frac{\Delta N}{N}=\frac{ 1}{\sqrt{N}}\sim\frac{1}{\sqrt{E}} \tag{2.17}\]

The parameter \(a\) is determined by the properties of the absorber and the active medium, especially by their thickness.

The second term that contributes to the calorimeter resolution, \(b\), is a constant that is determined by losses, inhomogeneities and the read-out system. For hadronic showers in non-compensating calorimeters the constant term has a major contribution due to the different response to electromagnetic and purely hadronic parts of the shower [28].

The last term, \(\frac{c}{E}\), is due to noise, mostly in the electronics. The absolute noise for a fixed number of read-out channels should be independent of the signal and thus the relative noise contribution decreases proportional to the signal height.

#### Weighting Techniques for the Hadron Energy Reconstruction

The aim of all weighting techniques is to compensate offline for the different response of the calorimeter for electrons and hadrons due to the "lost" invisible energy, see section 2.4.1.

Thereby the calorimeter response on the electromagnetic scale, \(E^{\rm EM\ scale}=\alpha^{\rm EM}\)Signal, is multiplied event by event by an appropriate factor \(w\) to reconstruct the true deposited energy, \(E^{\rm depo}\), see references [29, 30, 31]:

\[E_{\rm depo}\,=w\cdot E^{\rm EM\ scale}. \tag{2.18}\]

The basis of all weighting approaches is to infer the electromagnetic content of the whole shower. Typically one makes use of the fact that the radiation length \(X_{0}\) and the hadronic interaction length \(\lambda_{I}\) differ by about one order of magnitude (see table 2.1), which means that electromagnetic showers are much denser than purely hadronic ones. Thus the weight is a function of the energy density, \(\frac{E^{\rm EM\ scale}}{V}\), and of the total deposited energy:

\[E_{\rm depo}\,=w\left(E_{\rm depo}\,,\frac{E^{\rm EM\ scale}}{V}\right)\cdot E ^{\rm EM\ scale}\, \tag{2.19}\]

where \(V\) is the calorimeter volume, in which \(E^{\rm EM\ scale}\) is measured. The weights should satisfy the following requirements [27]:

1. The mean reconstructed energy should be equal to the true deposited energy.
2. The width of the distribution of the reconstructed energy for a given deposited energy should be minimal.
3. The distribution of the reconstructed energy for a given deposited energy should be symmetric around its mean.

Using the weighting technique the constant term \(b\) in the resolution is substantially reduced.

## Chapter 3 Beam Tests

In this section the beam test setup, the particle beams used, the trigger system, the read-out and calibration, and the data taken are described.

### 3.1 Beam Test Setup

During the 2002 combined beam test 1/8 of a full E MEC wheel together with a presampler device were placed in front of 3 out of 32 HE C1 modules and 2 out of 32 HE C2 half-modules in a cryostat of 2.5 m diameter at the H6 beamline at the CERN SPS, see figure 3.1. The cryostat was filled with liquid argon and maintained at \((89.9\pm 0.1)\) K. The restriction to only two HE C2 modules of half of the normal depth was due to space constraints within the cryostat. The two HEC2 modules were rotated by 1/2 module in \(\phi\) with respect to

Figure 3.1: Top view of the EMEC module with the presampler, the three HE C1 modules and the two HE C2 modules of reduced longitudinal size in the cryostat.

## Chapter 3 Beam Tests

HEC1. Furthermore, the modules were not positioned in a pointing direction. Instead, the beams entered the calorimeters parallel to the z-axis in the ATLAS coordinate system, which resulted in showers depositing energy in a larger number of cells in \(\eta\) than in ATLAS.

The beam test geometry is described in terms of a Cartesian coordinate system with the axes x,y and z, where the x-axis is horizontal, the y-axis points vertically upwards and the z-axis coincides with the opposite direction of the undeflected beam. The nominal position of the calorimeter modules, \((x_{\mathrm{nom}}\,,\ y_{\mathrm{nom}}\,,\ z_{\mathrm{nom}})\), is such that:

\[x_{\mathrm{nom}}=x_{\mathrm{ATLAS}}\qquad y_{\mathrm{nom}}=y_{\mathrm{ATLAS} }+172\ \mathrm{cm}\qquad z_{\mathrm{nom}}=z_{\mathrm{ATLAS}}+277\ \mathrm{cm}\, \tag{3.1}\]

where \(x_{\mathrm{ATLAS}}\), \(y_{\mathrm{ATLAS}}\) and \(z_{\mathrm{ATLAS}}<0\) would be the calorimeter coordinates in the ATLAS coordinate system, see section 1.2.1.

Figure 3.2 shows the schematics of the beam test setup. Several sub-detectors, such as scintillation counters and multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPCs), were installed in the beamline to provide a trigger signal, see section 3.3, and to track the beam particles.

To study different impact points of the beam particles on the calorimeter modules the cryostat was mounted on rails, so it could be moved horizontally by \(\pm 30\) cm. Vertically the beam could be deflected by a bending magnet by about \(\pm 25\) cm on the front face of the EMEC. The exact impact point could be determined with the help of four multi-wire proportional chambers. Each chamber has planes of horizontal and vertical wires of 1 mm spacing (2 mm for MWPC 5).

To reduce the dead material in front of the calorimeters the cryostat had a circular beam entrance window of 60 cm diameter with a reduced wall thickness and the liquid argon in front of the calorimeters was excluded by a low density foam excluder. The effect of dead material in front of the calorimeters was studied by placing a variable number of absorber plates in front of the cryostat for some runs.

### 3.2 Beam

The H 6 beam line in the EHN 1 experimental area provides secondary and tertiary electron, pion and muon beams of energies up to 200 GeV [32].

Figure 3.2: Schematics of the beam test setup: W1, W2, B1, B2, HOLE, F1, F2, VM, M1 and M2 are scintillation counters to derive the trigger signal. The multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPCs) measure the particle track.

## Chapter 3 Beam Tests

In the CERN SPS (Super-Proton-Synchrotron), see figure 1.1, 450 GeV proton beams are produced and directed on a common production target for the secondary beams of the H6 and H8 beamline. Electrons are separated from pions by their synchrotron radiation energy loss in a bending magnet.

To produce low energy particle beams in the range up to 80 GeV a second target is introduced in the H6 beam line. For these energies the information of a differential Cherenkov counter (CEDAR) can be used to separate electrons from pions.

The beam momentum spread of the H6 beam is typically \(\delta p/p=0.3\%\), depending on the setting of the collimators, and thus negligible compared to the resolution of the calorimeter.

### 3.3 Trigger System

The read-out of the detector was triggered with the help of several trigger and veto counters which were installed in the beam line before and after the cryostat, see figure 3.2.

The pre-trigger was formed by a coincident signal in the B1, F1 and F2 fast scintillation detectors upstream of the cryostat.

F1 and F2 were 2.5 cm wide fast scintillator bars with a time resolution of 70 ps. They were oriented perpendicular to one another and thus effectively defined the transverse size of the beam. Both were mounted on a motorized table which could be displaced in the vertical direction.

VM and HOLE were both scintillating counters used to veto events in which particles from the beam halo arrived at the same time as the pre-trigger signal. Moreover, events were not recorded whenever they occurred too closely in time, which would have created an overlap of the signals in the detector, the so called early or late pile-up.

The trigger for muons required in addition a signal in the planar arrays of scintillation detectors M1 and M2 behind the cryostat and an additional iron wall, respectively.

### 3.4 Signal Read-out

The ionization signals produced in the liquid argon gaps of every HEC read-out channel were amplified and summed by cold pre- and summing amplifiers and carried to the front-end-boards (FEBs) outside the cryostat. There the signals were shaped by a \(RC^{2}-CR\) shaper. A more detailed description of the front-end electronics can be found in [33].

Every 25 ns a discrete time sample of the ionization signal is stored in an analog memory, a Switched Capacitor Array (SCA), with a sampling jitter of less than 45 ps, for further specifications see reference [34]. When the trigger signal arrives, predefined samples from the SCA are digitized by a flash ADC and the data is transmitted to the Read Out Drivers (ROD) through serial links. The EMEC signals were processed in the same way except that the signals were not amplified in the liquid argon but on the EMEC FEB [6].

Each trigger led to the recording of 7 discrete time samples of the EMEC signal pulse and 16 samples of the HEC signal together with the trigger and MWPC information. Incontrast to the future ATLAS setup, the trigger in the beam test is asynchronous with respect to the signal sampling every 25 ns, initiated by an independent 40 MHz sampling clock. The time difference between the pre-trigger, the beam particle arrival, and the next signal sampling was determined by a time to digital converter (TDC).

Figure 3.3 shows a block diagram of the front-end, read-out and trigger electronics.

### 3.5 Data Acquisition System

The data acquisition system (DAQ) consists of the following components [36]:

* HEC Read-Out Driver (ROD)
* EMEC Mini-RODs
* Beam and Timing DAQ
* Event Builder.

The first three sub-systems read the detectors out during the SPS burst of 2.4 seconds and combine the data to Event Fragments for each sub-detector. These are sent in the

Figure 3.3: Block diagram of the front-end, read-out and trigger electronics [35]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:36]

## Chapter 3 Beam Tests

* measure the inter-channel cross-talk.

The calibration system allows to inject a known current pulse to the electrodes of each read-out cell which is then read out via the usual read-out chain. The charge can be injected in only one channel or in all channels at the same time. From the difference in response of these two modes the inter-channel cross-talk can be determined.

#### Concept of the Response Function

The response \(S(t)\) of an electronic system to a time dependent current pulse \(i(t)\) is given by the convolution of the current pulse with the response function \(h(t)\):

\[S(t)=i(t)\otimes h(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}i(t-u)h(u)\mathrm{d}u. \tag{3.2}\]

To avoid the convolution one often uses the frequency domain, which is linked to the time domain by an (inverse) Laplace transformation. Applying the Laplace transformation \(\mathcal{L}\) to equation (3.2) yields:

\[\mathcal{L}[S(t)]=\mathcal{L}[i(t)\otimes h(t)]=\mathcal{L}[i(t)]\cdot \mathcal{L}[h(t)]. \tag{3.3}\]

Let \(I(s)=\mathcal{L}[i(t)]\) be the current pulse and \(H(s)=\mathcal{L}[h(t)]\) the response function in the frequency domain, with \(s=i\omega\) being the imaginary frequency. Then the Laplace transformed of the response is just the product of \(I(s)\) and \(H(s)\):

\[\mathcal{L}[S(t)]=I(s)\cdot H(s). \tag{3.4}\]

The response in the time domain is then given by applying an inverse Laplace transformation:

\[S(t)=\mathcal{L}^{-1}[I(s)\cdot H(s)]=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{-i\infty}^{+i \infty}[I(s)\cdot H(s)]e^{st}\mathrm{d}s. \tag{3.5}\]

#### HEC Calibration

The parameters of the HEC electronics chain, see figure 3.4, are known in detail from laboratory measurements [39]. The full response functions of the calibration, the cold and the warm electronics chain in the beam test setup in the frequency domain are given by [40]:\[H_{\rm calibration}(s) = \frac{a_{\rm c}(1+s\cdot\tau_{\rm zc})}{(1+s\cdot\tau_{\rm pc})(1+s \cdot\tau_{\rm 0c})}\;,\] \[H_{\rm cold}(s) = \frac{R_{\rm p}}{(1+s\cdot\tau_{\rm z})(1+s\cdot\tau_{\rm d})} \cdot\frac{a_{\rm s}(1+s\cdot\tau_{\rm zs})}{(1+s\cdot\tau_{\rm ps})(1+s\cdot \tau_{\rm 0s})}\;,\] \[H_{\rm warm}(s,\tau_{\rm i},\tau_{\rm s}) = \frac{G_{\rm p}(1+s\cdot\tau_{\rm pz})}{(1+s\cdot\tau_{\rm i})(1+s \cdot\tau_{\rm 0})}\cdot\frac{3.69\,G_{\rm s}s\cdot\tau_{\rm s}}{(1+s\cdot\tau_{\rm s })^{3}}\cdot\frac{1}{(1+s\cdot\tau_{\rm fd})}\;.\]

\(H_{\rm calibration}(s)\) describes the response function of the calibration generator chain, \(H_{\rm cold}(s)\) describes the cold electronics and cables in the liquid argon volume and \(H_{\rm warm}(s,\tau_{\rm i},\tau_{\rm s})\) corresponds to the warm electronics part. The different parameters are explained in table 3.1.

Only the time constants of the preshaper, \(\tau_{\rm i}\), and of the shaper, \(\tau_{\rm s}\), are not known and have to be determined from a fit of the predicted signal shape to the measured calibration signal shape S(t):

\[S(t)\equiv{\cal L}^{-1}[I_{\rm calibration}(s)\cdot H_{\rm calibration }(s)]\otimes{\cal L}^{-1}[H_{\rm cold}(s)\cdot H_{\rm warm}(s,\tau_{\rm i}, \tau_{\rm s})]\;. \tag{3.6}\]

Figure 3.4: Schematics of the HEC electronics chain, showing the calibration generator board (CalGen), the preshaper (PR), the shaper and the FEB driver (SH&DR) located in the warm and the calibration distributrion board (CDB), the strip line (SL), the detector gap (DET) as well as preamplifier and summing board (PSB) located in cold L Ar [35].

The calibration pulse is formed by an inductor with a small internal resistivity and thus has a time dependence of an exponential decay together with some step component \(i_{\text{calibration}}(t)=I_{0}[(1-\alpha)e^{-t/\tau}+\alpha]\vartheta(t)\) for \(t>0\), where \(\tau\) is the exponential decay time, \(\alpha\) is the step fraction, \(\vartheta(t)\) is the unit step at \(t=0\) and \(I_{0}\) is the current amplitude. In the frequency domain this reads:

\[I_{\text{calibration}}(s)=\frac{\alpha+s\tau_{c}}{s\cdot(1+s\tau_{c})}\;. \tag{3.7}\]

The inverse Laplace transformation of \(H_{\text{cold}}(s)\cdot H_{\text{warm}}(s,\tau_{\text{i}},\tau_{\text{s}})\) is not calculated directly. The product is rather expanded in partial fractions:

\[\frac{(s+z_{1})\cdot(s+z_{2})\cdot\ldots\cdot(s+z_{m})}{(s+p_{1})\cdot(s+p_{2} )\cdot\ldots\cdot(s+p_{n})}\equiv\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{d_{k}}{s+p_{k}}\;, \tag{3.8}\]

for which the transformation can be calculated more easily. The coefficients \(d_{k}(\tau_{\text{i}},\tau_{\text{s}})\) and \(p_{k}(\tau_{\text{i}},\tau_{\text{s}})\) are computed numerically in the fit procedure. To be able to apply the expansion

to \(H_{\mathrm{warm}}(s,\tau_{\mathrm{i}},\tau_{\mathrm{s}})\), one approximation was made: The triple pole \((1+s\cdot\tau_{\mathrm{s}})^{3}\) in \(H_{\mathrm{warm}}(s)\) was substituted by the product of three single poles with very close time constants of \(\tau_{\mathrm{s}}\pm 0.1\) ns.

Figure 3.5 shows the fit to the signal shape for a typical HEC channel. The fit residua are well within \(\pm 1.5\%\), except from a somewhat larger deviation in the signal rise.

The main difference between the ionization pulse shape and the calibration pulse is the different time dependence of the input currents. While the calibration pulse has an exponential time dependence, the ionization current has a triangular time dependence \(i_{\mathrm{ionization}}(t)=I_{0}(1-t/\tau)\) for \(t\in[0,\tau]\).

The obtained shaper constants are then used to convolute the triangular ionization current

Figure 3.5: Upper figure: the measured calibration signal (black triangles) in the HEC channel 45, fitted by the full electronics function (red line) with the time constants of the preshaper, \(\tau_{\mathrm{i}}\), and the shaper, \(\tau_{\mathrm{s}}\), as free parameters. Lower figure: the residua of the fit [41].

with the electronics response function and thus to predict the signal shape of the physics signal:

\[S_{\text{ionization}}(t)=i_{\text{ionization}}(t)\otimes\mathcal{L}^{-1}[H_{\text{ cold}}(s)\cdot H_{\text{warm}}(s,\tau_{\text{i}},\tau_{\text{s}})]. \tag{3.9}\]

In figure 3.6 the normalized predicted signal shape for the same HEC channel, shown in figure 3.5, is compared with the observed signal shape for pions. The relative differences of the shapes around the signal maximum are well within \(\pm 1.5\%\) with some larger differences at the beginning of the signal. The predicted signal shape is then used to compute the optimal filter weights, see chapter 4.

To determine the relationship between the ionization current in the liquid argon gaps and the ADC output for physics events,

* charge pulses of different size are injected in every channel and
* the measured calibration signal shapes are transformed to triangle pulse shapes corresponding to the same current.

Thereafter the relation between the current, \(I\), and the amplitude of the triangular pulse shape, \(A\), above the pedestal \(A_{0}\), the base ADC level for zero input, is fitted by a linear or cubic polynomial, see figure 3.7:

Figure 3.6: Upper figure: comparison of the measured normalized particle signal (black triangles) with the predicted signal shape (red line) in HEC channel 45. Lower figure: the relative difference between the measurement and the prediction [41].

\[I[\text{nA}]=\sum_{i=0}^{1\text{ or }3}p_{i}\cdot A^{i}[\text{AD\,C\ counts}]\, \tag{3.10}\]

resulting in the calibration coefficients \(p_{i}\). For most channels the coefficients \(p_{2}\) and \(p_{3}\) of the non-linear terms are compatible with zero. The coefficient \(p_{0}\) accounts for a constant offset between the set current and the real injected current and is not used to convert the amplitude of physics signals from ADC counts into the corresponding current.

#### EMEC Calibration

In contrast to the HEC not all parameters of the EMEC electronics chain have been measured directly. Moreover the calibration signal is not injected directly to the read-out electrodes of the physics signal, so the signal chain for particle signals differs from the one of the calibration signals, which includes a sizeable \(LC_{D}\) part [35]. The difference between the electronics chain of physics and calibration signals is shown in figure 3.8.

The calibration pulse is the sum of an exponential and a step function \(\vartheta(t)\):

\[i_{\text{calibration}}(t)=I_{0}[(1-\alpha)e^{-t/T_{C}}+\alpha]\vartheta(t)\, \tag{3.11}\]

where the time constant of the exponential part, \(T_{C}\), and the step size, \(\alpha\), are unknown.

The ionization signal pulse shape is directly calculated in a three step procedure using the measured calibration signal [42]: First the measured calibration waveform is numerically transformed into the waveform of a single step function:

Figure 3.7: Calibration function for conversion of the ADC output to the ionization current in the liquid argon gaps. Shown are the measurements (black triangles) together with a cubic fit (red line) for the HEC channel 45 [41].

\[S_{\rm step}(t,\alpha,T_{C})\equiv{\cal L}^{-1}\left[\frac{{\cal L}[S_{\rm calibration }(t)]}{I_{\rm calibration}(s,\alpha,T_{C})}I_{\rm step}(s)\right]. \tag{3.12}\]

Regardless of the other electronics parameters, \(S_{\rm step}(t,\alpha,T_{C})\) is expected to converge fast to zero. Thus the parameters \(T_{C}\) and \(\alpha\) can be found by minimizing the tail of \(S_{\rm step}(t,\alpha,T_{C})\).

The step response signal still has contributions from oscillations due to the \(LC_{\rm D}\) component. In a second step the \(LC_{\rm D}\) parameter can be determined by calculating numerically the response of the electronics chain to a pure cosine current \(i(t)=\cos(\omega t)\):

\[C(t)={\cal L}^{-1}\left[\frac{{\cal L}[S_{\rm step}(t,\alpha,T_{C})]}{I_{\rm step }(s)}{\cal L}[\cos(\omega t)]\right]. \tag{3.13}\]

For a frequency \(\omega=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC_{\rm D}}}\) the response is expected to be zero. The \(LC_{\rm D}\) parameter is again determined by a minimization of the long tail of \(C(t)\).

In a last step the dependence on the \(LC_{\rm D}\) part is numerically taken out of the step response signal, which is then transfered to the signal for a triangular ionization current input:

\[S_{\rm ionization}(t)=i_{\rm ionization}(t)\otimes{\cal L}^{-1}\left[\frac{{ \cal L}[S_{\rm step}(t)]}{H(LC_{\rm D},s)}\frac{1}{I_{\rm step}(s)}\right]. \tag{3.14}\]

Figure 3.9 compares the normalized predicted signal shape for the EMEC channel 701 with the observed signal shape for pions. The relative differences of the shapes around

The charge is not directly injected to the read-out electrodes, which leads to a sizeable \(LC_{\rm D}\) part [35]. \(Hc(s)\) and \(Ha(s)\) denote the response functions of the calibration and the read-out electronics, respectively. \(I_{\rm cal}(s)\) and \(Ip(s)=I_{\rm ionization}(s)\) denote the calibration and physics (ionization) currents. \(C_{\rm D}\) is the capacitance of the detector gap.

the signal maximum are well within a few percent, whereas the signal rise and fall are not optimally modeled. The data and predictions deviate up to 15 % in the signal rise. Nevertheless the predicted signal shape is used to compute optimal filter weights, see chapter 4.

The remaining calibration procedure follows the steps of the HEC calibration.

### 3.7 Beam Test Data Samples

In total 743 runs have been taken with electrons, pions or muons in the energy range between 6 GeV and 200 GeV with about 25 million triggers in total.

Energy scans with electrons and pions have been performed at 9 standard beam impact points. In figure 3.11 the standard impact positions on the front planes of EMEC and HEC are shown together with the read-out structure of the first EMEC and HEC layers and a projection of the beam window of the cryostat.

To check the uniformity of the EMEC and HEC response in detail, horizontal and vertical scans with pions at energies of 30, 150 and 200 GeV and muons at energies of 120 and 150 GeV have been carried out as well as a dedicated uniformity study of the EMEC with 119 GeV positrons at eight surrounding points for each of the standard impact points, see figure 3.10.

Figure 3.9: Upper figure: Comparison of the measured normalized particle signal (red circles) with the predicted signal shape (black line) in the EMEC channel 701. Lower figure: Relative difference between measurement and prediction [41]. Data and predictions deviate up to 15 % in the signal rise, whereas the peak is well described.

Also the effect of different amounts of dead material in front of the calorimeter on the response of the presampler, EMEC and HEC has been studied by placing a variable number of absorber plates in front of the cryostat.

## Chapter 4 Signal Reconstruction

For each event 16 time samples of the ionization current pulse are recorded for each HEC read-out channel together with 7 signal time samples for each EMEC read-out channel. In this chapter the reconstruction of the ionization signal from the recorded time samples will be studied. The procedure is as follows:

* First, the pedestal, the base ADC level for zero input, is calculated.
* The pedestal is then subtracted from all signal time samples.
* Then the amplitude and time position of the signal is calculated for each event, using either a cubic interpolation, the optimal filter or a simple integral reconstruction, as described below.
* Finally, the response is converted from ADC counts to nA using the calibration coefficients.

As examples figures 4.1 and 4.2 show the normalized reconstructed signal shapes (blue points) of a typical HEC and EMEC channel for a 120 GeV pion run after subtraction of the pedestal. Also shown are the 16 (7) recorded discrete read-out time samples of the signal pulse in the HEC (EMEC) channel for a particular event (red points). The first five signal samples of the HEC signal are in the pedestal region, whereas only the first sample of the EMEC signal is in the pedestal region.

The reconstruction of the signal shape uses the feature of the signal read-out in the beam test, that the read-out clock is not synchronized with the beam trigger, see section 3.4. Therefore the relative position of the recorded signal samples with respect to the position of the signal shape varies event by event. The time between the trigger and the first read-out sample is equally distributed in the range \(t_{\mathrm{rel}}\in[0,25)\) ns and can be determined directly by a time to digital converter (TDC) or using the global cubic timing, see section 4.3.2.

The time samples of the considered EMEC and HEC channels are normalized event by event to the reconstructed amplitude using the optimal filter technique, see section 4.2.3. The shown signal shapes in figures 4.1 and 4.2 represent the average normalized signal sample as a function of the time after the beam trigger for one run.

## Chapter 4 Signal Reconstruction

Figure 4.1: Reconstructed signal shape of a typical HEC channel after pedestal subtraction: Average signal sample (blue points), normalized to the reconstructed amplitude using optimal filtering, as a function of the time after the beam trigger for a 120 GeV pion run. Shown are also the 16 recorded time samples of one particular event (red points) and a cubic interpolation of the four time samples around the signal peak (red line). The first five time samples are in the pedestal region, they do not contain a signal contribution.

Figure 4.2: Reconstructed signal shape of a typical EMEC channel after pedestal subtraction: Average signal sample (blue points), normalized to the reconstructed amplitude using optimal filtering, as a function of the time after the beam trigger for a 120 GeV pion run. Shown are also the 7 recorded time samples of one particular event (red points) and a cubic interpolation of the four time samples around the signal peak (red line). The first time sample is in the pedestal region, it does not contain a signal contribution.

The accuracy of the shown reconstructed signal shapes depends on the accuracy of the timing using the global cubic time and of the amplitude reconstruction with the optimal filter.

### 4.1 Pedestal Computation

For the HEC the first 5 time samples occurred before the actual signal rise, see figure 4.1. Therefore they can be used to compute the pedestal, the base level of the ADC for zero input. The 7 recorded time samples for the EMEC are centered around the signal peak, see figure 4.2, only the very first time sample lies in the pedestal region.

As the pedestal is known to be stable over one run, it is calculated in units of ADC counts from the time samples in the pedestal region for each run and each EMEC and HEC read-out channel. Therefore a two step procedure is applied:

From the first time sample a preliminary pedestal and pedestal variance are calculated for the first 200 events of the run. Thereafter the final pedestal is calculated from the following events of the run, but not more than 4800, with the requirement that the used time samples do not differ by more than three times the preliminary root mean squared from the preliminary pedestal.

### 4.2 Signal Amplitude and Time Reconstruction

After the pedestal is subtracted from the time samples of the ionization signal, the signal amplitude and also the time of the signal peak have to be reconstructed. Therefore the methods of cubic interpolation, a simple integral reconstruction or the optimal filter are used. They are described below.

#### Cubic Interpolation

The cubic interpolation allows to find the signal peak height (in ADC counts) and time (with respect to the read-out clock) for an individual channel in an individual event without any knowledge about the signal shape or the timing of the read-out samples with respect to the beam trigger.

Four time samples around the signal peak are chosen, such that the second sample is the maximum sample of the event. The four samples are interpolated with a cubic polynomial, see figures 4.1 and 4.2:

\[S(t_{i}+\Delta t)=a_{0}+a_{1}\,\Delta t+a_{2}(\Delta t)^{2}+a_{3}(\Delta t)^{3 }. \tag{4.1}\]

\(S(t_{i}+\Delta t)\) is the interpolated signal shape, the \(a_{i}\) are the four parameters of the polynomial and \(\Delta t=t-t_{i}\), with \(t_{i}\) being the clock time of the first time sample used in the cubic interpolation. The four parameters \(a_{i}\) are obtained by solving a system of equations for the four time samples:\[\left(\begin{array}{c}S(t_{i})\\ S(t_{i}+\Delta T)\\ S(t_{i}+2\Delta T)\\ S(t_{i}+3\Delta T)\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}1&0&0&0\\ 1&\Delta T&(\Delta T)^{2}&(\Delta T)^{3}\\ 1&2\Delta T&4(\Delta T)^{2}&8(\Delta T)^{3}\\ 1&3\Delta T&9(\Delta T)^{2}&27(\Delta T)^{3}\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array} []{c}a_{0}\\ a_{1}\\ a_{2}\\ a_{3}\end{array}\right)\, \tag{4.2}\]

with \(\Delta T=25\) ns being the read-out clock period.

The time difference between the signal maximum and the first read-out clock tick after the beam trigger, \(t_{\rm cubic}\), is then given by:

\[t_{\rm cubic}=t_{i}+\frac{-a_{2}-\sqrt{a_{2}^{2}-3a_{1}a_{3}}}{3a_{3}}. \tag{4.3}\]

\(t_{\rm cubic}\) depends on the relative timing \(t_{\rm rel}\) between the beam trigger and the read-out clock, as is illustrated in figure 4.3:

\[t_{\rm peak}=t_{\rm rel}+t_{\rm cubic}\, \tag{4.4}\]

where \(t_{\rm peak}\) is a constant for each channel.

The reconstructed signal amplitude \(\overline{E}\) is given by:

\[\overline{E}=S(t_{\rm cubic}). \tag{4.5}\]

As for the cubic interpolation method no information about the signal shape and timing is used it does not optimally reconstruct the signal:

Figure 4.3: Timing for asynchronous beam triggers with respect to the read-out clock. \(t_{\rm rel}\) is the time difference between the asynchronous beam trigger and the first read-out clock tick, \(t_{\rm cubic}\) is the time difference between the first clock tick and the signal maximum, obtained by the cubic interpolation method, and \(t_{\rm peak}\) is the constant time between the trigger and the signal maximum.

* for small signals the cubic interpolation is biased towards large positive values of the reconstructed signal amplitude due to the use of the maximal signal sample as starting point for the interplotion [43], see figure 4.4,
* even for large signals the cubic interpolation suffers from the fact that the real signal shape is not a cubic polynomial.

#### Simple Integral Reconstruction

As the cubic interpolation is biased towards positive values for small signals, a simple integral reconstruction method has been developed for small signals that gives an unbiased estimate of the signal height and time from the recorded signal samples without any further information.

The basic idea is to implement a "poor man's digital filter" by just adding 5 pedestal subtracted samples \(S_{i}\) (samples 5 to 9 for the HEC and 2 to 6 for the EMEC) with a constant weight of 1/2.6 [44], which is found empirically. The reconstructed signal amplitude \(\overline{E}\) is then given by:

\[\overline{E}=\sum_{i=i_{0}+4}^{i=i_{0}+4}\frac{1}{2.6}\cdot S_{i}\, \tag{4.6}\]

where \(i_{0}=2\) and \(i_{0}=5\) are the start time samples for the EMEC and the HEC, respectively. The signal peak time relative to the read-out clock is reconstructed using a weighted mean of the time samples:

\[t_{\text{integral}}=\sum_{i=i_{0}}^{i=i_{0}+4}\frac{1}{2.6}\cdot S_{i}(t_{i}-t _{i_{0}}). \tag{4.7}\]

To compare the signal reconstruction performance of the cubic fit with the simple integral method, a signal shape from the 2002 beam test, as shown in figure 4.1 is taken and a random noise shape also from the beam test data is added to it. The ratio of signal over noise RMS is scanned from 0 to 100 and all possible time shifts (0 - 25 ns) are tested.

Figure 4.4 shows the difference between the reconstructed and the generated signal amplitude in units of the standard deviation of the noise distribution, \(\sigma_{\text{noise}}\), as a function of the ratio of the reconstructed signal amplitude and \(\sigma_{\text{noise}}\), for the cubic interpolation method and the integral reconstruction. For negative reconstructed amplitudes both methods have a linear bias as negative values are only due to noise. For small reconstructed signal amplitudes the cubic fit has a strong positive bias reaching 100% at a signal to noise ratio of two and falls quickly to 2% at a signal to noise ratio of ten. The integral method has only a slight bias of 5% at a signal to noise ratio of two and no bias at a ratio of ten.

For higher signal to noise ratios the simple integral method starts to be biased towards small reconstructed signal amplitudes whereas the cubic interpolation shows no bias. Therefore the simple integral method is used instead of the cubic interpolation for channels with an absolute signal smaller than 10 times the pedestal RMS.

#### Optimal Filter

In the ATLAS detector the method of optimal filtering [38] is chosen for the signal reconstruction because it combines a fast computation of the signal amplitude and time with the best possible noise suppression. The theory of optimal filtering is outlined in appendix A.

The optimal filter method calculates the signal amplitude \(\overline{E}\) as the weighted sum of five time samples \(S_{i}\) around the signal maximum:

\[\overline{E}=\sum_{i\,=\,i_{0}\,(t_{\mathrm{rel}})\,}^{i=i_{0}\,(t_{\mathrm{rel }})+4}w_{\mathrm{a}\,\mathrm{m}\,p,i}(t_{\mathrm{rel}})\cdot S_{i}. \tag{4.8}\]

Moreover, the optimal filter method yields also an information of the relative time shift \(\tau\) between the reconstructed signal and the predicted signal shape which was used to derive the filter weights:

\[\overline{E}\tau=\sum_{i\,=\,i_{0}\,(t_{\mathrm{rel}})\,}^{i\,=i_{0}\,(t_{ \mathrm{rel}})+4}w_{\mathrm{time},i}(t_{\mathrm{rel}})\cdot S_{i}. \tag{4.9}\]

As explained in appendix A, the digital filter weights \(w_{\mathrm{a}\,\mathrm{m}\,p,i}(t_{\mathrm{rel}})\) and \(w_{\mathrm{time},i}(t_{\mathrm{rel}})\) are calculated from the predicted ionization signal shape (see chapter 3) together with the

Figure 4.4: Difference between the reconstructed and the generated signal in units of the noise standard deviation, as a function of the ratio of the reconstructed signal and the noise standard deviation for the cubic interpolation method (red points) and the simple integral reconstruction (blue points). For small reconstructed signals below 15 times the noise standard deviation the simple integral reconstruction is less biased than the cubic interpolation method [45].

noise autocorrelation matrix for each channel, which was determined in dedicated noise runs.

In contrast to the future ATLAS setup the arrival time of the beam particle at the calorimeter is not synchronized with the signal digitization every 25 ns. Therefore the optimal filter weights depend on the relative time difference \(t_{\mathrm{rel}}\) between the particle arrival, given by the pre-trigger signal, and the 25 ns read-out clock. The dependence of the optimal filter weights on \(t_{\mathrm{rel}}\) is parameterized by a fourth order polynomial [41].

Also the start time sample number \(i_{0}(t_{\mathrm{rel}})\) for the optimal filter depends on \(t_{\mathrm{rel}}\).

### 4.3 Timing: Trigger vs. Read-Out Clock

In contrast to the future ATLAS data taking, the trigger in the beam test is asynchronous with respect to the 40 MHz read-out clock, see section 3.4. The relative timing \(t_{\mathrm{rel}}\) between the read-out clock and the trigger can either be measured directly by a time to digital converter TDC, or it can be derived from a global event time.

As \(t_{\mathrm{rel}}\) is needed as input for the optimal filter weights, the resolution of \(t_{\mathrm{rel}}\) has a strong impact on the amplitude resolution. Figure 4.5 shows the dependence of the reconstructed signal after optimal filtering on the time input. A time shift of 1 ns corresponds to a relative change of 0.83 % of the reconstructed signal [46].

#### TDC Timing

The TDC constantly loops from 0 to 1376 within a total period of 25 ns and a fixed offset, TDC wax (wrap around constant), with respect to the read-out clock. It is read-out after

Figure 4.5: Dependence of the reconstructed signal after optimal filtering on the time input for 150 GeV pions in HEC channel 45. The data points (black stars) are fitted by a linear function (blue line). A time shift of 1 ns corresponds to a relative change of 0.83 % of the reconstructed signal amplitude, after [46].

a positive pre-trigger decision. Thus the relative timing \(t_{\rm rel}\) is given by:

\[t_{\rm rel}\equiv(\rm{TDC~{}counts}+\rm{TDC~{}wac})\times\frac{25~{}ns}{1376~{} counts}\pmod{25~{}ns}\, \tag{4.10}\]

where the TDC wac offset has to be estimated from the data. The time resolution of the TDC together with the pre-trigger logic is about 120 ps [35]. Unfortunately, the TDC was broken for all electron and pion runs of the beam test. Nevertheless it has been operational for most of the muon runs. There the method of global cubic timing, see below, is not applicable.

#### Global Cubic Timing

The relative timing \(t_{\rm rel}\) can also be determined for events with large enough signals from the time information of the cubic interpolation of the signal maximum:

\[t_{\rm rel}=t_{\rm peak}-t_{\rm cubic}~{}, \tag{4.11}\]

where \(t_{\rm cubic}\) is the time difference between the signal maximum and the first clock tick after the asynchronous beam trigger, obtained by the cubic interpolation. \(t_{\rm peak}\) is the constant time between the trigger and the signal maximum, see figure 4.3.

To increase the accuracy, the weighted average of all signal channels in one event is used:

\[t_{\rm rel}=\frac{\sum_{i}\left[t_{\rm peak,i}-t_{\rm cubic,j}\right]\sigma_{t }^{-2}(E_{\rm cubic,i}/\sigma_{\rm\,pedestal,i})}{\sum_{i}\sigma_{t}^{-2}(E_{ \rm cubic,i}/\sigma_{\rm\,pedestal,i})}~{}, \tag{4.12}\]

where the index \(i\) runs over all EMEC and HEC channels and \(\sigma_{t}(E_{\rm cubic,i}/\sigma_{\rm\,pedestal,i})\) is the resolution of the cubic time for channel \(i\), as a function of the ratio of the cubic reconstructed signal amplitude, \(E_{\rm cubic,i}\), to the pedestal RMS, \(\sigma_{\rm\,pedestal,i}\), of this channel. It is parameterized to be (see below):

\[\sigma_{t}^{2}(E_{\rm cubic,i}/\sigma_{\rm\,pedestal,i})=\left(\frac{24.1~{} ns}{E_{\rm cubic,i}/\sigma_{\rm\,pedestal,i}}\right)^{2}+\left(0.55~{}ns \right)^{2}~{}. \tag{4.13}\]

The time \(t_{\rm peak}\) varies from channel to channel - mainly due to differences in cabling - by typically up to \(\pm 10\) ns for the EMEC and \(\pm 3\) ns for the HEC. The HEC channels have a common offset of about \(-5\) ns with respect to the EMEC channels in addition to the 100 ns offset from the four more recorded time samples of the HEC channels. Defining time offsets \(\Delta t_{i}=t_{\rm peak,i}-\it const\) for each channel, the relative time \(t_{\rm rel}\) can be expressed as:

\[t_{\rm rel}=\it const-t_{\rm Global}~{},\quad t_{\rm Global}=\frac{\sum_{i} \left[t_{\rm cubic,i}-\Delta t_{i}\right]\sigma_{t}^{-2}(E_{\rm cubic,i}/ \sigma_{\rm\,pedestal,i})}{\sum_{i}\sigma_{t}^{-2}(E_{\rm cubic,i}/\sigma_{ \rm\,pedestal,i})}~{}, \tag{4.14}\]where \(t_{\text{Global}}\) is the "global cubic event time". The channel offsets \(\Delta t_{i}\) have been defined from a global fit minimizing the channel-to-channel time differences for all EMEC and HEC channels over all runs, as described below. In order not to be biased by noise, only channels with a signal to noise ratio of at least 3.5 and a signal amplitude of at least 25 ADC counts are used to compute \(t_{\text{Global}}\).

##### Determination of the Time Offsets

The time offsets \(\boldsymbol{\Delta t}\) have been fitted directly to moments of the channel-to-channel cubic time differences with the constraint that all offsets sum up to zero. The fit included EMEC and HEC channels simultaneously with the HEC signal times adjusted by \(-100\) ns in order to take the 4 more time samples in the pedestal region of the HEC into account and to make the cubic times of HEC and EMEC similar. The following \(\chi^{2}\left(\boldsymbol{\Delta t}\right)\) was minimized:

\[\chi^{2}\left(\boldsymbol{\Delta t}\right)=\sum_{i<j}\frac{\left[\left\langle \Delta t_{\text{cubic}}\right\rangle_{ij}-\left(\Delta t_{i}-\Delta t_{j} \right)\right]^{2}\left(\#\text{events}\right)_{ij}}{\left[\left\langle\left( \Delta t_{\text{cubic}}\right)^{2}\right\rangle_{ij}-\left\langle\Delta t_{ \text{cubic}}\right\rangle_{ij}^{2}\right]},\quad\text{with}\quad\sum_{i} \Delta t_{i}=0\, \tag{4.15}\]

where the indices \(i\) and \(j\) run over all EMEC and HEC channels and \(\left(\#\text{events}\right)_{ij}\) denotes the number of events, in which the channels \(i\) and \(j\) both are hit. The constraint that all time offsets add up to zero is allowed because else the \(\chi^{2}\left(\Delta t\right)\) would be invariant under a constant shift of the \(\Delta t_{i}\) and thus the minimization would be under constrained.

The moments of the channel-to-channel cubic time differences are given by:

\[\left\langle\left(\Delta t_{\text{cubic}}\right)^{n}\right\rangle_{ij}=\sum_ {\text{events}\left(i\,j\right)}\frac{\left(t_{\text{cubic},i}-t_{\text{ cubic},j}\right)^{n}}{\left(\#\text{events}\right)_{ij}}\, \tag{4.16}\]

where the sum runs over all events, in which the channels \(i\) and \(j\) both are hit.

Only channels with a signal of at least 3.5 times the RMS of the pedestal value and at least 25 ADC counts have been considered. Moreover channels only have been taken into account, if they are part of at least one channel-pair that was hit more than 100 times simultaneously. In order to reduce biases by noisy channels and random hits outside the desired impact region the channels were required to have at least one corner inside an ellipse around the nominal beam impact position with a half-axis of 15 cm horizontally and 20 cm vertically.

In all, time offsets have been fit for 47 out of 384 HEC and 576 out of 1152 EMEC channels from 116689 channel-to-channel cubic time differences of all available runs including electron, pion and muon data. The statistical errors of the derived time offsets are scaled to obtain a \(\chi^{2}/\text{n.d.f.}=1\). The resulting time offsets are shown in figure 4.6.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:56]

### 4.4 Timing: Calibration Pulses vs. Physics Signals

As explained above, the optimal filter weights have been derived from the predicted ionization signal from calibration pulses. Due to cable delays in the calibration circuit, the time

Figure 4.8: Cubic time resolution: Distribution of the difference between the time of the channel with the highest signal to noise ratio minus the time offset \(\Delta t\) and the global cubic time \(t_{\rm Global}\), computed without this channel (black histogram) together with a double-Gaussian fit (blue line).

between the particle impact on the calorimeter and the signal peak can be different from the time between the charge injection using the calibration circuit and the corresponding signal peak.

Thus the physics signal is shifted in time by \(T_{0}\) with respect to the signal shape, which was used to calculate the optimal filter weights, as given by the optimal filter time:

\[\overline{E\cdot T_{0}}=\sum_{i=i_{0}(t_{\mathrm{rel}})\atop\text{$\left\| \right\|$}}^{i=i_{0}(t_{\mathrm{rel}})+4}w_{\text{time},i}(t_{\mathrm{rel}}) \cdot S_{i}. \tag{4.18}\]

This time shift \(T_{0}\), which is different for different channels, has been computed as the mean of the optimal filter time over all events and all runs. In all, time shifts have been determined with an uncertainty of less than 5 ns for 827 EMEC and 79 HEC channels and are shown in figure 4.9.

Thereafter the \(T_{0}\)'s are subtracted from \(t_{\mathrm{rel}}\) as input for the optimal filter:

\[\overline{E}=\sum_{i=i_{0}(t_{\mathrm{rel}})\atop\text{$\left\| \right\|$}}^{i=i_{0}(t_{\mathrm{rel}})+4}w_{\text{amp},i}(t_{\mathrm{rel}}-T_{ 0})\cdot S_{i},\qquad\overline{E\cdot T_{1}}=\sum_{i=i_{0}(t_{\mathrm{rel}}) \atop\text{$\left\|\right\|$}=i_{0}(t_{\mathrm{rel}})}w_{\text{time},i}(t_{ \mathrm{rel}}-T_{0})\cdot S_{i}. \tag{4.19}\]

In figure 4.10 the optimal filter time \(T_{1}\) for all EMEC channels within an ellipse around the beam impact point with a 20 cm half axis horizontally and a 26.7 cm half axis vertically for 119 GeV positrons after the application of the time offsets \(T_{0}\) are shown together. The distribution peaks nearly at zero and has a width of about 2 ns together with a long tail.

The \(T_{0}\)'s depend only on the way the optimal filter weights are produced, they do not depend on the choice of TDC or global cubic time as event time.

### 4.5 Electronics Noise Reduction by the Optimal Filter

As described above, the electronic noise was evaluated from the RMS of the signal samples in the pedestal region over an entire run. The optimal filter suppresses the noise contribution to the reconstructed signal, see appendix A.

To assess the noise reduction by the optimal filter the procedure of optimal filtering was applied to the first five time samples for each HEC channel. Figure 4.11 shows the optimal filter output, normalized to the pedestal RMS for all HEC channels. The distribution is symmetric and centered around zero with a standard deviation of about 0.6. Therefore the optimal filter reduces the noise of the HEC channels by 40%, which is close to the theoretical noise reduction factor of 1.7 for a typical signal shape with electronics noise only, see appendix A. The noise reduction close to the theoretical value indicates that the pulse shape and the noise properties of the HEC channels are well modeled and the optimal filter weights are calculated with a good precision.

For the EMEC only the very first time sample lies in the pedestal region. The noise reduction of the optimal filter was therefore obtained from the distribution of the optimal filtered signal amplitudes of a muon run excluding the channels which were directly hit by the muon. Also for the EMEC the noise after optimal filtering is symmetric around zero and is reduced by 30% with respect to the RMS of the pedestal samples, see figure 4.12. The noise reduction factor of less than 1.7 might indicate some room for improvement in the modeling of the pulse shapes and noise properties of the EMEC channels and in the derivation of the optimal filter weights.

Figure 4.10: Distribution of the optimal filter time \(T_{1}\) after application of the “calibration-to-physics” time constants \(T_{0}\) for the EMEC channels within an ellipse around the beam impact point with a 20 cm half axis horizontally and a 26.7 cm half axis vertically for 119 GeV positrons. The distribution consists of a core with a width of about 2ns and a long tail.

## Chapter 5 Monte Carlo Simulations

As the future ATLAS setup differs from the beam test setup, the ability to simulate the calorimeter response both in the beam test and in the ATLAS detector is crucial to transfer the calibration constants and reconstruction algorithms from the beam tests to the ATLAS detector [47], see chapter 11. Therefore special simulation software packages have been prepared [48] using a Monte Carlo (MC) method, for a review refer to [16].

These simulations have to be tuned to describe the beam test data as good as possible and will then be used to simulate the calorimeters in the future ATLAS setup to develop reconstruction algorithms for jets in ATLAS.

### 5.1 Geant3

The first MC simulation package uses the GEANT 3 program [49] (version 3.21) to simulate the response of the EMEC and HEC, including the presampler, with respect to various beam particles. It is based on the simulations for the HEC stand-alone beam tests [50]. For the hadronic shower simulations the GCALOR code [51] is used.

The beam test setup is modeled in detail. The calorimeter geometries include not only the absorber plates and liquid argon gaps, but also the electrodes and read-out structures [52]. Moreover, the cryostat walls, the liquid argon excluder and all beam elements, such as wire chambers and scintillation counters, are included in the geometry description. All shower particles that leave the calorimeter are taken into account by special virtual leakage detectors surrounding the calorimeter modules. Figures 5.1 and 5.2 show the modeled calorimeter modules and the leakage detectors, respectively.

For each simulated event the following quantities are stored:

* visible energy (ionization and excitation energy losses) in all readout channels of the used calorimeter modules
* kinetic and total energy of the shower particles that leave the calorimeter (leakage)
* hit wires of the wire chambers
* energy deposits in the trigger counters F1 and F2.

### 5.2 Geant4

The second MC simulation package uses the GEANT4 program [53] (version 5.0) to simulate the response of the EMEC and HEC. GEANT4 was developed in the 1 990's by a worldwide collaboration as a fully object oriented simulation toolkit based on the programming language C++. In contrast, GEANT3 is based on the programming language FORTRAN. One major purpose of the development of GEANT4 is the simulation of the LHC experiments. Recently it has been chosen to be the principal simulation tool for ATLAS.

The geometrical description of the beam test setup is at the same level of details as in

Figure 5.1: GEANT3 simulation of the beam test setup [50].

Figure 5.2: Leakage detectors in the GEANT3 simulation [50].

## Chapter 5 Monte Carlo Simulations

GEANT3. Again for each simulated event the visible energy in all readout channels, the leakage energy and the deposits in the wire chambers and trigger counters are stored. Furthermore, it is possible to store not only the visible energy per channel, but also the energy deposits in each liquid argon gap of the HEC separately, which is of special importance to simulate single gap high voltage failures, see chapter 7.

In GEANT4 the physics processes are implemented in a very open scheme with no "default" physics [52]. This allows an easy implementation of new or alternative physics models.

The physics models are being constantly validated and improved by comparison between the GEANT4 predictions and the experimental results in various beam tests and experiments. The description of electromagnetic processes is very similar to GEANT3 with minor additions only. Contrary to that completely new non-parametrical models for nuclear interactions have been developed. These models have to be tuned to optimally describe hadronic showers and the best model has to be identified.

From the proposed physics lists [54] for hadronic shower simulations in GEANT4 two physics lists have been selected for the comparison of the data with MC: LHEP and QGSP.

The LHEP physics list uses the Low and High Energy Pion parameterization models for inelastic scattering. In contrast, the QGSP physics list is based on theory driven models for the reactions of energetic pions, kaons, and nucleons. It employs the Quark-Gluon String model for the 'punch-through' interactions of the projectile with a nucleus and a Pre-equilibrium decay model with an extensive evaporation phase to model the behavior of the nucleus 'after the punch'. It uses the current best values for pion cross-sections.

### 5.3 Simulated Data

With GEANT3 energy scans at the five standard impact points E, F, I, J, K (see figure 3.11) have been simulated for:

* negative pions: 12 energies, \(10-200\) GeV, 5000 events per point and energy
* electrons: 11 energies, \(6-147.8\) GeV, 5000 events per point and energy
* negative muons: 3 energies: 120, 150 and 180 GeV, 20000 events per point and energy.

Using GEANT4 energy scans at the two standard impact points I and J have been simulated with the same particles, energies and numbers of events as in GEANT3. In addition x- and y-scans have been performed with stored energy deposits in all liquid argon gaps separately and inside the EMEC and HEC absorbers:

* x-scan with negative pions of 200 GeV, at \(y=0\) mm and 14 impact points in the range \(-26\) cm \(\leq x\leq\) 0 cm with 2000 events each
* y-scan with negative muons of 150 GeV, at \(x=70\) mm and 29 impact points in the range \(-18\) cm \(\leq y\leq 10\) cm with 10000 events each.

The shift of the calorimeter modules with respect to the nominal position in the cryostat, see chapter 7, has been taken into account in the simulations. For all simulations "pencil-like" beams without vertex smearing were used. This might cause differences between the simulation and the real calorimeter response, as in reality the response is the average over different beam impact points according to the beam profile. The simulated signals do not contain contributions due to electronics noise.

### 5.4 Energy Leakage

The calibration of the EMEC and HEC[47] is based on the reconstruction of the true deposited energy inside the calorimeters. Therefore it is necessary to determine the energy of the shower particles which leave the calorimeters, known as leakage. The only information about the leakage can be obtained from MC simulations.

There are two definitions of the leakage[48]. On the one hand, it is the sum of the kinetic energies of all particles that leave the calorimeter. On the other hand, one can also take into account the rest mass of the produced shower particles by summing the total energies of all particles that leave the calorimeters, except for nucleons where only the kinetic energy is used.

The leakage for electrons was found to be negligible. The total energy leakage for pions is predicted to be between 4% (GEANT4 QGSP) and 6% (GEANT3 and GEANT4 LHEP) of the beam energy with a rather weak energy dependence, see figure 5.3. The two leakage definitions differ only by a margin, so the first definition has been used.

Figure 5.3: Predicted energy leakage out of the calorimeter modules for pions at the impact point J as functions of the beam energy from GEANT3 (blue triangles) and GEANT4 QGSP and LHEP (green squares and red points, respectively) [48].

### 5.5 Electromagnetic Scale Calibration

The electromagnetic scale constant \(\alpha_{\mathrm{MC}}^{\mathrm{EM}}\) for the MC simulations is defined to be the proportionality factor between the deposited energy in an electromagnetic shower, \(E_{\mathrm{depo}}^{\mathrm{EM}}\), and the observed "visible energy", \(E_{\mathrm{vis}}\), in the liquid argon:

\[E_{\mathrm{depo}}^{\mathrm{EM}} = \alpha_{\mathrm{MC}}^{\mathrm{EM}}E_{\mathrm{vis}}. \tag{5.1}\]

The MC simulations yield electromagnetic scale constants for the EMEC of 11.35 and 12.05 for GEANT3 and GEANT4 respectively [48]. The scale constants of the HEC were determined by former HEC stand alone simulations to be 23.3 and 23.7 using GEANT3 and GEANT4 respectively. As no hadronic processes are involved, all GEANT4 simulations (independent of the choice of the hadronic shower code) have the same electromagnetic scale constant.

The output quantity of "visible energy" only accounts for energy losses due to electromagnetic processes, such as ionization and excitation, so the above relation between the total deposited energy and the visible energy does in general not hold for hadronic showers.

## Chapter 6 Offline Reconstruction

The purpose of the offline reconstruction software and algorithms is to condense the data and to suppress the noise contribution to the total calorimeter signal. The ultimate goal is to determine the following quantities from the recorded time samples of all EMEC and HEC channels for each event:

* the total ionization current in EMEC and HEC, least influenced by the electronics noise
* a measure to distinguish electromagnetic from hadronic energy deposits
* the particle impact position from the distribution of the calorimeter signals
* the particle impact position using the MWPC tracking information.

In a first step the ionization signals and time shifts are calculated from the recorded time samples for all EMEC and HEC channels in all events, as described in chapter 4. Moreover the information of the MWPCs and scintillation counters is reconstructed event by event and the MWPC information is used to fit the track of the incoming particle. Thereby the problem that the data of the different sub-detectors are out of phase for some runs, see section 3.5 and section 6.1.4 below, has to be corrected for.

In a second step the ionization signals in the EMEC and HEC read-out channels are combined to two dimensional clusters using a topological neighboring criterion to suppress random electronics noise. The clusters serve as an input for all further analysis of the beam test data, especially for the energy and position reconstruction.

### 6.1 Signal Reconstruction in the ATHENA Framework

The data of previous HEC stand-alone beam tests has been analyzed with a dedicated, FORTRAN-based software package called HECADC[55], which was also used for quasi-online monitoring of the data by analyzing the output of each current DAQ run. For the EMEC/HEC combined beam test the existing analysis and monitoring software has beencompletely rewritten and integrated into the ATLAS common object-oriented C++ based ATHENA framework.

The goal of using the ATHENA framework in beam tests is to make the developed software for calibration, monitoring and analysis directly available for the future use in ATLAS. The software and data formats of the different sub-detectors are standardized and thus can be easily combined.

The EMEC/HEC combined beam test is the first use of ATHENA for beam test analysis, and the expertise gained in this effort is being carried forward into upcoming beam tests and offline analysis [39].

#### The ATHENA Framework

ATHENA is a fully object oriented framework based on the programming language C++ for the integration of all data processing steps concerning ATLAS [56]. It is currently being developed by the ATLAS collaboration and is designed to cover simulation, calibration and reconstruction of a high energy physics experiment. ATHENA allows a consistent treatment of data from different sub-systems of a detector.

The ATHENA framework itself is based on the experiment independent GAUDI framework [57], initially developed for the LHCb experiment. The development of GAUDI is much inspired by the experience that high energy physics experiments are expected to run for many years and it is much likely that underlying technologies, such as storage technologies, may change. Therefore GAUDI avoids every direct dependency on extern technologies and introduces a layer of abstraction between them and GAUDI applications. Concrete external software is then integrated into a GAUDI application by the so called jobOptions mechanism. In a simple text file, the jobOptions file, the algorithms that shall be executed are called and the corresponding libraries are loaded at run-time.

To minimize the coupling between different algorithms a Transient Data Store TDS is used. One algorithm produces new data objects in the data store whereas other algorithms use these data objects as input [57].

#### Structure of the Beam Test Algorithms

Figure 6.1 shows a block diagram of the used ATHENA based reconstruction software. It consists of the four packages LArHECTBChv, LArHECTBPed, LArHECTB Mon and LArHECTBAna:

The LArHECTBChv package reads the raw beam test data in the EPIO data format from the CERN central data storage, converts them into the various data classes that are provided by the LArTBEvent and LArRawEvent packages, like LArDigits for the signal time samples, and puts these into the Transient Data Store TDS.

The package LArHECTBPed retrieves the time sample objects from the TDS and calculates the run pedestal. The LArHECTBMon package is used for the online monitoring during the beam test.

The main part of the signal reconstruction is implemented in the LArHECTBAna package. It consists of algorithms for the reconstruction of the signal amplitude and timing, and the production of output n-tuples and histograms. Out of the various possibilities for timing (e.g. using the TDC or the global cubic time) and signal reconstruction (e.g. cubic interpolation and digital filtering), see chapter 4, the used algorithms are chosen via the jobOptions file. In this file the actual sets of constants like calibration coefficients to convert the ADC counts into currents and the digital filter weights are chosen also.

Although the LArHECTBAna package provides a possibility to fill histograms for beam test analysis, this functionality is not used to develop the analysis techniques. Instead the reconstructed signals are written event by event into an n-tuple in the ROOT format [59] for further analysis.

#### Output n-tuple

For each event the following output quantities of the ATHENA algorithms are stored in a ROOT n-tuple:

* event number

Figure 6.1: The reconstruction of the beam test data within the ATHENA framework [58]. From the raw data in the EPIO format the ionization signals and particle tracks are computed and put out as ROOT n-tuples for further analysis.

## Chapter 6 Offline Reconstruction

* trigger scintillator response
* global cubic time with standard deviation and number of channels from which the global cubic time was computed
* TDC information
* signal in nA and signal time in ns for each EMEC and HEC read-out channel
* background and background time for each HEC channel (optimal filter applied on the first five time samples)
* results of the track fit to the MWPC data.

Moreover for each run processed the run number, the run pedestal RMS in AD C counts for all channels, the beam energy and beam settings and the cryostat and y-table positions are stored.

#### Sub-Detector out of Phase Problems

In about 25% of all runs taken in the 2002 beam tests the data of the sub-detectors EMEC, HEC, MWPCs, TDC and scintillation counters are out of phase for parts of the run.

The reason of this problem could be traced back to the different read-out hardware of the sub-detectors, which did not support a common hardware event tag, see chapter 3. To prevent phase shifts between the sub-detectors if one sub-detector was not triggered or the data read-out failed, the DAQ system counted the events in one SPS spill and discarded the whole spill (usually about 300 events), when the sub-detectors recorded a different number of events during the spill.

The behavior of the different DAQ sub-systems to beam triggers between the "End of Burst" signal and the data transfer to the Event Builder program was not well understood. It happened that one sub-detector accepted trigger signals and did not send the corresponding data to the Event Builder program. Instead the data were stored in the first place of the storage pipeline and read out together with the events of the next spill [36]. This resulted in a phase shift of one event amongst the different sub-detector data. Each additional such event incremented the phase shift by one.

Figure 6.2 shows the sum of the total reconstructed energies in all EMEC and HEC clusters on the electromagnetic scale (see chapters 8 and 9) versus the event number for a 120 GeV pion run (run number 13143) without correction of the sub-detector out of phase problem. Up to event number 4649 the EMEC and HEC data are in phase and the reconstructed energy lies in a narrow band between 70 GeV and 110 GeV. Thereafter the EMEC and HEC data are out of phase and the reconstructed energy is randomly distributed between zero and about 200 GeV, while the mean of the reconstructed energy stays the same.

Also visible are empty events (4650-4732), (6172-6457) and (7899-8198), where the Event Builder program discarded a whole spill. After the first discarded spill the EMEC and HEC data are out of phase.

The out of phase problem can be solved during the offline reconstruction in ATHENA by comparing the individual event count numbers of the different sub-detectors and puttingthem into phase [60]. In the current implementation event shifts of up to 20 events can be corrected for and the EMEC, HEC and TDC are put into phase.

### 6.2 Event Reconstruction with the TBClusters Package

In the TBClusters software package all neighboring cells in one EMEC or HEC layer that contain a sizeable signal are combined to two dimensional clusters. The clusters are characterized by:

* the sum of the ionization currents of all cells in the cluster, for the energy reconstruction
* the cluster volume, together with the total ionization current, an input to distinguish electromagnetic from hadronic energy deposits and for weighting techniques, see chapter 9
* the barycenters of the clusters, for the impact position reconstruction.

Figure 6.2: Uncorrected sum of the total reconstructed energies in all EMEC and HEC clusters on the electromagnetic scale (see chapters 8 and 9) versus the event number for a 1 20 GeV pion run (run number 13143) without correction of the sub-detector out of phase problem. Up to event number 4649 the EMEC and HEC data are in phase, thereafter EMEC and HEC are out of phase, and the reconstructed energy is randomly distributed between zero and about double the beam energy. Also visible are discarded SPS spills, events (4650-4732), (6172-6457) and (7899-8198).

#### Input of Data and MC Simulations

The TBClusters package uses either the ATHENA output ROOT n-tuples for data or ROOT n-tuples from the MC simulations as input.

In the data n-tuples the cell signals are given as ionization currents in nA, whereas the MC simulations provide information about the visible energy in the EMEC and HEC read-out channels in units of energy, see chapter 5. From the visible energy, \(E_{\rm vis}^{\rm MC}\), a prediction for the ionization current, \(I^{\rm MC}\), is derived:

\[I^{\rm MC}=\frac{\alpha_{\rm MC}^{\rm EM}}{\alpha^{\rm EM}}E_{\rm vis}^{\rm MC }\, \tag{6.1}\]

where \(\alpha_{\rm MC}^{\rm EM}\) is the proportionality factor between the deposited and the visible energy in the MC simulations for electromagnetic showers, see equation (5.1), and \(\alpha^{\rm EM}\) is the proportionality factor between the observed ionization current and the deposited energy for an electromagnetic shower, see equation (8.3). The above relation between the visible energy and the predicted ionization current is also valid for hadronic showers.

The following electromagnetic scale constants for the EMEC and HEC are used:

\[\alpha_{\rm EMEC}^{\rm EM}=3.905\cdot 10^{-4}\frac{\rm GeV}{\rm nA}\quad\mbox{ and}\quad\alpha_{\rm HEC}^{\rm EM}=3.266\cdot 10^{-3}\frac{\rm GeV}{\rm nA}\, \tag{6.2}\]

where \(\alpha_{\rm EMEC}^{\rm EM}\) differs only marginal form the determined value of \(3.855\cdot 10^{-4}\frac{\rm GeV}{\rm nA}\) found in the electron data, see chapter 8, and \(\alpha_{\rm HEC}^{\rm EM}\) was taken from the 2000 beam tests, see chapter 9, because it could not be directly determined in the combined EMEC/HEC beam test.

#### Evaluation of the Noise and Generation of Noise for MC Simulations

For the clustering the signal to noise ratio of the individual channels is a quantity of high importance. The noise standard deviation, \(\sigma_{\rm noise,i}\), of channel \(i\) is set to be the corresponding pedestal RMS, \(\sigma_{\rm pedestal,i}\), times the noise reduction factor \(r\) of the optimal filter:

\[\sigma_{\rm noise,i}=r\,\cdot\sigma_{\rm pedestal,i}. \tag{6.3}\]

Average noise reduction factors of \(r=0.72\) (0.64) for the EMEC (HEC) are used, see section 4.5.

To compare the MC simulations with the data, random electronics noise has been added to the MC prediction of the ionization currents before applying the cluster algorithm. Therefore the observed pedestal RMS of the data run 12283, a 120 GeV pion run, is used:

\[I_{\rm with\ noise,i}^{\rm MC}=I_{\rm without\ noise,i}^{\rm MC}+r\,\cdot \sigma_{\rm pedestal,i}^{1283}\cdot\mathcal{N}(0,1)\, \tag{6.4}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:72]

Starting from the seed the cluster is iteratively expanded by adding all cells which are topological neighbors of cells that are already contained in the cluster and have an absolute signal to noise ratio of more than three:

\[|E_{\mathrm{neighbor}}|>3\sigma_{\mathrm{noise}}\, \tag{6.8}\]

thus the cluster is only expanded if the outermost cells have an absolute signal to noise ratio above three. If one cell is contained in two clusters these two clusters are merged to one cluster.

Figure 6.4: Approximate volumes of the HEC read-out channels.

Figure 6.3: Approximate volumes of the EMEC read-out channels.

## Chapter 6 Offline Reconstruction

A cell can only be included in a cluster if its absolute signal is above two times the noise standard deviation as a general cell cutoff:

\[|E_{\rm cell}|>\,2\sigma_{\rm noise}. \tag{6.9}\]

The neighbor and cell cuts have been chosen to be symmetric in order not to be biased towards positive noise fluctuations. The cut values for the seed and the cell cutoff are chosen similar to the values used in the calibration of the H1 liquid argon calorimeter [62].

Figure 6.5 shows for a typical event of a 120 GeV pion run all read-out cells of the E MEC and HEC together with the read-out cells that belong to the clusters. In total there are three clusters in the EMEC layers two and three, which contain 27, 19 and a single read-out cell. There are three clusters in the HEC layers one, two and three, which contain six, six and five cells.

#### Output of the TBClusters package

For each event the following output quantities are stored as a ROOT n-tuple:

* event number
* global cubic time with standard deviation in ns and number of channels from which the global cubic time was computed
* beam track parameters from the MWPCs
* cluster sums of the signals in nA and volumes in cm\({}^{3}\)
* total signal in nA in each EMEC and HEC layer
* total detector leakage in GeV for MC simulations
* linearly and logarithmically energy weighted barycenters for all clusters
* cluster noise in nA
* ionization signal in nA for each EMEC and HEC read-out channel, that is contained in a cluster.

The barycenters of the clusters are calculated as weighted averages from the geometric centers of the cluster cells in the ATLAS coordinate system, \(\vec{x_{i}}\), using the cell energies \(E_{i}\) or the logarithm of the cell energies as weights. The linear weighted barycenters, \(\vec{x_{\rm linear}}\), are given by:

\[\vec{x_{\rm linear}}=\frac{\sum_{i}E_{i}\vec{x_{i}}}{\sum_{i}E_{i}}\, \tag{6.10}\]where the sum runs over all cluster cells. The logarithmically weighted barycenters, \(\vec{x}_{\rm log}\), are given by [63]:

\[\vec{x}_{\rm log} = \frac{\sum_{i}w_{i}\vec{x}_{i}}{\sum_{i}w_{i}}\,\qquad w_{i}\,= \max\{0;\ 4.7+\log E_{i}\,\}\, \tag{6.11}\]

where the sum runs over all cluster cells with a positive weight \(w_{i}\). The offset of 4.7 in the weight has been tuned to give the best position resolution [64]. One purpose of the offset is to ignore low energy hits, which are far from the true impact location.

The total noise standard deviation \(\sigma_{\rm noise}^{\rm cluster}\) of the cluster is taken to be the quadratic sum of the noise standard deviations of the cluster cells \(i\):

\[\left(\sigma_{\rm noise}^{\rm cluster}\right)^{2} = \sum_{i}\sigma_{\rm noise,i}^{2}. \tag{6.12}\]

The noise of different cells is uncorrelated, as has been checked by comparing the calculated cluster noise, \(\sigma_{\rm noise}^{\rm cluster}\), with the standard deviation of the distribution of the total cluster signal of the same cluster for a muon run at a different impact point, neglecting the directly hit cells.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:76]

## Chapter 7 Alignment of the Modules and High Voltage Corrections

In the beam test setup the relative positions of the presampler, EMEC, HEC1 and HEC2 modules follow the ATLAS setup as closely as mechanically possible within the given tolerances. To be able to simulate details of the shower development and cluster reconstruction using the MC technique, see chapter 5, the precise horizontal and vertical positions of the calorimeter modules relative to each other and relative to the other objects in the beam line, like the cryostat, the scintillation counters and MWPCs, have to be determined.

As there are no direct position measurements of the calorimeter modules available, the relative positions have been derived from the data. Therefore the calorimeter response is correlated with the impact position of the incoming particles, reconstructed from the MWPC signals, and prominent features of the calorimeter structure like read-out cell or calorimeter module boundaries are made visible.

Comparing the calorimeter response for different impact positions, a weaker response of individual HEC modules has been observed. This can be traced back to two different kinds of high voltage problems, one of which has been documented during the beam test and a second one has been deduced from the calorimeter response in comparison to detailed MC simulations.

The influence of the high voltage problems on the response of the HEC has been corrected for in order to reconstruct the true energy of the incoming particle. The correction is derived from the data, no input from the MC simulations is used to correct the data. The developed algorithms are also applicable in the future ATLAS experiment to detect and correct eventual high voltage problems.

### 7.1 Alignment of the Calorimeter Modules

Using the track reconstruction based on the MWPC data, the signal response in the EMEC, HEC1 and HEC2 modules can be closely followed in horizontal and vertical scans with muons and pions. As electron showers are nearly fully contained in the EMEC no dedicated electron scans have been taken for alignment studies. The general goal is toreconstruct the positions of the cell and module boundaries in the presampler, EMEC, HEC1 and HEC2 modules relative to the MWPC positions, which define the coordinate system of the beam test. The absolute positions of the MWPCs with respect to each other and with respect to the other parts of the beam line like the cryostat are also not known exactly. For the relative alignment of the MWPC positions a rather heuristic procedure was applied by requiring the fit residua of the particle track in the MWPCs to be minimal.

The measured coordinates of the calorimeters, \(\vec{x}_{\mathrm{real}}\), are then compared to the nominal coordinates of the calorimeter modules, \(\vec{x}_{\mathrm{nom}}\), see equation (3.1). The difference between the nominal and the actual position, the offsets \(\vec{x}_{\mathrm{offset}}\), are then used as input for the placement of the calorimeters in the MC simulations:

\[\vec{x}_{\mathrm{nom}}=\vec{x}_{\mathrm{real}}+\vec{x}_{\mathrm{offset}}. \tag{7.1}\]

Thereby only translations of the calorimeter modules are taken into account and no tilts nor rotations. As the beam enters the calorimeter modules nearly parallel to the z-direction, no position information of the calorimeter modules in the z-direction can be obtained.

#### Alignment using Muon Scans

For the alignment of the EMEC and HEC modules horizontal and vertical scans are used:

* horizontal scans at \(y=0\) with positive muons of 120 GeV in the range \(-8\) cm \(\leq x\leq 8\) cm and negative muons of 150 GeV in the range \(-26\) cm \(\leq x\leq-15\) cm
* vertical scans at \(x=7\) cm with negative muons of 150 GeV in the range \(-18\) cm \(\leq y\leq\) 10 cm.

The muon signals have been reconstructed using the optimal filter with the time input from the TDC, see chapter 4. For a further analysis of the muon data, see chapter 10. Due to a high pion background that overwhelmed the seperate trigger of the MWPCs, for only about 10 % of the muons the track has been measured by the MWPCs [65]. This limits the statistical accuracy of the position determination of the calorimeter modules.

Muons in this energy range loose energy in the calorimeter mainly due to ionization, see chapters 2 and 10, in a narrow region around their flight path and penetrate the whole calorimeter. Therefore muons are a good probe to test the dependence of the calorimeter response on its local structure in the full depth of the calorimeter.

As muons usually only deposit a sizeable signal in the read-out channel which is directly hit by the muon, the crossover position of the muon beam from one read-out channel to the neighboring one can easily be determined by comparing the signal difference in two neighboring channels as a function of the impact position of the muon. The boundary is reached, where the signal in both channels is the same and thus the signal difference vanishes.

As an example in figure 7.1 for a vertical scan with 150 GeV muons the difference in the average signal response in the channels 41 and 25 in the first longitudinal layer of the HEC1 is shown as a function of the extrapolated impact point from the MWPCs to the center of the first HEC1 read-out layer. At the boundary between the two read-out channels both channels have the same signal. Therefore the signal difference vanishes. A linear fit to the signal difference in the transition region yields \(y_{\mathrm{real}}=(2.83\pm 0.05)\) cm, where the quoted error is purely statistical. In nominal coordinates the cell boundary would be expected at \(y_{\mathrm{nom}}=5.3\) cm, so the y-offset of the HEC1 is \(y_{\mathrm{offset}}=(2.47\pm 0.05)\) cm.

The resolution of the position determination of the cell and module boundaries with muons depends on the position resolution of the MWPCs and on the multiple scattering of the muons in the calorimeter material. Moreover the extrapolation of the muon track from the MWPCs to the center of the read-out layer, the disregard of possible rotations and tilts of the calorimeter modules and differences in response in the read-out cells introduce systematic errors.

To determine the read-out cell boundaries with the above described method, the muon beam has to enter the calorimeter parallel to the longitudinal interface between the two neighboring read-out cells. Due to the pseudo-pointing structure of the HEC, see figure 1.7, this requirement if fulfilled and the read-out cell boundaries in the x- and y-direction can be determined. The EMEC is designed to be pointing in the ATLAS setup, whereas it is non-pointing in the beam test. Only its radial structures, \(\phi=\mathrm{const}\), are parallel to the beam while the tangential structures, \(\eta=\mathrm{const}\), are tilted with respect to the beam, see figure 7.2. So the positions of the read-out cell boundaries can only be determined in the x-direction close to \(x=0\) cm (\(x\sim\phi\) for small \(x\)). As the presampler only consists of a single liquid argon read-out gap, its response to muons is marginal and is not used to

extract the cell positions in the presampler.

#### Alignment using Pion Scans

The alignment parameters of the presampler, EMEC, HE C1 and HE C2 modules are obtained from the calorimeter response to horizontal and vertical pion scans:

* horizontal scans at \(y=0\) with positive pions of 150 GeV and negative pions of 30 and 200 GeV in the range \(-2\,6\) cm \(\leq x\leq 2\,6\) cm
* vertical scans with negative pions at \(y=0\) with energies of 30 and 200 GeV at \(x=6\) cm in the range \(-18\) cm \(\leq y\leq 18\) cm (30 GeV) and \(-8\) cm \(\leq y\leq 14\) cm (200 GeV).

The pion signals have been reconstructed using the optimal filter together with the global cubic event timing, see chapter 4. For further analysis of the pion data, see chapter 9.

In contrast to muons pions initiate a hadronic shower in the calorimeter and the energy is deposited in a larger number of read-out cells. For the reconstruction of the shower the cluster algorithm, see chapter 6, has been used.

To extract the positions of the read-out cells the ratio between the highest energetic cell in a cluster and the total cluster signal is correlated with the particle impact position, given by an extrapolation from the MWPC information to the center of the considered calorimeter layer. The ratio between the signal of the highest energetic cell in a cluster and the total cluster signal is on average maximal if the shower axis lies in the center of a read-out cell and minimal if the shower axis lies on the boundary between two read-out cells. On average the shower axis coincides with the direction of the incoming particle.

Figure 7.2: Schematics of the geometry of the EMEC read-out channels in the \(\eta-z\) plane. All cell boundaries of the EMEC point to the future ATLAS interaction point, but not to the incoming particles in the beam tests. The beam penetrates several read-out cells, so no cell boundaries in the \(\eta\)-direction (y-direction for small \(x\)) can be observed.

As an example figure 7.3 shows the ratios between the energies of the most energetic cell in HEC layer 1 and the total cluster energy as a function of the extrapolated impact position of the pions at the center of HEC layer 1 for the vertical scan with 200 GeV pions. The pad boundary is located, where the ratio is minimal. A parabolic fit to the minimum yields \(x_{\mathrm{real}}=(2.46\pm 0.05)\) cm, where the error is purely statistical. Compared to the nominal position of the cell boundary, \(y_{\mathrm{nom}}=5.3\) cm, this results in a y-offset of the HEC1 of \(y_{\mathrm{offset}}(\mathrm{pions})=(2.84\pm 0.05)\) cm. The determined y-offset differs from the value of \(y_{\mathrm{offset}}(\mathrm{muons})=(2.47\pm 0.05)\) cm from the muons, see section 7.1.1. The difference can be attributed to a different longitudinal development of the ionization signal of muons and pion showers. Moreover there might be a systematic error due to possible calorimeter rotations.

This method works best for large read-out cells with longitudinal boundaries parallel to the incoming particle, so for the HEC the read-out cell boundaries in the x- and y-direction can be determined, while for the EMEC the positions of the pad boundaries can only be determined in the x-direction close to \(x=0\) cm. Although the presampler contains on average only a small signal, its cell boundaries can also be determined in both x- and y-directions.

The y-position of the EMEC has been determined by comparing the reconstructed impact positions from the clusters in nominal coordinates, see section 6.2.5, as seen in the data with the reconstructed impact positions of the MC simulations. The difference between the data and the MC simulations is then taken to be the physical shift of the EMEC [60].

Figure 7.3: Vertical scan with 200 GeV pions: Ratio between the energies of the most energetic cell in HEC layer 1 and the total cluster energy as a function of the extrapolated impact position of the pions at the center of HEC layer 1. The pad boundary is located, where the ratio is minimal. The black curve represents a parabolic fit to the minimum, see text.

#### Alignment Summary

The positions of various read-out cell boundaries in the different longitudinal layers of the calorimeter modules are determined with different systematics from the muon and pion data. The resulting calorimeter positions agree with each other within \(\pm 2\) mm [60].

In all, the EMEC and HEC are precisely aligned with respect to each other, both have a common y-offset of about 2.7 cm, which is probably due to the thickness of the support frame. The x-offset of the EMEC and HEC modules is compatible with zero. In table 7.1 the effective offsets of the calorimeter modules with respect to their nominal positions used as input for the MC simulations are summarized.

### 7.2 HV Problems

In the beam test two different types of high voltage problems occurred. Due to a short circuit one high voltage line had to be disconnected which resulted in no signal in one of the four sub-gaps of each liquid argon gap of a whole read-out layer in one HEC module. On the other hand, particular high voltage gaps apparently did not produce any signal.

#### Disconnection of one HV Line

In the second longitudinal segment of the central HEC1 module just before run number 1 3061 one of the 4 HV lines, which are feeding the sub-gaps of this section, see figure 1.8, had to be disconnected because of a short circuit. So only three out of four sub-gaps contributed to the calorimeter signal in this section. Thus the measured signal has to be corrected by a factor of 4/3.

As the shower particles are still measured in the three remaining sub-gaps correctly, all fluctuations of the hadronic shower are determined accurately and the intrinsic resolution of the calorimeter is only minimally deteriorated. The main consequence of the disconnection of one high voltage line is an increase in the electronics noise by a factor of 4/3, taken into account in the determination of the cluster noise according to equation (6.12).

#### Single HV Gap Failures

The horizontal scans with pions revealed that the signal response in some HEC modules is weaker than the response in the other modules in the same read-out layer. Moreover

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}  & x-offset & y-offset \\ \hline Presampler & +1.30 cm & +1.45 cm \\ EMEC & 0 cm & +2.75 cm \\ HEC1 & 0 cm & +2.75 cm \\ HEC2 & 0 cm & +2.75 cm \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 7.1: The used offsets of the positions of the calorimeter modules with respect to their nominal positions in the MC simulations [66, 67]. The offsets are obtained with a precision of typically \(\pm 2\) mm.

the difference in the response was observed to depend on the longitudinal development of the shower.

##### HV Gap Failure in the Second HEC Layer

Figure 7.4 shows the energy response for 200 GeV pions in the clusters in the second HEC read-out layer, normalized to the average response in the outer modules, versus the impact position in the x-direction for "early" and "late" showers. For pions that started early showering (no clusters in HEC layer 3, red points), the response of the center module is weaker by more than 10% than in the outer modules, whereas for late showers (no clusters in the EMEC and in the HEC layer 1, blue points) no difference in response between the center and the outer modules can be detected.

The smaller response for early showers, but not for late showers, indicates that the missing signal is due to a localized problem in the front part of the read-out layer. As a hypothesis it was assumed that one whole liquid argon gap in the corresponding module did not contribute to the signal. To validate this hypothesis, dedicated MC simulations have been prepared that allowed to artificially turn off the signal from any of the liquid argon gaps.

Figure 7.5 shows for 200 GeV pions the ratio between the average energy deposit in the center module of the HEC layer 2 and the average energy deposit in the outer modules of the HEC layer 2 as a fuction of the asymmetry of the total energy deposits in the first and third (last) longitudinal HEC read-out layer. The data (black stars) are well reproduced by a GEANT4 QGSP MC simulation (blue histogram), in which the signal contribution from the first liquid argon gap in the corresponding module has been turned off. The

Figure 7.4: Energy response of the HEC layer 2 for 200 GeV pions, normalized to the average response in the outer modules, versus the impact position for early and late showers (no energy deposit after or before HEC layer 2, respectively). For late showers the response is uniform, whereas for early showers the response in the center module is smaller by about 10%. Also visible are the module boundaries between the three HEC modules at \(x\approx\pm 16\) cm as minima in the calorimeter response.

result of the MC simulation is nearly independent on the accuracy of the description of the longitudinal shower development as this only influences the relative population of the "early" and "late" showers, but not the response for a given longitudinal shower center.

After the run this problem could be partially traced back to a bad ground connections of the EST boards in the corresponding region of the central HEC1 module [39].

The dependence of the response on the longitudinal shower position, given by the asymmetry of the energy deposits in the HEC layers 1 and 3, is fitted by a cubic polynomial (black line in figure 7.5):

\[\frac{E_{\mathrm{0}\,bserved}}{E_{\mathrm{expected}}}=9.28\cdot 10^{-1}-1.77 \cdot 10^{-2}\cdot R_{2}-5.97\cdot 10^{-2}\cdot R_{2}^{3}\, \tag{7.2}\]

where \(E_{\mathrm{0}\,bserved}\) is the observed energy in the center module of HEC layer 2 and \(E_{\mathrm{expected}}\) is the expected energy, as given by the average signal in the outer modules of HEC layer 2. A term proportional to \(R_{2}^{2}\) has not been included, as its coefficient is compatible with zero. \(R_{2}\) is the asymmetry of the total energy deposits in the first and third longitudinal HEC layer, defined as:

\[R_{2}=\frac{E_{\mathrm{HEC1}}-E_{\mathrm{HEC3}}}{E_{\mathrm{HEC1}}+E_{\mathrm{ HEC3}}}\, \tag{7.3}\]

Figure 7.5: Ratio between the average energy deposit of 200 GeV pions in the center module of the HEC layer 2 and the average energy deposit in the outer modules of the HEC layer 2 as a fuction of the asymmetry of the total energy deposits in the first and third (last) longitudinal HEC read-out layer. The data (black stars) are well reproduced by a GEANT4 QGSP MC simulation (blue histogram), in which the signal contribution from the first liquid argon gap in the corresponding module has been turned off. The black line shows a fit to the data points with a cubic polynomial (see text).

where \(E_{\rm HE\,C1}\) and \(E_{\rm HE\,C3}\) are the total reconstructed cluster energies on the electromagnetic scale, see chapter 9, in the first and in the third HEC layer, respectively.

The above relation (7.2) is then used to correct for the problem: First the cluster energies in the HEC layers 1 and 3 are determined on the electromagnetic scale together with the asymmetry measure \(R_{2}\). Thereafter the signals \(E_{i}\) of the read-out cells in the affected module are multiplied by the determined correction factor:

\[E_{i,\;{\rm corrected}}=\frac{E_{i}}{9.28\cdot 10^{-1}-1.77\cdot 10^{-2}\cdot R _{2}-5.97\cdot 10^{-2}\cdot R_{2}^{3}}\, \tag{7.4}\]

the cell noise values are multiplied by the same factor as input for the total cluster noise according to equation (6.12). The rare case that there is only a cluster in the second HEC layer is treated according to the "late" shower case and no correction factor is applied.

Figure 7.6 shows the energy response of the HEC layer 2 for 200 GeV pions before and after the applied corrections (red and blue points, respectively), normalized to the average response in the outer modules before the correction, versus the impact position. After the correction the uniformity of the response is nearly fully recovered.

The analysis of the high voltage problem has been repeated and confirmed for pions of 30 and 150 GeV and the correction has been found to be rather energy independent. So the above correction is used for pions of all energies.

Figure 7.7 shows the total reconstructed energy on the electromagnetic scale for 200 GeV pions at the impact position of \(x=-10\) cm and \(y=0\) cm before and after the HV correction. The correction of the high voltage problem on an event-by-event basis takes

Figure 7.6: Energy response of the HEC layer 2 for 200 GeV pions before and after the applied corrections (red and blue points, respectively), normalized to the average response in the outer modules before the correction, versus the impact position. The response after correction shows a good uniformity.

to a large extent care of shower fluctuations and thus does not only increase the average reconstructed signal. It also recovers the energy resolution \(\sigma(E)/E\) from \(8.97\pm 0.12\) % in case of the HV problem to \(8.61\pm 0.12\) % after the correction. Contrary to that the energy resolution can not be recovered by a constant HV correction factor, \(E_{i,\;\mathrm{corrected}}=\mathrm{const}\cdot E_{i}\).

To sum up, the data have been used directly to correct for the observed high voltage problem without any further MC assumptions.

#### Potential HV Gap failure in the First HEC Layer

In the first HEC read-out layer a weaker response of the left HEC1 module (seen in the beam direction), compared to the other two modules, has been observed in the horizontal pion scans.

Figure 7.8 shows the energy response in the clusters in the first HEC read-out layer, normalized to the average response in the center module, versus the impact position in the x-direction. The response in the left module is reduced by about 5% compared to the center module. As also the response in the right module is somewhat smaller than in the center module the smaller response can partially be due to a higher energy leakage out of the calorimeter for the outer modules.

Following the analysis of the high voltage problem in the HEC layer 2, the ratio between the response in the left module and the center module of the HEC layer 1 has been determined as a fuction of the longitudinal shower development, given by the asymmetry of the energy deposits in the EMEC and in the second HEC layer, see figure 7.9. The data (black stars) agree within errors with the results of a GEANT4 Q

Figure 7.7: Total reconstructed energy on the electromagnetic scale for 200 GeV pions at the impact position of \(x=-10\) cm and \(y=0\) cm before (red histogram) and after (blue histogram) the HV correction, shown together with Gaussian fits to the signal peak (red and blue lines). The correction recovers the resolution \(\sigma(E)/E\) from \(8.97\pm 0.12\) % to \(8.61\pm 0.12\) %.

histogram), in which the signal contribution of one of the four sub-gaps of the first and the third liquid argon gaps in the left HEC layer 1 module has been turned off.

The dependence of the response on the longitudinal shower position, given by the asymmetry of the energy deposits in the EMEC and in the HEC layer 2, is fitted by a cubic polynomial (black line in figure 7.9):

\[\frac{E_{\mathrm{o\,bserved}}}{E_{\mathrm{expected}}}=9.38\cdot 10^{-1}-1.9\cdot 1 0^{-3}\cdot R_{1}-3.0\cdot 10^{-3}\cdot R_{1}^{2}-2.40\cdot 10^{-2}\cdot R_{1}^{3}\, \tag{7.5}\]

where \(E_{\mathrm{o\,bserved}}\) is the observed energy in the left module of HEC layer 1 and \(E_{\mathrm{expected}}\) is the expected energy, as given by the average signal in the center module of HEC layer 1. \(R_{1}\) is the asymmetry of the total energy deposits in the EMEC and in the second longitudinal HEC layer, defined as:

\[R_{1}=\frac{E_{\mathrm{EMEC}}-E_{\mathrm{HEC2}}}{E_{\mathrm{EMEC}}+E_{\mathrm{ HEC2}}}\, \tag{7.6}\]

where \(E_{\mathrm{EMEC}}\) and \(E_{\mathrm{HEC2}}\) are the total reconstructed cluster energies on the electromagnetic scale, see chapters 8 and 9, in the EMEC and in the second HEC layer (no HV corrections applied), respectively.

The dependence of the energy response ratio between the left and the center module of HEC layer 1 is not as pronounced as in the case of the single HV gap failure in the second HEC layer. The smaller response in the first HEC layer can either be due to the

Figure 7.8: Energy response of the HEC layer 1 for 200 GeV pions, normalized to the average response in the center module, versus the impact position. The response of the left module is smaller by about 5% compared to the center module. Clearly visible are the module boundaries between the three HEC modules at \(x\approx\pm 16\) cm.

combination of leakage outside the calorimeter and a possible not optimal calibration of the affected read-out channels or due to the failure of two read-out sub-gaps in the front part of the left module.

However, equation 7.5 has been used to correct for the smaller response in the left module of the first HEC layer in an analogues way as for the single HV gap failure in the second HEC layer.

The data (black stars) can be reproduced by a GEANT4 QGSP MC simulation (red histogram), in which the signal contribution from one sub-gap of the first and third HV gap in the corresponding module has been turned off. The black line shows a fit to the data points with a cubic polynomial (see text).

## Chapter 8 Performance for Electrons

In order to study the performance of the Electromagnetic End-cap Calorimeter (EMEC) for electrons, it has been exposed to electron and positron beams of energies between 6 and 148 GeV at 9 selected impact points, see figure 3.11. In addition, a more detailed study of the uniformity of the EMEC has been carried out with 119 GeV positron beams at the 9 standard impact points and 8 surrounding points each, see figure 3.10.

This chapter covers:

* the reconstruction of the total calorimeter signal
* the applied corrections for the dependence of the total calorimeter signal on timing and particle impact position
* the determination of the electromagnetic scale factor and its constancy for different impact energies and positions
* the electron energy resolution and its dependence on the energy of the impact particle and the reconstructed impact position
* the position reconstruction for electrons.

First the total calorimeter signal is reconstructed from the sum of all cluster ionization signals in the EMEC under the requirement that there are no clusters in the HEC to suppress the pion background.

The total reconstructed calorimeter signal is observed to depend on the relative timing between the particle impact and the read-out clock, see section 4.2. Furthermore the calorimeter response depends on the reconstructed particle impact position due to the accordion structure of the absorbers and liquid argon gaps.

After corrections for the time and position dependence of the calorimeter signal the electromagnetic scale factor, \(\alpha_{\mathrm{EMEC}}^{\mathrm{EM}}\), which translates the ionization current in nA to the deposited energy in GeV, is extracted and the constancy of the electromagnetic scale factor for different energies of the impact particles and for different impact positions is examined.

## Chapter 8 Performance for Electrons

### 8.1 Reconstruction of the Total Calorimeter Signal

The readout-out cell signals are reconstructed using the optimal filtering method together with the global cubic event timing, see chapter 4. The signal cells are grouped in clusters event by event using the TBClusters software package, see section 6.2, and used as input for all further analysis, whereas in the 2000 EMEC stand-alone beam test [6] a fixed size cluster around the impact position has been used. Due to the non-pointing structure of the EMEC in the 2002 combined beam test, see figure 7.2, the calorimeter signal is distributed over more cells than in the pointing ATLAS case and the relative signals of the cells depend on the longitudinal development of the shower event by event.

The reconstruction of the particle energy is based on the total calorimeter signal, given by the sum of the ionization currents in all clusters in the EMEC.

#### 8.1.1 Pion Rejection

As described in section 3.2, for energies up to 80 GeV electrons and pions are separated using a differential Cherenkov counter. For these energies the pion contribution is found to be fairly small, on the order of a few percent. For higher energies electrons are separated from pions by their synchrotron radiation energy loss in the magnetic field of a bending magnet. The relative pion contribution to the electron beam is at the level of up to 20%. The pions start showering later compared to electrons and deposit a sizeable amount of their energy in the HEC, whereas electron showers are nearly fully contained in the EMEC with a depth of about 26 radiation lengths. To reject the pions a cut on the longitudinal extend of the shower was imposed: It was demanded that there are no clusters in the HEC.

Figure 8.1 shows the total reconstructed ionization signal in the EMEC clusters for a 148 GeV electron run at the impact point I before (red histogram) and after (blue histogram) the cut against the pion contamination of the electron beam. The signal distribution before the cut has a pronounced peak and a long tail towards smaller energies. The cut rejects nearly all of the events in the low signal tail but only a few events in the signal peak. The distribution of the total calorimeter signal of the remaining electron events is fitted well by a Gaussian (black line) with a mean of \(I\approx 3.74\cdot 10^{5}\) nA and a standard deviation of \(\sigma(I)\approx 7.7\cdot 10^{3}\) nA. Thus the resolution \(\frac{\sigma(I)}{I}\) is about 2.0%.

The few remaining events of very low signals can be contributed to electronics noise in randomly triggered events and possibly to a muon content of the beam.

### 8.2 Corrections to the Total Calorimeter Signal

The reconstructed total ionization signal depends on the relative timing between the particle arrival and the read-out clock. Moreover due to the accordion shaped absorber and read-out gap geometry of the EMEC the total reconstructed calorimeter signal depends on the reconstructed impact position of the electron with respect to the absorber [6]. As the reconstruction of the particle energy is based on the total calorimeter signal, its dependence on timing and on the impact position has to be corrected for.

The geometry of the EMEC requires a variation of the high voltage with respect to \(\eta\) to achieve a constant electric field strength in the liquid argon gaps and thus a constant signal response. However, for technical reasons, a high voltage varying in steps has been chosen, such that in one HV sector the signal response of the calorimeter increases slightly with \(\eta\)[6]. The outer EMEC wheel is divided into seven high voltage sectors, two of which being in the ranges \(\eta\in[1.5;1.6]\) and \(\eta\in[1.6;1.8]\). This corresponds to the standard impact points C, D, E and F at the impact row at \(\eta\approx 1.65\) (in the first EMEC layer) and the standard impact points H, I, J and K at \(\eta\approx 1.55\), see figure 3.11. As the beam impact region of each run is quite small and all corrections and analysis steps are done run by run no corrections for a possible \(\eta\)-dependence of the reconstructed signal have been made.

#### Time Dependence of the Total Calorimeter Signal

The asynchronous trigger with respect to the 40 MHz read-out clock requires a parameterization of the optimal filter weights within the 25 ns window, see section 4.2. Due to a non-optimal modelling of the ionization signal shape in the EMEC, see section 3.6.3,

Figure 8.1: Distribution of the total reconstructed ionization signal in the EMEC clusters for a 148 GeV electron run at the impact point I before (red histogram) and after (blue histogram) the requirement of no clusters in the HEC. The signal distribution after the application of the cut is fitted well by a Gaussian (black line) with a mean of \(I\approx 3.74\cdot 10^{5}\) nA and a standard deviation of \(\sigma(I)\approx 7.7\cdot 10^{3}\) nA.

the reconstructed signal amplitude has a small residual dependence on the relative timing between the particle arrival and the read-out clock pulses and thus on the global cubic event time, see section 4.3.2.

Figure 8.2 shows the dependence of the total signal response, normalized to the average reconstructed signal of the corresponding data taking run, on the global cubic event time for 12 electron and positron runs in the energy range between 6 and 148 GeV at the impact point J. The variation of the energy response is at the level of \(\pm 1\,\%\) and has a period of 25 ns, the period of the read-out clock, as indicated by a sinusoidal fit with a 25 ns period around a relative response of one.

As in ATLAS the read-out clock is in phase with the beam interactions, the effect is not present there. To correct for the time dependence of the signal in the beam tests, a bin by bin correction to the total reconstructed ionization signal is applied:

\[I_{\mathrm{corr}}=I\left(t_{\mathrm{Global}}\right)-\left[\langle I(t_{1} \leq t_{\mathrm{Global}}<t_{2})\rangle_{\mathrm{run}}-\langle I\rangle_{ \mathrm{run}}\right]\, \tag{8.1}\]

where \(I_{\mathrm{corr}}\) is the corrected signal, \(I(t_{\mathrm{Global}})\) is the measured signal of the particular event with its global cubic event time \(t_{\mathrm{Global}}\), \(\langle I(t_{1}\leq t_{\mathrm{Global}}<t_{2})\rangle_{\mathrm{run}}\) is the average signal over the whole run for the corresponding time bin \(t_{1}\leq t_{\mathrm{Global}}<t_{2}\) of the global cubic time and \(\langle I\rangle_{\mathrm{run}}\) is the average signal of all events of the run.

No time structure of the calorimeter signal is simulated in the MC simulations, thus no timing corrections have to be applied.

Figure 8.2: Dependence of the reconstructed energy, normalized to the average reconstructed signal of the corresponding data taking run, on the global cubic event time for 12 electron and positron runs in the energy range between 6 and 148 GeV at the impact point J. The variation of the energy response is at the level of \(\pm 1\,\%\) and has a period of 25 ns, the period of the read-out clock, as indicated by a sinusoidal fit with a 25 ns period around a relative response of one.

#### Dependence of the Total Calorimeter Signal on the Reconstructed Impact Position

Because of the local non-uniformities of the electric field and the variation of the sampling fraction due to the accordion geometry, the reconstructed signal in the EMEC depends on the shower development relative to the absorbers and thus on the reconstructed beam impact position inside a cell in \(\phi\)[6], determined from the reconstructed barycenter of the cluster.

Figure 8.3 shows the dependence of the total reconstructed signal on the reconstructed impact position \(\phi\) for 119 GeV positrons at the standard impact points H, I and J plus 8 surrounding points each. The signal is normalized to the average reconstructed signal of the corresponding data taking run. The \(\phi\) position is reconstructed using linear weights from the highest energetic cluster in the second EMEC read-out layer and projected into one read-out cell of the EMEC layer 2. Clearly visible is the regular pattern of the three accordion shaped absorber plates with maxima at \(\phi_{\mathrm{norm}}\approx 0,\ \pm 1/3\), with \(\phi_{\mathrm{norm}}\equiv\phi+0.5\Delta\phi\pmod\Delta\phi\). \(\Delta\phi=\frac{2\pi}{256}\approx 0.025\) is the granularity of the EMEC read-out cells in the second EMEC layer in \(\phi\). \(\phi_{\mathrm{norm}}=0\) represents the center of the read-out cell. The relative peak to peak variation of the total reconstructed signal is at a level of about 3%.

The \(\phi\)-dependence of the total reconstructed signal has been corrected numerically bin by bin:

\[I_{\mathrm{corr}}=I(\phi_{\mathrm{norm}})-\left[\langle I(\phi_{1}\leq\phi_{ \mathrm{norm}}<\phi_{2})\rangle_{\mathrm{run}}-\langle I\rangle_{\mathrm{run} }\right]\, \tag{8.2}\]

Figure 8.3: Dependence of the total reconstructed signal, normalized to the average reconstructed signal of the corresponding run, for 119 GeV positrons at the standard impact points H, I and J plus 8 surrounding points each on the reconstructed impact position \(\phi\) from the highest energetic cluster in the second EMEC read-out layer using linear weights, projected into one read-out cell. Clearly visible is the regular structure from the three absorbers per read-out cell in the EMEC layer 2 with a relative peak to peak variation of the reconstructed signal of 3%.

where \(I_{\rm corr}\) is the corrected calorimeter signal, \(I(\phi_{\rm norm})\) is the measured signal of the particular event with its reconstructed \(\phi_{\rm norm}\) value from the highest energetic cluster in the second E MEC layer. \(\langle I(\phi_{1}\leq\phi_{\rm norm}<\phi_{2})\rangle_{\rm run}\) is the average signal over the whole run for the corresponding bin \(\phi_{1}\leq\phi_{\rm norm}<\phi_{2}\) and \(\langle I\rangle_{\rm run}\) is the average signal of all events of the run.

The observed good uniformity and regularity of the \(\phi\)-modulation of the reconstructed signal allows also its parameterization in terms of a Fourier series [6]. But as the beam test is non-pointing in comparison to the future pointing ATLAS setup the determined parameterization cannot directly be transfered to ATLAS.

In the MC simulations a similar \(\phi\)-dependence of the reconstructed signal has been observed and it is corrected in the same way as the data. Nevertheless there are differences in the position and the amplitude of the \(\phi\)-modulation of the reconstructed signal between the data and the two MC simulations and also amongst the MC simulations [68]. This problem is currently under investigation.

#### Influence of the Corrections on the Resolution

The corrections for the time and position dependence of the total reconstructed signal strongly enhance the resolution \(\frac{\sigma(I)}{I}\) of the reconstructed signal. Figure 8.4 shows for the same run as shown in figure 8.1 (148 GeV electrons at the impact point I) the signal distribution after the cut against pions (black histogram), see section 8.1.1, together with the signal distributions after the corrections for the signal dependence on the global cubic event time (red histogram) and after an additional correction for the dependence on the reconstructed \(\phi\) impact position (blue histogram). A Gaussian fit (blue line) to the signal distribution after all corrections results in a mean of \(I\approx 3.74\cdot 10^{5}\) nA and a standard deviation of \(\sigma(I)\approx 4.1\cdot 10^{3}\) nA. Thus the resolution of the reconstructed signal is enhanced by the corrections from about 2.0%, see section 8.1.1, to about 1.1%, while the mean reconstructed signal stays unaltered by the corrections.

### 8.3 Determination of the Electromagnetic Scale Factor

The electromagnetic scale factor, \(\alpha_{\rm EME\,C}^{\rm EM}\), allows the conversion of the observed ionization current \(I\) (measured in nA) to the deposited energy, \(E^{\rm depo}\), (measured in GeV) for an electromagnetic shower:

\[E^{\rm depo}[\rm GeV]=\alpha^{\rm EM}I[\rm nA]. \tag{8.3}\]

To obtain the electromagnetic scale, one has to take into account that there is also an energy deposit beyond the reconstructed cluster. As the MC simulations indicate that for electrons the energy leakage beyond the detector boundaries is negligible, the beam energy, \(E_{\rm beam}\), equals the energy deposit in the E MEC, \(E_{\rm EME\,C}^{\rm depo}\), plus a small contribution of energy leakage into the first HEC layer, \(E_{\rm HEC\,layer\,1}^{\rm depo}\)\[E_{\text{beam}}=E_{\text{EMEC}}^{\text{depo}}+E_{\text{HEC}\text{ layer 1}}^{\text{depo}}. \tag{8.4}\]

Relying on the fact that the electronics noise contribution to the ionization current is symmetric around zero and thus cancels on average, see section 4.5, equations (8.4) and (8.3) give together on average:

\[E_{\text{beam}}=\alpha_{\text{EMEC}}^{\text{EM}}I_{\text{EMEC}}^{\text{total}}+ \alpha_{\text{HEC}}^{\text{EM}}I_{\text{HEC layer 1}}^{\text{total}}\, \tag{8.5}\]

where \(\alpha_{\text{EMEC}}^{\text{EM}}\) is the sought electromagnetic scale factor for the EMEC, \(I^{\text{total}}\) is the total ionization signal of all EMEC channels regardless of the clusters, \(\alpha_{\text{HEC}}^{\text{EM}}\) is the electromagnetic scale factor for the HEC and \(I_{\text{HEC}\text{ layer 1}}^{\text{total}}\) is the total ionization current in the first HEC layer, with the usual requirement that there are no clusters in the HEC to suppress a pion contribution. The electromagnetic scale of the HEC cannot be determined directly in this beam test, so the result from previous HEC stand-alone beam tests, \(\alpha_{\text{HEC}}^{\text{EM}}=(3.266\pm 0.065)\frac{\text{MeV}}{\text{nA}}\)[7, 39], is used. For an indirect validation of the HEC electromagnetic scale factor see chapter 9.

The EMEC electromagnetic scale factor is obtained run by run as the average of the calculated electromagnetic scale according to equation (8.5) over all events of the run:

\[\alpha_{\text{EMEC}}^{\text{EM}}=\left\langle\frac{E_{\text{beam}}-\,\alpha_{ \text{HEC}}^{\text{EM}}I_{\text{HEC layer 1}}^{\text{total}}}{I_{\text{EMEC}}^{\text{total}}}\right\rangle_{\text{run}}\, \tag{8.6}\]

Figure 8.4: Distribution of the total reconstructed ionization signal in the EMEC clusters for a 148 GeV electron run at the impact point I, as shown in figure 8.1, after the cut against pions (black histogram), after the correction for the dependence on the cubic time (red histogram) and after the additional correction for the \(\phi\)-dependence (blue histogram), together with a Gaussian fit to the distribution after all corrections (blue line) with a mean of \(I\approx 3.74\cdot 10^{5}\) nA and a standard deviation of \(\sigma(I)\approx 4.1\cdot 10^{3}\) nA.

with a statistical error given by the standard deviation of the distribution of the \(\alpha^{\rm EM}_{\rm EME\,C}\) from the individual events of the run. The overall electromagnetic scale is then the weighted average of the \(\alpha^{\rm EM}_{\rm EME\,C}\) obtained for the various beam energies. The relative variation of the reconstructed signal by 3% with \(\phi\) introduces the need to define a reference \(\phi\) for the electromagnetic scale. Therefore the interval \(\phi_{\rm norm}\in[-0.5;-0.46]\), see figure 8.3, at the impact point I has been chosen. The reconstructed \(\phi_{\rm norm}\) values are equally distributed over the interval and the variation of the reconstructed calorimeter signal with the \(\phi\) position is small. The overall electromagnetic scale of the EMEC is obtained to be

\[\alpha^{\rm EM}_{\rm EME\,C}=(3.85\pm 0.004)\cdot 10^{-4}\,\frac{\rm GeV}{\rm nA }\quad\mbox{for}\quad\phi_{\rm norm}\in[-0.5;-0.46]\, \tag{8.7}\]

where the quoted error is purely statistical. This value is of the same magnitude as the electromagnetic scale factor of about \(4.26\cdot 10^{-4}\,\frac{\rm GeV}{\rm nA}\), which was found in stand-alone beam tests of the EMEC prototype [20]. The difference might be due to different HV settings in the prototype and in the EMEC module used in the 2002 beam test as well as a different sampling fraction due to the non-pointing geometry in the 2002 beam test.

#### Linearity of the Calorimeter Response

According to equation (8.3) the electromagnetic scale factor \(\alpha^{\rm EM}_{\rm EME\,C}\), the proportionality factor between the deposited energy and the observed ionization current, is a constant independent on the initial energy of the particle.

Figure 8.5 shows for the impact point I the electromagnetic scale factor for the \(\phi\)-interval \(\phi_{\rm norm}\in[-0.5;-0.46]\), normalized to the average electromagnetic scale factor over all beam energies in the range from 6 to 148 GeV, as a function of the beam energy (black stars). The variation is typically within \(\pm 0.5\%\). The data are compared with the relative variation of the electromagnetic scale factors for the GEANT3 (blue points) as well as GEANT4 (green squares) MC simulations. Both MC options show a similar good linearity of the electromagnetic scale as the data. Nevertheless the electromagnetic scale factor, the proportionality constant between the "visible" and the deposited energy, see equation (5.1), differs by about 6% between GEANT3 and GEANT4, see section 5.5.

The electromagnetic scale factor has been derived by summing the calorimeter signal of all EMEC read-out cells in order to take the deposited energy beyond the reconstructed clusters into account. On the other hand the event by event reconstruction of the energy uses only the ionization signals inside the clusters as input:

\[E^{\rm reco}_{\rm EMEC}=\alpha^{\rm EM}_{\rm EME\,C}I^{\rm in\, cluster}_{\rm EME\,C}\, \tag{8.8}\]

where \(E^{\rm reco}_{\rm EMEC}\) is the reconstructed energy and \(I^{\rm in\,cluster}_{\rm EME\,C}\) is the total ionization signal in the EMEC clusters.

Figure 8.6 shows the ratio between the reconstructed energy from the EMEC clusters and the beam energy in the \(\phi\)-interval \(\phi_{\rm norm}\in[-0.5;-0.46]\) for beam energies between 6 and

148 GeV at the impact point I for the data (black stars) in comparison to the GEANT 3 (blue dots) and GEANT4 (green squares) MC simulation predictions. The ratio increases with the beam energy from about 88% for 6 GeV electrons to about 97% for beams of 100 GeV and more. Also the relative reconstructed energy in the clusters for both MC options increases with the beam energy, but it is always somewhat higher compared to the data, especially for small energies. This effect might be due to cross-talk effects between the EMEC channels, which are not described in the MC simulations.

#### Uniformity of the EMEC Response

Another measure of importance is the uniformity of the response of the EMEC. Figure 8.7 shows for a horizontal scan with 119 GeV positrons (at the three standard impact points H, I and J plus 2 surrounding points each at the same, see figures 3.11 and 3.10) the ratio of the reconstructed energy in the EMEC clusters to the beam energy versus the impact position, binned in read-out channels relative to the center of the EMEC. Thereby the electromagnetic scale factor is used.

Because of the energy leakage beyond the reconstructed cluster, the ratio between the reconstructed energy and the beam energy is slightly below one, see figure 8.6. The reconstructed energies vary by. As the variation of the cluster leakage is well below this value, the variations of the EMEC response for different impact positions reflect to a large extent the systematics in the channel-to-channel calibration. In ATLAS the high statistics sample of the boson decays can be used to correct in situ for any channel-to-channel variation of this type.

Figure 8.5: Relative variation of the electromagnetic scale factor, for the -interval, at the impact point I for particular beam energies with respect to the average electromagnetic scale factor over all beam energies in the range from 6 to 148 GeV (black stars) in comparison to the predictions from GEANT3 (blue points) and GEANT4 (green squares) MC simulations. The variation is typically within.

## Chapter 8 Performance for Electrons

The ratio increases with the beam energy for the data and MC simulations, although the predicted ratio in the MC simulations is always somewhat higher, especially for small energies.

Figure 8.7: Variation of the reconstructed energy relative to the beam energy for 119 GeV positrons at the three standard impact points H, I and J plus 2 surrounding points each at the same \(\eta\) using the electromagnetic scale factor \(\alpha_{\mathrm{EMEC}}^{\mathrm{EM}}=0.3855\frac{\mathrm{MeV}}{\mathrm{nA}}\) as a function of the reconstructed \(\phi\)-position, binned in read-out channels relative to the center of the EMEC. The signal response varies by \(\pm\) 1.5%, which is mainly due to channel-to-channel calibration differences, see text.

### 8.4 Electron Energy Resolution

As the main purpose of the calorimeters in ATLAS will be the energy reconstruction, the energy resolution for electrons and positrons and its dependence on the deposited energy is one of the main benchmark factors that describe the performance of the EMEC in the beam test.

Due to the differences in the impact direction between the beam test setup and the future ATLAS setup the observed energy resolution in the beam test might differ from the energy resolution of the EMEC in ATLAS.

The energy resolution is determined from the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean of a Gaussian fit to the distribution of the reconstructed signal after the corrections mentioned above, see figure 8.4.

#### Electronics Noise

As the total reconstructed energy is computed from event by event varying clusters, also the cluster noise, the quadratic sum of the noise of all cluster cells, see equation (6.12), varies event by event. The total electronics noise, \(\sigma_{\text{noise}}\), is determined event by event as the quadratic sum of the cluster noise values, \(\sigma_{\text{noise}}^{\text{cluster}}\), of all EMEC clusters:

\[\sigma_{\text{noise}}^{2}=\sum_{\text{EMEC clusters }i}\left(\alpha_{\text{EMEC}}^{\text{EM}}\sigma_{\text{noise}}^{\text{ cluster},i}\right)^{2}\;, \tag{8.9}\]

whereby the cluster noise values are uncorrelated, see section 6.2.5. Figure 8.8 shows the distribution of the total electronics noise in the EMEC clusters for a 148 GeV electron run at the impact point I (black histogram), together with a Gaussian fit (blue line) with a maximum at about 265 MeV and a standard deviation of about 9 MeV.

#### Energy Dependence of the Energy Resolution

For sampling calorimeters the energy resolution can be parameterized, see equation (2.16), as:

\[\frac{\sigma(E_{\text{reco}})}{E_{\text{reco}}}=\frac{a}{\sqrt{E_{\text{reco}} }}\oplus\textit{b}\oplus\frac{\langle\sigma_{\text{noise}}\rangle}{E_{\text{ reco}}}\;, \tag{8.10}\]

where \(E_{\text{reco}}\) is the reconstructed energy, ideally equal to the total deposited energy, \(a\) is the so called sampling term, \(b\) the constant term and \(\langle\sigma_{\text{noise}}\rangle\) is the mean electronics noise contribution to the resolution.

As the mean cluster size depends on the energy of the incident particle, the mean electronics noise depends on the energy of the incident particle also. Therefore the mean noise contribution is subtracted in quadrature from the observed resolution to obtain the intrinsic resolution of the calorimeter, \(\frac{\sigma^{\cdot}|E_{\text{reco}}|}{E_{\text{reco}}}\).

\[\frac{\sigma^{\prime}(E_{\rm reco})}{E_{\rm reco}}=\frac{\sigma(E_{\rm reco})}{E_{ \rm reco}}\ominus\frac{\langle\sigma_{\rm noise}(E_{\rm reco})\rangle}{E_{\rm reco }}=\frac{a}{\sqrt{E_{\rm reco}}}\oplus b. \tag{8.11}\]

The energy dependence of the energy resolution has been studied for energy scans with electrons and positrons in the energy range from 6 GeV to 148 GeV at all nine standard impact points C to K, see figure 3.11. As an example, figure 8.9 shows the intrinsic energy resolution as a function of the reconstructed energy within the clusters for electrons and positrons at the impact point J for the data (solid stars) together with GEANT3 (blue points) and GEANT4 (green squares) MC predictions. No corrections for energy deposits beyond the reconstructed clusters are made. The noise has been subtracted from the energy resolution, but the noise contribution to the resolution, \(\frac{\langle\sigma_{\rm noise}\rangle}{E_{\rm reco}}\), is shown for the data as open stars as well.

A fit to the data with equation (8.11) yields for the sampling term \(a=(12.1\pm 0.2)\%\sqrt{\rm GeV}\) and for the constant term \(b=(0.37\pm 0.11)\%\). The GEANT4 simulation describes the data rather well (sampling term \((11.6\pm 0.4)\%\sqrt{\rm GeV}\) and constant term \((0.97\pm 0.10)\%\)). The GEANT3 simulation predicts an energy resolution, which is somewhat better (sampling term \((9.4\pm 0.1)\%\sqrt{\rm GeV}\) and constant term \((0.00\pm 0.14)\%\)). For the fits of the energy dependence of the resolution the shown errors at each point are purely statistical and are scaled to obtain a \(\chi^{2}/\rm n.d.f.=1\).

Although the impact angle of the combined beam test is different from the one in the pointing EMEC stand-alone beam test in the year 2000 the obtained energy resolution agrees well with the values obtained in the stand-alone beam test of \(a\approx 12.3\%\sqrt{\rm GeV}\) and \(b\approx 0.1\%\)[6].

As the description of electromagnetic processes in GEANT4 is very similar to GEANT3 with only minor additions the observed difference in the predicted resolution between the

Figure 8.8: Distribution of the total electronics noise in the EMEC clusters for electrons of 148 GeV at the impact point I (black histogram), shown together with a Gaussian fit (blue line) with a maximum at about 265 MeV and a standard deviation of about 9 MeV.

two MC simulations is not expected and still under investigation [68]. The reason for the difference can be due to differences in the detailed geometrical descriptions of the EMEC detector. This is especially important as the simulations use pencil like beams which probe the EMEC structure very localized. Also slightly different impact positions with respect to the EMEC absorbers can affect the resolution due to the varying sampling fraction of the EMEC, as it can be seen in the \(\phi\) variation of the reconstructed signal.

#### Uniformity of the Energy Resolution

The energy resolution has been studied for all nine standard impact points. Figures 8.10 and 8.11 show the related sampling and constant terms for the impact points C to K. The sampling and constant terms show a weak correlation. Nevertheless the sampling term \(a\) seems to have a small \(\eta\)-dependence, it is smaller for the standard impact points C, D, E and F at the impact row at \(\eta\approx 1.65\) (in the first EMEC layer) than for the standard impact points H, I, J and K at \(\eta\approx 1.55\), see figure 3.11. This might be due to the \(\eta\)-variation of the sampling fraction and the variation of the size of the read-out cells and has also been observed in the EMEC stand-alone beam tests [6].

### 8.5 Position Reconstruction

In the 2002 combined beam test the beam particles entered the EMEC perpendicular to its front face, see figure 7.2. The read-out cells were not pointing towards the beam particles in \(\eta\). This resulted in a distribution of the calorimeter signal to a larger number of cells in \(\eta\) than in the pointing ATLAS case. Moreover the tilt between the calorimeter cells and

Figure 8.9: Energy dependence of the energy resolution for electrons and positrons at the impact point I. Shown are the noise subtracted data (full stars) as well as the GEANT3 (blue dots) and GEANT4 (green squares) MC predictions. Also shown is the noise contribution to the resolution (open stars). The lines show the results of the fit (see text).

the shower axis introduces a depency of the reconstructed \(\eta\) barycenter on the longitudinal shower development. This degraded the position resolution in \(\eta\) in comparison to former pointing beam tests and the future ATLAS situation.

Nevertheless the read-out structures of the EMEC do point towards the beam origin in the \(\phi\) direction, which corresponds to the \(x\)-direction in the beam test coordinate system

Figure 8.11: Dependence of the constant term of the energy resolution on the impact point. The impact points C to F are in the \(\eta\) region of about 1.55 and the impact points G to K in the \(\eta\) region of about 1.65.

Figure 8.10: Dependence of the sampling term of the energy resolution on the impact point. The impact points C to F are in the \(\eta\) region of about 1.55 and the impact points G to K in the \(\eta\) region of about 1.65. The solid black line represents the weighted average of the sampling term of all impact points of about 11.8%\(\sqrt{\text{GeV}}\).

for small \(x\). This allows the reconstruction of the impact position from the hyacenters, as it is employed above. Thereby the effects of the finite cell size have to be corrected for, see [6].

Figure 8.12 shows as a typical example the distribution of the difference between the reconstructed x-impact position and the extrapolated MWPC position (black histogram) together with a Gaussian fit to the distribution (blue line) for 148 GeV electrons at the impact point I. The impact position is reconstructed from the highest energetic cluster in the second EMEC layer, using linear energy weights, see equation (6.10), and corrected for the finite cell size [6]. The MWPC position is extrapolated to the center of the second EMEC layer. The Gaussian is centered around zero and has a standard deviation of about 0.9 mm.

As the width of the Gaussian distribution reflects the total error of the track determination by the MWPCs plus the error of the position reconstruction from the cluster barycenter, the resolution of the reconstructed x-impact position is at least 0.9 mm. This compares to a typical width of a read-out cell in the x-direction in the second EMEC layer at \(\eta=1.6\) of about 4.2 cm. In the pointing stand-alone EMEC beam test a resolution of about 0.63 mm (including the MWPC precision) was found [6].

## Chapter 9 Performance for Pions

In order to study the performance of the combined Electromagnetic End-cap Calorimeter (EMEC) and Hadronic End-cap Calorimeter (HEC) for pions, they have been exposed to beams of positive and negative pions of energies between 10 and 200 GeV at 9 selected impact points, see figure 3.11.

This chapter covers:

* the energy reconstruction in the EMEC and the HEC on the electromagnetic scale (using the calibration constants found for electrons)
* the reconstruction of the deposited energy using the cluster weighting approach
* the reconstruction of the deposited energy using the cell weighting approach
* the resolution of the reconstructed energy using both weighting approaches
* the impact of the application of the weighting approaches for pions on the energy reconstruction for electrons.

First the total calorimeter signals of the EMEC and the HEC are reconstructed from the sum of all cluster ionization signals. The ionization signals are transfered into an energy deposit on the electromagnetic scale.

As the EMEC and the HEC have a smaller response to pions than to electrons, the reconstructed energy on the electromagnetic scale, using the scale factors \(\,\alpha_{\mathrm{EMEC/HEC}}^{\mathrm{EM}}\) determined for electrons, has to be multiplied by an appropriate weight factor to reconstruct the true deposited energy, see section 2.4.3. Therefore two weighting approaches have been developed based on weighting approaches used in previous experiments, see [29, 30, 31] and references therein, to determine the needed weight factors event by event.

Thereafter the resolution of the reconstructed energy is studied. Its dependence on the energy of the incoming particle is parameterized, see section 2.4.2. The results obtained are compared with the ones obtained in the stand-alone HEC beam test in the year 2000 [7] and with the predictions from Monte Carlo simulations.

Finally it is examined which impact the weighting approaches for pion showers have on the energy reconstruction and resolution for purely electromagnetic showers.

### 9.1 Energy Reconstruction on the Electromagnetic Scale

As for the electron energy reconstruction the read-out cell signals are reconstructed using the optimal filtering method together with the global cubic event timing, see chapter 4. From the cell signals clusters in all EMEC and HEC longitudinal layers are formed event by event using the TBClusters software package, see section 6.2. They are used as input for all further analysis, whereas in the 2000 HEC stand-alone beam test [7] a fixed size cluster around the impact position has been used.

The reconstruction of the particle energy is based on the total signal in the clusters, given by the sum of their ionization currents. To take into account the smaller sampling ratio of the HEC2 (HEC layer 3 in the beam test), see section 1.2.2, the ionization signal from the HEC2 clusters is multiplied by a factor of two. Moreover corrections for the high voltage failures in the HEC are applied, see section 7.2. The resolution of the EMEC and HEC for pions is mainly determined by the large fluctuations in the hadronic showers. Thus no corrections are applied to the reconstructed signal in the EMEC for its dependence on the relative time between the particle impact into the calorimeter and the read-out clock, nor for the \(\phi\)-dependence of the EMEC signal, see section 8.2.

Thereafter the total ionization currents in the EMEC and HEC clusters, \(I_{\text{in cluster}}^{\text{EMEC / HEC}}\), are converted into energies on the electromagnetic (EM) scale, \(E_{\text{EMEC / HEC clusters}}^{\text{EM scale}}\):

\[E_{\text{EMEC / HEC clusters}}^{\text{EM scale}}=\alpha_{\text{EMEC / HEC}}^{\text{EM}}\cdot I_{\text{in cluster}}^{\text{EMEC / HEC}}. \tag{9.1}\]

For the EMEC the determined value of \(\alpha_{\text{EMEC / HEC }}^{\text{EM}}=(0.3855\pm 0.0004\pm 0.0058)\frac{\text{MeV}}{ \text{nA}}\) is used, see section 8.3, where the first error represents the statistical uncertainty and the second one comes from the systematic errors due to the dependence of the reconstructed energy in the EMEC on the impact position in \(\phi\), see section 8.2.2. For the HEC the results from previous electron data in the stand-alone beam test runs are used [7]. With respect to [7] a correction for the calibration pulse shape had to be applied, yielding in summary a value of \(\alpha_{\text{HEC }}^{\text{EM}}=(3.266\pm 0.065)\frac{\text{MeV}}{\text{nA}}\)[39], where the error includes both statistic and systematic errors.

As an example figures 9.1 and 9.2 show the energy response on the EM scale in the EMEC and HEC for 200 GeV pions at the impact point J. The data (black histograms) are compared to the MC predictions: blue histogram for GEANT3 and red or green histogram for the GEANT4 physics lists QGSP and LHEP, respectively, see section 5.2. The GEANT3 and GEANT4 QGSP simulations describe the observed spectra of the energy deposits on the EM scale in the EMEC reasonably well. In the HEC the GEANT3 and GEANT4 QGSP predictions follow the general trend of the data, but predict a somewhat higher reconstructed energy on the electromagnetic scale. In contrast, the GEANT4 LHEP simulation predictions deviate for both calorimeters substantially from the data.

About half of the pions do not interact inelastically via the strong force in the EMEC. They deposit only energy due to ionization there, and are included in the first bin of the EMEC spectrum. These events mainly contribute to the peak of the energy distribution on the EM scale in the HEC at about 150 GeV.

## Chapter 9 Performance for Pions

The combined energy deposits on the EM scale in the EME C and HEC are shown in figure 9.3. The distributions of the energy deposits for the data as well as for the MC simulations

Figure 9.2: Energy deposit of 200 GeV pions at the impact point J in the HEC on the EM scale for the data (black histogram) and GEANT3 (blue histogram), GEANT4 QGSP (red histogram) and GEANT4 LHEP (green histogram) MC simulations. The GEANT3 and GEANT4 QGSP predictions follow the data with a general trend to higher energies, whereas GEANT4 LHEP predicts a somewhat different form of the spectrum.

Figure 9.1: Energy deposit of 200 GeV pions at the impact point J in the EMC on the EM scale for the data (black histogram) and GEANT3 (blue histogram), GEANT4 QGSP (red histogram) and GEANT4 LHEP (green histogram) MC simulations. GEANT3 and GEANT4 QGSP describe the data reasonably well, while the GEANT4 LHEP predicts a somewhat different form of the spectrum.

have pronounced peaks below the beam energy of 200 GeV. Although the shape and the width of the peaks of the reconstructed energies are quite similar for the data and for the MC simulations, the position of the peak differs between the data (at about 155 GeV) and the three MC simulations (GEANT3: about 164 GeV, GEANT4 QGSP: about 162 GeV and GEANT4 LHEP: about 156 GeV). Although GEANT3 and GEANT4 QGSP describe the spectrum of energy deposits in the EMEC and HEC better than GEANT4 LHEP, they predict on average a too high reconstructed energy on the EM scale.

Taking into account the predicted energy leakage outside the detector of four to six percent of the initial pion energy, see section 5.4, the reconstructed energy on the EM scale is less than the true deposited energy in the calorimeter modules. The combined EMEC and HEC calorimeters are under-compensating, see section 2.4.1. Thus the reconstructed energy in each read-out cell on the EM scale, \(E_{\mathrm{cell}}^{\mathrm{EM\ scale}}\), has to be multiplied by an appropriate weight factor, \(w\), to reconstruct the true energy deposit, \(E_{\mathrm{cell}}^{\mathrm{depo}}\), see section 2.4.3:

\[E_{\mathrm{cell}}^{\mathrm{depo}}=w\cdot E_{\mathrm{cell}}^{\mathrm{EM\ scale}}. \tag{9.2}\]

In general \(w\) is not a constant, but a function of the total energy deposit and the actual fluctuations of the hadronic shower.

As the MC simulations predict a somewhat higher reconstructed energy on the EM scale, especially GEANT3 and GEANT4 QGSP, this corresponds to a smaller level of under-compensation, a smaller weight factor \(w\), see section 9.5.

Figure 9.3: Sum of the energy deposits in the EMEC and in the HEC for 200 GeV pions at the impact point J on the EM scale for the data (black histogram) and GEANT3 (blue histogram), GEANT4 QGSP (red histogram) and GEANT4 LHEP (green histogram) MC simulations. The differences in the mean reconstructed energies reflect different levels of under-compensation in the data and in the simulation, see text.

### 9.2 Energy Reconstruction using the Cluster Weighting

The EMEC and HEC are under-compensating, see section 2.4.1. Their ionization signal response to hadrons is significantly smaller that the one for electrons of the same energy due to "invisible" energy deposits in hadronic interactions. Therefore the weighting function \(w\), see equation (9.2), is greater than one, whereas it is one for electromagnetic showers.

Each hadronic shower has an electromagnetic component, i.e. electromagnetic sub-showers from the decay of neutral pions into two photons, see section 2.2.2, which is subject to large fluctuations. Therefore the weighting factor \(w\) should reflect event by event the composition of the pion shower of electromagnetic and purely hadronic energy deposits, see section 2.4.3. Depending on the relative amount of electromagnetic and hadronic energy deposits the weighting function is expected to be in the range:

\[w_{\text{pure\,hadronic}}>w>w_{\text{electromagnetic}}=1\, \tag{9.3}\]

where \(w_{\text{pure\,hadronic}}\) is the weight function for a purely hadronic energy deposit. In case of an electromagnetic shower the weight function is equal to one: \(w_{\text{electromagnetic}}=1\).

Electromagnetic and hadronic showers can be distinguished by their energy density \(\rho\):

\[\rho=\frac{E^{\text{EM\,scale}}}{V_{\text{shower}}}\, \tag{9.4}\]

where \(E^{\text{EM\,scale}}=\alpha^{\text{EM}}I\) is the reconstructed energy of the shower on the electromagnetic scale, which is proportional to the ionization current \(I\), and \(V_{\text{shower}}\) is the volume of the shower, which has to be defined properly.

The size of electromagnetic showers scales with the radiation length \(X_{0}\) and the size of hadronic showers scales approximately with the hadronic interaction length \(\lambda_{I}\). For the materials used in the EMEC and HEC, see table 2.1, the hadronic interaction length is about one order of magnitude larger than the radiation length. So the energy densities of electromagnetic showers are much higher than the overall energy densities of hadronic showers, but each hadronic shower has hot spots of high energy densities from electromagnetic sub-showers.

Thus the total energy density \(\rho\) of a pion shower is a good measure for its relative content of electromagnetic sub-showers. A small energy density corresponds to a nearly purely hadronic shower whereas a high energy density corresponds to a nearly electromagnetic shower.

So the weight factor \(w\) in equation (9.2) is a function of the observed energy density of the pion shower:

\[w = w\left(\frac{E^{\text{EM\,scale}}}{V_{\text{shower}}},E_{\text{ beam}}\right)\, \tag{9.5}\]where a general dependence of the weight factor on the energy of the incoming pion is also included.

The approach of "Cluster Weighting" employs the topological clusters for the energy reconstruction. It exploits the fact that the clusters are not of a fixed size but the read-out cells that contain a sizeable signal are grouped together event by event. Thus the volume of the pion shower is approximated by the sum of the cluster volumes in the EMEC and HEC, \(V_{\text{EMEC / HEC clusters}}\), see section 6.2.5, and used as input for the weight factor \(w\).

As the EMEC and the HEC have different absorber materials, lead and copper respectively, with different radiation and hadronic interaction lengths, separate weights for the EMEC and the HEC are used. First the energy deposits in the clusters are reconstructed on the electromagnetic scale and the energy densities of the shower in the EMEC and in the HEC, \(\rho_{\text{EMEC / HEC}}\), are computed separately as the ratio of the total reconstructed energy on the electromagnetic scale in all clusters and the corresponding sum of the cluster volumes:

\[\rho_{\text{EMEC / HEC}}=\frac{E_{\text{EMEC / HEC clusters}}^{\text{EM scale}}}{V_{\text{EMEC / HEC clusters}}}. \tag{9.6}\]

Then the cluster energies on the electromagnetic scale, \(E_{\text{EMEC / HEC clusters}}^{\text{EM scale}}\), are multiplied by the weight factor \(w_{\text{EMEC / HEC }}\left(\rho_{\text{EMEC / HEC }},E_{\text{beam}}\right)\) to be equal to the total deposited energy, \(E_{\text{EMEC / HEC clusters}}^{\text{reco}}\):

\[E_{\text{EMEC / HEC clusters}}^{\text{reco}}=w_{\text{EMEC / HEC }}\left(\rho_{\text{EMEC / HEC }},E_{\text{beam}}\right)E_{\text{EMEC / HEC clusters}}^{\text{EM scale}}. \tag{9.7}\]

#### Energy Leakage

To obtain an estimate of the true energy deposited in the clusters, \(E_{\text{depo}}\), the energy deposits beyond the clusters boundaries, \(E_{\text{leak}}\), have to be taken into account:

\[E_{\text{beam }}=E_{\text{depo}}+E_{\text{leak}}\, \tag{9.8}\]

where \(E_{\text{beam}}\) is the energy of the incoming pion. There are two possibilities for energy deposits beyond the cluster boundaries: First energy deposits in the detector but outside the reconstructed clusters, \(E_{\text{clus leak}}\), and second energy leaking outside the detector set-up, \(E_{\text{calo leak}}\), such that:

\[E_{\text{leak}}=E_{\text{clus leak}}+E_{\text{calo leak}}. \tag{9.9}\]

The energy leakage outside the clusters which is still contained inside the calorimeter boundaries is determined for each event from the sum of the reconstructed ionization

in the EMEC and HEC, \(\frac{E_{\rm EMEC}^{\rm EM\,real}}{V_{\rm EMEC}^{\rm EM\,real}/\,\rm HEC\,clusters}\), for negative pions of 200 GeV at the impact point J.

The leakage decreases with increasing energy density in the EMEC from about 14 GeV (about 7 % of the beam energy) at an energy density of 0.001 \(\frac{\rm GeV}{\rm cm^{3}}\) to about 4 GeV (about 2 % of the beam energy) at an energy density of 0.0035 \(\frac{\rm GeV}{\rm cm^{3}}\). A higher energy density in the EMEC indicates an early starting pion shower with a high electromagnetic content. As electromagnetic showers are much denser than hadronic showers and thus have a negligible energy leakage outside the calorimeter setup, this energy leakage decreases for pion showers with increasing energy density in the EMEC.

Contrary to that the energy leakage out of the calorimeter modules is nearly independent on the energy density in the HEC clusters, see figure 9.6.

#### Proof of Concept: Cluster Weighting in the EMEC only

To demonstrate the procedure of cluster weighting, the events of a 30 GeV pion run are selected, in which most of the energy is deposited in the EMEC, such that there are no clusters reconstructed in the HEC. For these events equations (9.7) and (9.8) give:

\[E_{\rm beam}=E_{\rm leak}+w_{\rm EMEC}\left(\rho_{\rm EMEC},E_{\rm beam}=30\ \rm GeV \right)E_{\rm EME\,C\,clusters}^{\rm EM\,scale}\, \tag{9.11}\]

with \(E_{\rm leak}=E_{\rm dust\,leak}+E_{\rm calo\,leak}\left(\rho_{\rm EMEC},E_{ \rm beam}=30\ \rm GeV\right)\), \(E_{\rm clus\,leak}\) is determined event by event from the data and \(E_{\rm calo\,leak}\) is taken from the MC simulations depending on the energy density in the EMEC clusters, see section 9.2.1. As the weight factor \(w\) is the only unknown in the above equation (9.11), it can be directly derived as a function of the energy density in the EMEC:

\[w_{\rm EMEC\,C}\left(\rho_{\rm EMEC\,C},30\ \rm GeV\right)=\frac{E_{\rm EMEC}^{ \rm dep}}{E_{\rm EMEC\,clusters}^{\rm EM\,scale}}=\frac{E_{\rm beam}-E_{\rm leak }}{E_{\rm EME\,C\,clusters}^{\rm EM\,scale}}. \tag{9.12}\]

Figure 9.7 shows the derived weight factor \(w_{\rm EMEC\,C}\) as a function of the energy density in the EMEC clusters. The weight factor decreases with the reconstructed energy density in the EMEC from about 1.7 at an energy density of \(4\cdot 10^{-4}\,\frac{\rm GeV}{\rm cm^{3}}\) to about 1.0 at \(16\cdot 10^{-4}\,\frac{\rm GeV}{\rm cm^{3}}\). Thus for high energy densities in the EMEC the weight approaches unity, as expected for a mainly electromagnetic energy deposit.

The weight dependence on the energy density is described using a parameterization, as it has been applied in previous experiments [27, 62]:

\[w_{\rm EMEC}\left(\rho_{\rm EMEC\,C},E_{\rm beam}\right)=C_{1}\exp\left(-\,C _{2}\rho_{\rm EMEC\,C}\right)+C_{3}. \tag{9.13}\]

The parameterization yields a good fit to the data, \(\chi^{2}/\rm n.d.f=16.3/31\). The parameters \(C_{i}\) are obtained to be: \(C_{1}=1.51\pm 0.16\), \(C_{2}=(1500\pm 500)\frac{\rm cm^{3}}{\rm GeV}\) and \(C_{3}=0.88\pm 0.16\). The parameter \(C_{3}\) is the limit of the weight \(w\) for high energy densities, i.e. electromagnetic energy deposits, and therefore expected to equal one.

Thereafter the parameterization \(w_{\rm EMEC}=w_{\rm EMEC}\,(\rho_{\rm EMEC,}\,\,\,C_{i})\) of the EMEC weight, see equation (9.13), is used event by event to reconstruct the deposited energy from the observed energy on the EM scale:

\[E_{\rm EMEC\,\,clusters}^{\rm reco}\,=[C_{1}\exp{(-C_{2}\,\rho_{\rm EMEC})}+C _{3}]\,E_{\rm EMEC\,\,clusters}^{\rm EM\,\,scale}\,. \tag{9.14}\]

Figure 9.8 shows the distribution of the EMEC cluster energy for the selected 30 GeV pions at the impact point J, that only have clusters in the EMEC, on the electromagnetic scale (red histogram) and a after the application of the parameterized EMEC cluster weights (blue histogram) together with Gaussian fits to the distributions. The mean reconstructed energy on the electromagnetic scale is 17.9 GeV whereas after weighting it is 24.3 GeV. This corresponds to a beam energy of 30 GeV minus energy deposits beyond the reconstructed clusters of about 4 GeV that are contained in the calorimeter modules and another 1.7 GeV energy leakage outside the calorimeter modules.

The resolution of the reconstructed energy after the event by event application of the weights is \(\frac{\sigma(E_{\rm EMEC\,\,clusters}^{\rm reco})}{E_{\rm EMEC\,\,clusters}^{ \rm reco}}=(15.1\pm 0.5)\%\). This resolution has to be compared to the resolution that can be obtained in the case of a constant weight for the whole run, that does not reflect the event to event fluctuations of the pion shower:

\[E_{\rm EMEC\,\,clusters}^{\rm reco}={\rm const}\cdot E_{\rm EMEC\,\,clusters}^{\rm EM\,\,scale}\,. \tag{9.15}\]

Figure 9.7: Derived EMEC weight factor \(w_{\rm EMEC}\) for 30 GeV pions at the impact point J that have no clusters in the HEC as a function of the energy density in the EMEC clusters. The weight decreases with the EMEC energy density and approaches unity for high densities, as expected for a mainly electromagnetic energy deposit. The line shows the result of a fit with the parameterization function for the EMEC weights, see text.

which is equal to the resolution of the reconstructed energy on the EM scale of \(\frac{\sigma(E\,\mathrm{EMEC}\,\mathrm{scale})}{E\,\mathrm{EMEC}\,\mathrm{ cluster}}=(26.2\,\pm 0.5)\%\). Thus the event by event cluster weighting substantially improves the resolution of the reconstructed energy.

#### Determination of the Cluster Weights in EMEC and HEC

In general both sub-detectors, the EMEC as well as the HEC, have to be considered for the energy reconstruction of pions:

\[E_{\mathrm{beam}}=E_{\mathrm{leak}} + w_{\mathrm{EMEC}}\,(\rho_{\mathrm{EMEC}},E_{\mathrm{beam}})\,E_{ \mathrm{EMEC}\,\mathrm{clusters}}^{\mathrm{EM\,scale}}\] \[+ w_{\mathrm{HE\,C}}\,(\rho_{\mathrm{HEC}},E_{\mathrm{beam}})\,E_{ \mathrm{HE\,C}\,\mathrm{clusters}}^{\mathrm{EM\,scale}}\.\]

Because of the different materials and granularities of the EMEC and the HEC different weights, \(w_{\mathrm{EMEC}\,/\,\mathrm{HE\,C}}\), with different dependencies on the energy densities in the clusters have to be applied. For given energy densities and known leakage, \(E_{\mathrm{leak}}\), the above equation (9.16) is still not sufficient to determine for a single event and the weight factors for the EMEC and the HEC uniquely.

The dependencies of the weight factors \(w_{\mathrm{EMEC}\,/\,\mathrm{HE\,C}}\) on the energy densities, are parameterized analogously to equation (9.13). The reconstructed energies in the EMEC and HEC, \(E_{\mathrm{EMEC}\,/\,\mathrm{HE\,C}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\) are then given by:

Figure 9.8: Distributions of the reconstructed energies in the EMEC clusters for 30 GeV pions that have no clusters in the HEC on the EM scale (red histogram) and after the application of the parameterized cluster weights (blue histogram), shown together with Gaussian fits to the distributions. The cluster weighting reconstructs on average the true deposited energy and also improves the resolution of the reconstructed energy with respect to the reconstruction on the EM scale.

\[E_{\text{\tiny{EMEC}}}^{\text{\tiny{reco}}}\left(C_{i}^{\text{\tiny{EMEC }}}\right) = \left[C_{1}^{\text{\tiny{EMEC}}}\exp\left(-C_{2}^{\text{\tiny{EMEC}}} \rho_{\text{\tiny{EMEC}}}\right)+C_{3}^{\text{\tiny{EMEC}}}\right]E_{\text{ \tiny{EMEC}}\text{\tiny{class}}}^{\text{\tiny{EM scale}}} \tag{9.17}\] \[E_{\text{\tiny{HEC}}}^{\text{\tiny{reco}}}\left(C_{i}^{\text{ \tiny{EMEC}}}\right) = \left[C_{1}^{\text{\tiny{HEC}}}\exp\left(-C_{2}^{\text{\tiny{HE }}}\rho_{\text{\tiny{HEC}}}\right)+C_{3}^{\text{\tiny{HEC}}}\right]E_{\text{ \tiny{HEC}}\text{\tiny{class}}}^{\text{\tiny{EM scale}}}\, \tag{9.18}\]

where the six parameters \(C_{i}^{\text{\tiny{EMEC}}}\) and \(C_{i}^{\text{\tiny{HEC}}}\) in general depend on the beam energy. The parameters are determined run by run by minimizing the difference between the beam energy, \(E_{\text{\tiny{beam}}}\), and the total reconstructed energy in the EMEC and the HEC clusters plus the energy deposits beyond the reconstructed clusters according to equation (9.16). Therefore a \(\chi^{2}\) is constructed and numerically minimized run by run to obtain the parameters \(C_{i}\):

\[\chi^{2} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\text{\tiny{events}}}\frac{\left[E_{\text{\tiny{ beam}}}-E_{\text{\tiny{clus leak}}}-E_{\text{\tiny{calo leak}}}^{\text{\tiny{EMEC}}}-E_{\text{\tiny{HEC}}}^{ \text{\tiny{reco}}}(C_{i}^{\text{\tiny{HEC}}})-E_{\text{\tiny{EMEC}}}^{\text{ \tiny{reco}}}(C_{i}^{\text{\tiny{EMEC}}})\right]^{2}}{\left[\left(\sigma_{\text {\tiny{noise}}}^{\text{\tiny{reco}}}(C_{i}^{\text{\tiny{EMEC}}},C_{i}^{\text{ \tiny{HEC}}})\right)^{2}+\left(\sigma_{\text{\tiny{noise}}}^{\text{\tiny{ leak}}}\right)^{2}\right]}\] \[+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\text{\tiny{events}}}\frac{\left[E_{\text{\tiny{ beam}}}-E_{\text{\tiny{clus leak}}}-E_{\text{\tiny{calo leak}}}^{\text{\tiny{HEC}}}-E_{\text{\tiny{ HEC}}}^{\text{\tiny{reco}}}(C_{i}^{\text{\tiny{HEC}}})-E_{\text{\tiny{EMEC}}}^{\text{ \tiny{reco}}}(C_{i}^{\text{\tiny{EMEC}}})\right]^{2}}{\left[\left(\sigma_{\text {\tiny{noise}}}^{\text{\tiny{reco}}}(C_{i}^{\text{\tiny{EMEC}}},C_{i}^{\text{ \tiny{HEC}}})\right)^{2}+\left(\sigma_{\text{\tiny{noise}}}^{\text{\tiny{ leak}}}\right)^{2}\right]}\.\]

The \(\chi^{2}\) is constructed simultaneously with respect to the two possible correlations between the energy leakage out of the calorimeter with the energy density in the EMEC and with the energy density in the HEC, see section 9.2.1. Thereby

\[E_{\text{\tiny{calo leak}}}^{\text{\tiny{EMEC}}\text{\tiny{/ HEC}}}=E_{\text{\tiny{calo leak}}}^{\text{\tiny{EMEC}}\text{\tiny{/ HEC}}}\left(\rho_{\text{\tiny{EMEC}}\text{\tiny{/ HEC}}},E_{\text{\tiny{beam}}}\right) \tag{9.20}\]

is the average energy leakage out of the calorimeter, determined from the GEANT4 QGSP MC simulations of the same beam energy as the data as a function of the energy densities in the EMEC or in the HEC, see for example figures 9.5 and 9.6. Presently GEANT4 QGSP simulations are only available for the impact points I and J. Thus cluster weights can only be determined for these impact point plus the impact point H which is located symmetrically with respect to the impact point J, see figure 3.11.

The energy deposits in the calorimeter but beyond the reconstructed clusters, \(E_{\text{\tiny{clus leak}}}\), are determined event by event on the EM scale according to equation (9.10).

In the constructed \(\chi^{2}\) the difference between the beam energy and the total reconstructed energy in the clusters plus the energy deposits beyond the reconstructed clusters is normalized to the quadratic sum of the total noise contribution to the reconstructed energy inside the clusters, \(\sigma_{\text{\tiny{noise}}}^{\text{\tiny{reco}}}(C_{i}^{\text{\tiny{EMEC}}},C _{i}^{\text{\tiny{HEC}}})\), and the noise contribution to the determined leakage, \(\sigma_{\text{\tiny{noise}}}^{\text{\tiny{leak}}}\).

The total electronics noise in all EMEC and HEC clusters takes into account the applied weight factors which are used for the energy reconstruction in the EMEC and HEC event by event:

\[\sigma_{\text{\tiny{noise}}}^{\text{\tiny{reco}}}(C_{i}^{\text{\tiny{EMEC}} \text{\tiny{C}}},C_{i}^{\text{\tiny{HEC}}})=\sqrt{\left(w_{\text{\tiny{EMEC}} \text{\tiny{C}}}\sigma_{\text{\tiny{noise, HEC}}}^{\text{\tiny{EM}}}\right)^{2}+\left(w_{\text{\tiny{ HEC}}}\sigma_{\text{\tiny{noise, HEC}}}^{\text{\tiny{EM}}}\right)^{2}}\, \tag{9.21}\]where \(\sigma^{\rm EM}_{\rm noise,\,\,EMEC\,/\,HE\,C}\) is the total electronics noise in all EMEC and HEC clusters on the EM scale, defined analogously to equation (8.9) as the quadratic sum of the cluster noise values \(\sigma^{\rm EMEC\,/\,HE\,C\,cluster,\,i}_{\rm noise}\) (in nA) times the corresponding electromagnetic scale factor:

\[\left(\sigma^{\rm EM}_{\rm noise\,\,EMEC\,/\,HE\,C}\right)^{2}=\sum_{\rm \begin{subarray}{c}\rm{EMEC\,/\,HE\,C}\\ \rm{clusters\,\,}i\end{subarray}}\left(\alpha^{\rm EM}_{\rm EMEC\,/\,HE\,C^{ \rm\,\,EMEC\,/\,HE\,C\,cluster,\,i}}\right)^{2}. \tag{9.22}\]

The noise contribution to the determination of the energy deposits beyond the reconstructed clusters, \(\sigma^{\rm leak}_{\rm noise}\), is given by the quadratic sum of the noise values on the EM scale of all calorimeter cells that are not included in the clusters. This value is found to be relatively independent of the event to event fluctuations of the cluster size and on the beam energy and thus is set constant to an average value of 5 GeV.

Because of the rather strong correlation between the parameters \(C_{1}\) and \(C_{2}\) of the weight function, \(C_{2}\) is set to a constant value:

\[C_{2}^{\rm{EMEC\,C}}=1000\ \frac{\rm{cm}^{3}}{\rm{GeV}}\quad\text{and}\quad C _{2}^{\rm{HEC}}=1500\ \frac{\rm{cm}^{3}}{\rm{GeV}}. \tag{9.23}\]

#### Comparison of the determined Cluster Weights for the Data and the MC Simulations

As an example figures 9.9 to 9.11 show the resulting EMEC weights \(w_{\rm{EMEC\,C}}\) as a function of the energy density in the EMEC for negative pions of 200 GeV at the impact point J:

\[w_{\rm{EMEC\,C}}\left(\rho_{\rm{EMEC\,C}},\ 200\,\rm{GeV}\right)=\frac{E_{\rm{ beam}}-E_{\rm{clus\,\,leak}}-E_{\rm{cla\,l\,leak}}^{\rm{EMEC\,C}}-E_{\rm{HEC\,C}}^{ \rm{reco}}(C_{i}^{\rm{HEC\,C}})}{E_{\rm{EMEC}}^{\rm{EMEC}}}\, \tag{9.24}\]

where \(E_{\rm{HEC\,C}}^{\rm{reco}}(C_{i}^{\rm{HEC\,C}})\) is the reconstructed energy in the HEC clusters using the determined HEC weight parameters \(C_{i}^{\rm{HEC\,C}}\).

The data are shown as black stars, the GEANT3 predictions as blue points, GEANT4 QGSP and LHEP predictions as red triangles and green squares, respectively. The EMEC weights are compared with the determined parameterization, \(w_{\rm{EMEC\,C}}\left(\rho_{\rm{EMEC\,C}},C_{i}^{\rm{EMEC\,C}}\right)\) of the EMEC weights for the data (black line). For high energy densities in the EMEC the weight approaches unity, as it is expected for a mainly electromagnetic energy deposit.

The parameterization of the EMEC weights describes the data well, but at very low and very high energy densities the errors of the data are getting rather large. Moreover, in the EMEC the dependence of the weight factor on the energy density is described well by both GEANT4 MC simulations, whereas the agreement between the data and the GEANT3 simulation is slightly worse.

The determined weights are nearly independent of the relative population of the energy densities and thus of the relative composition of the pion shower of purely hadronic parts and electromagnetic sub-showers.

Figures 9.12 to 9.14 show the dependence of the determined weight factor for the HEC

on the energy density in the HEC clusters together with the parameterization of the HEC weight for the data and the MC predictions.

The parameterizations of the HEC weights describe the energy dependence of the weights well for the data and all three MC simulations. But there are sizeable differences between the two models. The HEC weights are not well defined in the HEC weights, but they are not well defined in the HEC weights.

the weight factors determined from the data and the MC predictions. The simulations predict an up to 10 % smaller weight factor than the data, especially for small energy densities. Thus the simulations predict a different level of non-compensation in the HEC. This corresponds to the somewhat higher predicted response of the HEC, and thus of the HEC.

electromagnetic energy deposit, which does not need to be multiplied by a weight factor. Again, this is a cross-check for the validity of the electromagnetic scale factor for the HEC. The deviations of the weight parameter \(C_{3}\) from unity for smaller beam energies are to some extent due to correlations with the weight parameter \(C_{1}\) and correlations between the weight parameters of the EMEC and the HEC.

As there will be no possibility to directly determine the electromagnetic scale factor of the

Figure 9.17: Energy dependence of the weight parameter \(C_{1}\) for the HEC for positive and negative pions (gray and black stars, respectively) at the impact point J.

Figure 9.16: Energy dependence of the weight parameter \(C_{3}\) for the EMEC for positive and negative pions (gray and black stars, respectively) at the impact point J. For high energy densities \(C_{3}\) approaches unity, which gives a cross-check for the electromagnetic scale factor of the EMEC.

HEC in ATLAS, the in situ determination of \(C_{3}\) with single particles can yield a powerful cross-check of the electromagnetic scale factor taken from beam tests.

Due to the correlations amongst the weight parameters \(C_{i}\) one cannot directly compare the resulting parameters for the data and the MC simulations. The correlation between the weight parameters \(C_{1}\) and \(C_{3}\) of one sub-detector (EMEC and HEC) is observed to be stronger than the correlation between the parameters of different sub-detectors. Therefore for the MC simulations not only the parameters \(C_{2}^{\mathrm{EMEC}\;/\;\mathrm{HEC}}\) are kept fixed on the same value as for the data, see equation (9.23), but also the weight parameters \(C_{3}^{\mathrm{EMEC}\;/\;\mathrm{HEC}}\) are forced to equal the values obtained from the data. The parameters \(C_{3}\) are chosen because they represent the limit of the weight factor for high energy densities, where the observed differences between the obtained weight factors \(w\) for the data and for the MC simulations are smaller than at small energy densities. In consequence, the weight parameters \(C_{1}^{\mathrm{EMEC}\;/\;\mathrm{HEC}}\) will reflect the deviations of the MC predictions from the data, up to a weak residual correlation between \(C_{1}^{\mathrm{EMEC}\;\mathrm{C}}\) and \(C_{1}^{\mathrm{HEC}\;\mathrm{C}}\).

The fixing of the parameters \(C_{3}\) for the MC simulations only minimally affects the \(\chi^{2}\) value in equation (9.19) and thus the resolution of the reconstructed energy.

Figures 9.19 and 9.20 show the resulting weight parameters \(C_{1}^{\mathrm{EMEC}\;\mathrm{C}}\) and \(C_{1}^{\mathrm{HEC}\;\mathrm{C}}\) at the impact point J as functions of the mean reconstructed energy of the data taking run for the GEANT3 and GEANT4 LHEP and QGSP MC simulations of negative pions in comparison with the data results for positive and negative pions. All MC options follow the general trend of the data, but the differences are significant and cannot be explained by residual correlations between the weight parameters \(C_{1}\) for the EMEC and the HEC. For the EMEC the GEANT4 QGSP predictions deviate in particular at high energies. For the HEC all MC simulations are off by a rather constant factor (up to 50 % for GEANT3).

Figure 9.18: Energy dependence of the weight parameter \(C_{3}\) for the HEC for positive and negative pions (gray and black stars, respectively) at the impact point J. For high energy densities \(C_{3}\) approaches unity, which gives a cross-check for the electromagnetic scale factor of the HEC.

In general the GEANT4 LHEP simulation describes the data best, but it still deviates substantially from the data. The agreement between the data and the simulations is better for the EMEC than for the HEC. Consequently the modeling of hadronic showers in the MC simulations has to be developed further to yield an adequate description of the data.

### 9.3 Energy Reconstruction using the Cell Weighting

In the cluster weighting approach described above, the composition of a pion shower of electromagnetic and purely hadronic parts is determined event by event from the total energy density in the EMEC and HEC clusters. The whole cluster energy on the EM scale is multiplied by a weight factor to compensate offline for the "invisible energy" deposits in the purely hadronic part of the pion shower:

\[E_{\mathrm{reco}}\,=w_{\mathrm{EMEC}}\,(\rho_{\mathrm{EMEC},\mathrm{E}},E_{ \mathrm{beam}})\,E_{\mathrm{EMEC~{}clusters}}^{\mathrm{EM~{}scale}}+w_{ \mathrm{HEC}}\,(\rho_{\mathrm{HE\,C}},E_{\mathrm{beam}})\,E_{\mathrm{HEC~{} clusters}}^{\mathrm{EM~{}scale}}. \tag{9.25}\]

This procedure works well for single isolated pions in the beam test. But in ATLAS the calorimeters have to be calibrated to reconstruct the energy of jets [47]. In the case of jets there will be a heavy overlap of clusters of different origin. Thus the density criterion based on the whole cluster will get washed out and loose its power to distinguish between hadronic and electromagnetic energy deposits. Therefore for ATLAS a weighting approach

Figure 9.19: Dependence of the weight parameter \(C_{1}^{\mathrm{EMEC}}\) on the mean reconstructed energy of the run for positive and negative pions (gray and black stars, respectively) and for the GEANT3 (blue points) and GEANT4 LHEP and QGSP (green squares and red triangles, respectively) MC simulations, where the \(C_{3}\) parameters for the EMEC and the HEC are fixed for the MC simulations to the data values to suppress correlations between \(C_{1}\) and \(C_{3}\). All MC options follow the general trend of the data, but the differences are significant.

based on the read-out cell level is planned [47]. Instead of the energy density of the whole cluster the local energy density in each read-out cell is used to distinguish locally between electromagnetic and hadronic energy deposits. High local energy densities are mainly due to electromagnetic sub-showers while for purely hadronic showers the corresponding density is substantially lower. Thus for a segmented calorimeter the energy deposits in individual read-out cells can be identified to be of electromagnetic or hadronic origin on a statistical basis.

In the cell weighting approach each cell gets event by event its own weight, \(w_{\text{EMEC / HEC}}^{\text{cell}}\) depending on the energy density in this particular cell. Due to the different materials and granularities in the EMEC and the HEC different weights have to be applied in the EMEC and in the HEC. In order not to boost the electronics noise by the cell weighting, it is only applied to the read-out cells that belong to one of the topological clusters in the EMEC and the HEC:

\[E^{\text{reco}} = \sum_{\begin{subarray}{c}\text{EMEC }\text{C}\\ \text{cluster cells}\end{subarray}}w_{\text{EMEC }}^{\text{cell}}\left(\rho_{\text{EMEC }\text{cell}},E_{\text{beam}}\right)E_{\text{EMEC cell}}^{\text{EM scale}}\] \[+\sum_{\begin{subarray}{c}\text{HE C}\\ \text{cluster cells}\end{subarray}}w_{\text{HE C}}^{\text{cell}}\left(\rho_{\text{HE C cell}},E_{\text{beam}}\right)E_{\text{HEC cell}}^{\text{EM scale}},\]

where the cell energy density \(\rho_{\text{cell}}\) is defined as the absolute value of the ratio between the reconstructed cell energy on the EM scale, \(E_{\text{cell}}^{\text{EM scale}}\), and the cell volume, \(V_{\text{cell}}\):

Figure 9.20: Dependence of the weight parameter \(C_{1}^{\text{HEC}}\) on the mean reconstructed energy of the run for positive and negative pions (gray and black stars, respectively) and for the GEANT 3 (blue points) and GEANT4 LHEP and QGSP (green squares and red triangles, respectively) MC simulations, where the \(C_{3}\) parameters for the EMEC and the HEC are fixed for the MC simulations to the data values to suppress correlations between \(C_{1}\) and \(C_{3}\). All MC options follow the general trend of the data, but the differences are significant.

\[\rho_{\rm cell}=\left|\frac{E_{\rm cell}^{\rm EM\ scale}}{V_{\rm cell}}\right|. \tag{9.27}\]

#### Determination of the Cell Weights for Pions

To account for the energy density dependence of the cell weights, 26 bins of energy densities in the EMEC and in the HEC are used with one weight factor \(w_{\rm EMEC\ /\ HEC}^{\rm cell,\ i}\) each (\(i=1,\ldots,26\)), in total 52 weight factors. The first 25 energy density bins, \(\rho_{i}\leq\rho_{\rm cell}<\rho_{i+1}\) with (\(i=1,\ldots,25\)) and \(\rho_{1}=0\), are chosen equidistant run by run, whereas the 26th bin contains all cells with higher energy densities, \(\rho_{\rm cell}\geq\rho_{25}\). The width of the cell density bins is adjusted such that each energy density bin contains at least one entry.

The total reconstructed energies in the EMEC and HEC clusters, \(E_{\rm EMEC\ /\ HEC}^{\rm reco}\), are then given by:

\[E_{\rm EMEC\ /\ HEC}^{\rm reco}=\sum_{\begin{subarray}{c}{\rm cell\ densi}\\ {\rm ties\ }i=1\end{subarray}}^{26}\left[w_{\rm EMEC\ /\ HEC}^{\rm cell,\ i}\sum_{ \begin{subarray}{c}{\rm cells\ with}\\ {\rho_{i}\leq\rho_{\rm cell}<\rho_{i+1}}\end{subarray}}E_{\rm cell}^{\rm EM\ scale} \right]\,. \tag{9.28}\]

The weight parameters \(w_{\rm EMEC\ /\ HEC}^{\rm i}\) are determined by minimizing the difference between the beam energy, \(E_{\rm beam}\), and the total reconstructed energy in the EMEC and HEC plus the energy deposits beyond the clusters, see section 9.2.1. Therefore the following \(\chi^{2}\) is constructed in analogy to equation (9.19):

\[\chi^{2} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\rm events}\frac{\left[E_{\rm beam}-E_{\rm clus \ leak}-E_{\rm calo\ leak}^{\rm EEC\ }-E_{\rm HEC\ c}^{\rm reco}\left(w_{\rm HE\ C}^{\rm cell,\ i}\right)-E_{\rm E \rm MEC\ c}^{\rm reco}\left(w_{\rm EMEC}^{\rm cell,\ i}\right)\right]^{2}}{ \left[\left(\sigma_{\rm noise}^{\rm EM\ scale}\right)^{2}+\left(\sigma_{\rm noise }^{\rm leak}\right)^{2}\right]}\] \[+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\rm events}\frac{\left[E_{\rm beam\,m}-E_{\rm clus \ leak}-E_{\rm calo\ leak}^{\rm HEC}-E_{\rm HEC\ c}^{\rm reco}\left(w_{\rm HE \ C}^{\rm cell,\ i}\right)-E_{\rm E\rm MEC\ c}^{\rm reco}\left(w_{\rm E\rm MEC\ c}^{\rm cell,\ i}\right)\right]^{2}}{ \left[\left(\sigma_{\rm noise}^{\rm EM\ scale}\right)^{2}+\left(\sigma_{\rm noise }^{\rm leak}\right)^{2}\right]}\.\]

The energy leakage out of the calorimeter, \(E_{\rm calo\ leak}^{\rm EM\ scale}\), is again determined from the GEANT4 QGSP simulation as a function of the energy densities in the EMEC or in the HEC clusters. The energy deposits in the calorimeter but beyond the reconstructed clusters, \(E_{\rm clus\ leak}\), are determined event by event on the EM scale according to equation (9.10).

The total electronics noise in the clusters, \(\sigma_{\rm noise}^{\rm EM\ scale}\), is used on the EM scale in order not to introduce a further dependence on the weight parameters \(w_{\rm EMEC\ /\ HEC}^{\rm cell,\ i}\). It is given by the quadratic sum of the noise values of all EMEC and HEC clusters, according to equation (9.22). The noise contribution to the determination of the energy deposits beyond the reconstructed clusters, \(\sigma_{\rm noise}^{\rm leak}\), is set constant to an average value of 5 GeV.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:126]

energy density below 0.001 \(\frac{\mathrm{GeV}}{\mathrm{cm}^{2}}\) to values around 0.9 for an energy density of 0.004 \(\frac{\mathrm{GeV}}{\mathrm{cm}^{2}}\) and stays at this level for higher energy densities. As the weight factor is intended to correct for the smaller response of the calorimeter to hadronic showers than to electromagnetic showers, it should always be larger than one. The values smaller than one are due to correlations between the weight parameters.

In the HEC the cell weight falls from about 1.6 at an energy density of 0.0005 \(\frac{\mathrm{GeV}}{\mathrm{cm}^{2}}\) to about 1.0 at an energy density of 0.01 \(\frac{\mathrm{GeV}}{\mathrm{cm}^{2}}\). The black line in figure 9.22 represents a fit to the energy dependence of the HEC cell weight using a similar parameterization as for the cluster weights, see equation (9.13):

\[w_{\mathrm{HEC}}^{\mathrm{cell}}=C_{1}\exp{(-C_{2}\rho_{\mathrm{HEC}\ \mathrm{cell}})}+C_{3}. \tag{9.30}\]

It yields a good parameterization of most of the data, whereas the first HEC weight, corresponding to the lowest energy density bin, cannot be described.

The obtained weights are correlated amongst each other. Figure 9.23 shows the correlation of the 2 times 26 weights for the EMEC and the HEC for pions of 200 GeV. There is a sizeable anti-correlation between the HEC weight for the lowest energy density bin and the other HEC weights and a small anti-correlation between the EMEC weight for the lowest energy density and the other EMEC weights.

Figure 9.23: Correlation amongst the 26 EMEC and the 26 HEC cell weights. There is a sizeable anti-correlation of up to -0.4 between the HEC weight for the lowest energy density bin and the other HEC weights and a smaller analogue anti-correlation between the EMEC weights.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:128]

The width of the distribution after the application of the cell weights is marginally smaller than the one on the EM scale, while the mean reconstructed energy stays unaltered.

Thus the electron cell weights reduce the small fluctuations in an electron shower, rather than correct for a different calorimeter response for small and high energy densities in the electron showers.

#### Outlook: Derivation of the Cell Weights for ATLAS

The goal of the hadronic calibration for ATLAS is to derive cell weights, that do not only yield on average the true deposited energy of a whole cluster, but that give on average the true deposited energy cell by cell.

These weights can only be derived from a detailed MC simulation, that does not only predict the visible energy on the EM scale per read-out cell, \(E_{\mathrm{cell}}^{\mathrm{EM\ scale,\ MC}}\), but also the true deposited energy in the corresponding cell, \(E_{\mathrm{cell}}^{\mathrm{depo,\ MC}}\). The corresponding weight \(w_{\mathrm{cell}}^{\mathrm{MC}}\) is then simply the average ratio between the true deposited energy and the energy on the EM scale:

\[w_{\mathrm{cell}}^{\mathrm{MC}}=\left\langle\frac{E_{\mathrm{cell}}^{\mathrm{ depo,\ MC}}}{E_{\mathrm{cell}}^{\mathrm{EM\ scale,\ MC}}}\right\rangle. \tag{9.31}\]

Thus a prediction for the weight can be obtained for each read-out cell separately, taking the different granularities of the read-out cells in the different EMEC and HEC layers

Figure 9.25: Correlations amongst the derived EMEC cell weights for electrons of 148 GeV at the impact point I. The weights for small and high energy densities are anti-correlated whereas the weights for neighboring energy densities are mostly correlated.

and \(\eta\) regions into account. At the moment the prediction of the true deposited energy is being implemented in the MC simulations. Thereafter the derived cell weights from the MC simulations will be applied to the beam test data.

As indicated by the above comparisons between the data and the MC simulations, the simulations do not yet optimally describe the hadronic showers. Therefore the simulations have to be tuned before they can be used to derive weight factors and reconstruction algorithms for jets in ATLAS.

### 9.4 Pion Energy Resolution

The energy resolution for charged pions and its dependence on the deposited energy is one of the main benchmark factors that describe the performance of the combined E MEC and HEC in the beam test. Contrary to that in ATLAS the energy resolution for jets is of major concern, which cannot be directly inferred from the beam test data. It can only be estimated from detailed MC simulations.

A further difference between the beam test and the future ATLAS setup is the non-pointing impact of the beam into the EMEC and in the HEC. As for pion showers the energy is distributed over a large number of read-out cells, the influence of the non-pointing setup on the energy resolution for single pions should be small.

The deposited energy of the pions in the EMEC and HEC clusters is reconstructed using both of the developed weighting approaches, the cluster and cell weighting. As the weights do not only depend on the observed energy density but also on the beam energy, the weight

Figure 9.26: Distributions of the reconstructed energy in the EMEC clusters for 148 GeV electrons at the impact point I on the EM scale (blue histogram) and using the cell weights derived for electrons (red histogram). The mean reconstructed energy stays about the same, whereas the resolution is marginally better using the cell weights than the one on the EM scale.

parameters \(C_{i}^{\text{EMEC / HEC}}\) for the cluster weighting and the 52 cell weights \(w_{\text{EMEC / HEC}}^{\text{cell, }i}\) are first determined run by run. Then they are used to reconstruct the energy, see equations 9.17 and 9.28. No corrections for the energy deposits beyond the reconstructed clusters are applied.

This procedure is not applicable in ATLAS, where the initial energy of the particle (or the jet) is not known. There the energy has to be determined iteratively by first applying some default weight to obtain a first guess for the reconstructed energy. Then this reconstructed energy is used to choose the appropriate weights.

The energy resolution is determined form the ratio between the standard deviation of the reconstructed energy and the mean reconstructed energy, as given by a Gaussian fit to the distribution of the reconstructed signal, for each data taking run. In order to determine the intrinsic resolution of the combined EMEC and HEC for pions, \(\frac{\sigma^{\prime}(E_{\text{reco}})}{E_{\text{reco}}}\), the mean electronics noise contribution, \(\frac{\langle\sigma_{\text{noise}}(E_{\text{reco}})\rangle}{E_{\text{reco}}}\), is subtracted quadratically from the observed resolution of the reconstructed energy, \(\frac{\sigma(E_{\text{reco}})}{E_{\text{reco}}}\):

\[\frac{\sigma^{\prime}(E_{\text{reco}})}{E_{\text{reco}}}=\frac{\sigma(E_{\text {reco}})}{E_{\text{reco}}}\oplus\frac{\langle\sigma_{\text{noise}}(E_{\text{ reco}})\rangle}{E_{\text{reco}}}. \tag{9.32}\]

According to equations (2.16) and (8.11) the energy dependence of the intrinsic energy resolution is parameterized by:

\[\frac{\sigma^{\prime}(E_{\text{reco}})}{E_{\text{reco}}}=\frac{a}{\sqrt{E_{ \text{reco}}}}\oplus b. \tag{9.33}\]

#### Pion Energy Resolution using the Cluster Weights

Figure 9.27 shows the intrinsic energy resolution of the combined EMEC and HEC using the cluster weighting approach as a function of the mean reconstructed energy within the clusters for positive as well as negative pions (gray and black stars, respectively) at the impact point J. The noise has been subtracted from the energy resolution, but the noise contribution to the resolution, \(\frac{\langle\sigma_{\text{noise}}\rangle}{E_{\text{reco}}}\), is shown as open stars as well. Thereby \(\langle\sigma_{\text{noise}}\rangle\) is the mean of the total electronics noise in the EMEC and HEC clusters multiplied by the same weight factor as it is used for the energy reconstruction, see equation (9.21). The total electronics noise increases from about 1 GeV at the smallest reconstructed energies to about 1.7 GeV for 200 GeV pions.

A fit to the data using equation (9.33) yields for the sampling term \(a=(84.6\%\pm 0.3\%)\sqrt{\text{GeV}}\) and \(a=(81.7\%\pm 0.4\%)\sqrt{\text{GeV}}\) for negative and positive pions respectively and zero within errors for the constant term \(b\). The errors given are purely statistical. The vanishing of the constant term shows the effectiveness of the weighting approach to achieve a good compensation offline, see section 2.4.3.

The data are compared with the MC predictions in figure 9.28. The GEANT3 simulations predict a sampling term of \(a=(73.3\%\pm 0.5\%)\sqrt{\text{GeV}}\) and a vanishing constant term within errors. The GEANT4 LHEP and QGSP simulations predict a sampling term of \(a=(74.0\%\pm 0.5\%)\sqrt{\mathrm{GeV}}\) and \(a=(72.3\%\pm 0.5\%)\sqrt{\mathrm{GeV}}\), respectively, with non-vanishing constant terms of \(b=(4.1\pm 0.1)\%\) and \(b=(2.5\pm 0.1)\%\), respectively. In general, the GEANT4 options are closer to the data, but both QGSP and LHEP predict a larger value of \(a\).

Figure 9.28: Energy dependence of the energy resolution for positive and negative pions (gray and black stars, respectively) and MC predictions for negative pions (blue points for GEANT3, red triangles for GEANT4 QGSP and green squares for GEANT4 LHEP) at the impact point J after application of the cluster weights. The lines show the results of the fits (see text).

non-vanishing constant term in the parameterization of the resolution. GEANT3 predicts a too good resolution together with a vanishing constant term.

#### Pion Energy Resolution using the Cell Weights

Figure 9.29 shows the intrinsic energy resolution using the cell weighting approach as a function of the reconstructed energy within the clusters for positive as well as negative pions (gray and black stars, respectively) at the impact point J. The noise is subtracted from the energy resolution, but the noise contribution to the resolution, \(\frac{\langle\sigma_{\mathrm{noise}}\rangle}{E_{\mathrm{reco}}}\), is shown as open stars as well. For the mean electronics noise, \(\langle\sigma_{\mathrm{noise}}\rangle\), the same value as obtained for the cluster weighting approach is used.

A fit to the data using equation (9.33) yields for the sampling term \(a=(80.7\%\pm 0.4\%)\sqrt{\mathrm{GeV}}\) and \(a=(79.4\%\pm 1.4\%)\sqrt{\mathrm{GeV}}\) for negative and positive pions, respectively, and zero within errors for the constant term. As in the case of the cluster weighting the vanishing of the constant term shows the effectiveness of the weighting approach to achieve a good compensation offline.

#### Discussion

Both weighting approaches yield a similar resolution of the reconstructed energy of the combined EMEC and HEC. The energy resolution is found to be slightly better using the cell weighting approach, with the drawback that it requires 52 weight parameters for the EMEC and HEC, compared to only 4 parameters for the cluster weighting approach. Moreover the resolution for positive pions is found to be slightly better than the one for negative pions.

Also shown is the noise contribution to the resolution (open stars) as a function of the reconstructed energies. The lines show the results of the fits (see text).

## Chapter 9 Performance for Pions

Fits to the energy dependence of the intrinsic resolution of the reconstructed pion energy with equation (9.33) yield for the impact point J sampling terms \(a\) between \(79.4\%\sqrt{\mathrm{GeV}}\) and \(84.6\%\sqrt{\mathrm{GeV}}\) and always vanishing constant terms within errors. For the symmetrically located impact point H, see figure 3.11, a similar pion energy resolution is found. As the energy resolution for different impact points is affected by different amounts of energy leakage out of the calorimeter the energy resolution at the impact points H and J cannot be easily compared to the energy resolution at other impact points.

The event by event application of cluster or cell weights substantially improves the resolution of the reconstructed energy with respect to the resolution of the reconstructed energy on the EM scale. Contrary to that the resolution cannot be improved by the application of a single weight factor to compensate for the smaller response of the EMEC and HEC to pion showers. A single weight factor is not able to reflect the event to event fluctuations of the pion shower:

\[E_{\mathrm{reco}}^{\mathrm{const\ weight}}=\mathrm{const}\cdot\left[E_{ \mathrm{EMEC\ clusters}}^{\mathrm{EM\ scale}}+E_{\mathrm{HE\ C\ clusters}}^{\mathrm{EM\ scale}}\right]. \tag{9.34}\]

Figure 9.30 shows the resolution of the reconstructed energy on the EM scale (open gray and black stars for positive and negative pions, respectively) in comparison to the resolution of the reconstructed energy after the cluster weighting (full gray and black stars for positive and negative pions, respectively) as a function of the reconstructed energy using the cluster weighting. The electronics noise is subtracted quadratically from the energy resolution. The broken lines show fits with equation (9.33) to the observed energy resolution on the EM scale and yield sampling terms of about \(100\%\sqrt{\mathrm{GeV}}\) and considerable constant terms of \(3.2\%\) and \(5.7\%\) for positive and negative pions, respectively.

Figure 9.30: Energy dependence of the energy resolution for positive and negative pions on the EM scale (open gray and black stars, respectively) and after the application of the cluster weights (full gray and black stars, respectively) at the impact point J. The event to event weighting considerably improves the resolution. The lines show the results of the fits (see text).

The intrinsic energy resolution of the EMEC and HEC in the combined beam test cannot be easily compared to the intrinsic energy resolution in the HEC stand-alone beam test [7]. In addition to the different detector setup much larger clusters of fixed size were chosen in the prior beam test for the energy reconstruction that contained up to 6 GeV of electronics noise. A fit to the energy dependence of the energy resolution yielded a sampling term of \(a=(70.6\%\pm 1.5\%)\sqrt{\mathrm{GeV}}\) and a sizeable constant term of \(b=(5.8\pm 0.2)\%\). The resolution was found to be only marginally improved by the application of event to event weighting schemes.

In general, the combination of the EMEC and the HEC allows an efficient application of event to event weighting schemes and the intrinsic resolution of the combined EMEC and HEC is better than the resolution of the stand-alone HEC for energies above about 40 GeV. This energy region is of special interest for the future ATLAS experiment.

### 9.5 The \(e/\pi\)-Ratio

A measure of the smaller response of the combined EMEC and HEC to pions than to electrons is given by the \(e/\pi\)-ratio, the ratio between the mean deposited energy in the calorimeter and the mean reconstructed energy on the EM scale. Using the reconstructed clusters the \(e/\pi\)-ratio is given by:

\[\frac{e}{\pi}=\frac{\left\langle E_{\mathrm{clusters}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\right\rangle _{\mathrm{run}}}{\left\langle E_{\mathrm{clusters}}^{\mathrm{EM\ scale}} \right\rangle_{\mathrm{run}}}=\frac{E_{\mathrm{beam}}-\left\langle E_{ \mathrm{leak}}\right\rangle_{\mathrm{run}}}{\left\langle E_{\mathrm{clusters}}^{ \mathrm{EM\ scale}}\right\rangle_{\mathrm{run}}}\, \tag{9.35}\]

where \(\left\langle E_{\mathrm{clusters}}^{\mathrm{EM\ scale}}\right\rangle_{ \mathrm{run}}\) is the mean reconstructed energy on the EM scale in the clusters and \(\left\langle E_{\mathrm{clusters}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\right\rangle_{\mathrm{ run}}\) is the mean reconstructed energy after weighting, which equals the beam energy minus the mean energy deposit beyond the clusters, \(\left\langle E_{\mathrm{leak}}\right\rangle_{\mathrm{run}}\). Therefore the determined \(e/\pi\)-ratio is independent of the particular weighting approach used to reconstruct the deposited energy in the clusters.

Figure 9.31 shows the \(e/\pi\)-ratio for positive and negative pions at the impact point J and for the different MC predictions for negative pions as a function of the beam energy. In the data different \(e/\pi\)-ratios for positive and negative pions are observed and confirmed at different impact points. The reason for this effect is still under investigation. In the moment MC simulations with positive pions are prepared to check whether the simulations also predict a different calorimeter response to positive and negative pions.

For energies above about 40 GeV the \(e/\pi\)-ratio decreases with increasing energy of the incoming particle. Although the MC simulations show a similar energy dependence of the \(e/\pi\)-ratio on the beam energy all simulations predict a lower \(e/\pi\)-ratio than the data, with GEANT 3 being particularly off. This corresponds well to a higher reconstructed energy on the EM scale in the MC simulations than in the data, see figure 9.3, and smaller cluster weight factors, especially in the HEC, see figures 9.12 to 9.14, than in the data.

The energy dependence of the \(e/\pi\)-ratio represents a different composition of the pion shower of electromagnetic sub-showers and purely hadronic interactions for different energies of the incoming pion. As in each interaction of the hadronic shower cascade an electromagnetic sub-shower can be initiated by the production and the electromagnetic decay of a neutral pion, but in an electromagnetic shower no hadrons are produced, the electromagnetic content of the whole pion shower increases with increasing initial energy of the pion. This corresponds to a decreasing \(e/\pi\)-ratio.

From the energy dependence of the \(e/\pi\)-ratio the ratio between the response to electrons and purely hadronic showers, the \(e/h\)-ratio, can be determined [26, 69]. The \(e/h\)-ratio is an intrinsic property of a calorimeter. As the EMEC and HEC are made of different materials they have different intrinsic \(e/h\)-ratios. The \(e/h\)-ratio of the combined EMEC and HEC is a combination of both.

Nevertheless in figure 9.31 fits to the energy dependence of the \(e/\pi\)-ratio with the parameterization [69]:

\[\frac{e}{\pi}=\frac{e/h}{1+(e/h-1)f_{\pi^{0}}}\quad\text{with}\quad f_{\pi^{0 }}=1-\left(\frac{E_{\text{beam}}}{1\text{ GeV}}\right)^{-0.15}\, \tag{9.36}\]

are included as lines of the corresponding color as the data values or MC predictions. The parameterization fits well the energy dependence of the \(e/\pi\)-ratio for the data and the MC predictions at beam energies above about 30 GeV. Effective \(e/h\)-ratios of the combined EMEC / HEC setup between about 1.28 (GEANT3) and about 1.69 (positive pions) are obtained. The different \(e/h\)-ratios closely reflect the different \(e/\pi\)-ratios in the data and the simulations. The interpretation of the \(e/h\)-ratios for the combined EMEC/HEC setup is difficult.

Figure 9.31: The \(e/\pi\)-ratio as a function of the beam energy for positive and negative pions (gray and black stars) together with MC predictions (blue points for GEANT3, green squares and red triangles for GEANT4 LHEP and QGSP, respectively) at the impact point J. The lines show the result of the fit, see text.

### 9.6 Impact of Hadronic Weights on the Energy Reconstruction of Electromagnetic Clusters

The main purpose of any weighting approach is to boost the calorimeter response offline event by event to compensate for the smaller response of the calorimeter to hadrons than to electrons.

For the energy reconstruction of jets in ATLAS it will in general not be possible to distinguish between hadronic and purely electromagnetic energy deposits. Therefore the weighting approach needs also to reconstruct the correct energy for purely electromagnetic energy deposits.

To test this, the derived cluster and cell weights for pions are applied to the energy reconstruction of electrons. Figures 9.32 and 9.33 show the distributions of the reconstructed energies for electrons of 100 GeV at the impact point I after the application of the cluster and cell weights (red histograms) in comparison to reconstructed energies on the EM scale (blue histograms). For both weighting approaches the mean reconstructed energy of the electrons equals the mean reconstructed energy on the EM scale, but the energy resolution after application of the hadronic weights is somewhat deteriorated.

Thus the developed weighting approaches reconstruct on average the true deposited energy independently of a prior identification of the clusters to be of electromagnetic or hadronic origin.

Figure 9.32: Distributions of the reconstructed energy in the EMEC clusters for 100 GeV electrons at the impact point I on the EM scale (blue histogram) and using the cell weights for pions (red histogram). The mean reconstructed energy stays about the same, whereas the resolution is somewhat deteriorated.

The mean reconstructed energy stays about the same, whereas the resolution is slightly deteriorated.

## Chapter 10 Performance for Muons

In order to study the performance of the combined Electromagnetic End-cap Calorimeter (EMEC) and Hadronic End-cap Calorimeter (HEC) for muons, they have been exposed to beams of positive and negative muons of 1 20, 150 and 1 80 GeV at 9 selected impact points, see figure 3.11, and to horizontal and vertical scans with muons of 120 and 150 GeV, see section 7.1.1.

This chapter covers:

* the reconstruction of the muon signal in the EMEC and the HEC
* the signal to noise ratio for muons in the EMEC and the HEC
* the determination of the muon scale factors and the electron to muon ratio of the EMEC and the HEC1.

First the total calorimeter signal is reconstructed from the sum of the ionization signals of all directly hit read-out cells. The distributions of the total muon signals in the EMEC and in the HEC are then compared to the distributions of the electronics noise in the related EMEC and HEC read-out channels.

The spectra of the reconstructed muon signals are compared to predictions of the GEANT4 MC simulation and the muon scale factors, \(\alpha_{\text{EMEC }/\text{ HEC 1}}^{\mu}\), which translate the ionization currents in nA to the deposited energy in GeV, are determined for the EMEC and the HEC1. Finally the \(e/\mu\)-ratio, an intrinsic characteristic of the EMEC and HEC, is derived. All results obtained are compared to the ones obtained in the prior stand-alone beam tests of the EMEC and the HEC [6, 7] and to the predictions from the MC simulations.

### 10.1 Signal Reconstruction

The muon signals are reconstructed using the optimal filter method with the time input from the TDC, see chapter 4. Due to the small muon signals the global cubic event timing cannot be used for the muon reconstruction, see figure 4.7.

Muons in the considered energy range loose only a small part of their energy in the combined EMEC and HEC, mainly due to ionization, see section 2.1.1. This gives rise to an asymmetric probability density function characterized by a narrow peak and a long tail towards high energy deposits, reflecting a rare chance to transfer a large amount of the muon energy in a collision with the absorber electrons, the Landau distribution [70]. The general shape of the Landau distribution, \(L_{\Delta E^{\mathrm{mp}},\xi}(\Delta E)\), can be approximated by [71]:

\[L_{\Delta E^{\mathrm{mp}},\xi}(\Delta E)\approx\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left[ -\frac{1}{2}\left(\lambda+e^{-\lambda}\right)\right]\;,\quad\mathrm{with} \quad\lambda=\frac{\Delta E-\Delta E^{\mathrm{mp}}}{\xi}\;, \tag{10.1}\]

where \(\Delta E\) is the actual energy loss of the muon, \(\Delta E^{\mathrm{mp}}\) is the most probable energy loss and \(\xi\) is a material constant, that describes the width of the distribution.

Muons usually only deposit a sizeable signal in the read-out channel which is directly hit by the muon. Therefore for the reconstruction of the muon signal only those read-out cells are selected which are directly on the muon trajectory. Due to the non-pointing impact of the beams in the EMEC the muons traverse a larger number of EMEC read-out cells than in the ATLAS setup, see figure 7.2. Clusters of \(4\times 2\) cells in \(\eta\times\phi\) in the second and \(1\times 2\) cells in \(\eta\times\phi\) in the third EMEC layer are selected. In the \(\phi\)-direction 2 cells are selected due to the charge sharing between neighboring cells because of the accordion geometry [72]. The muon signal is not reconstructed in the narrow strips in the first EMEC layer.

As the geometry of the HEC is pseudo-pointing, see figure 1.7, the muons traverse between three and five HEC read-out cells. For the further analysis impact points are chosen where the muons deposit energy in only three read-out channels.

The cluster algorithm, as it is used for the electron and pion reconstruction, reconstructs only in about 25 % of the muon events a cluster, which corresponds to exceeding a signal to noise ratio of four in at least one of the read-out channels, see section 6.2. Thus the muon events that yield clusters are biased towards higher signals and therefore the cluster algorithm is not used.

### 10.2 Signal to Noise Ratio

As an example figure 10.1 shows the distribution of the total signal of 150 GeV negative muons at the impact point J in the chosen EMEC cluster (blue histogram) together with the distribution of the electronics noise in the corresponding EMEC cluster (red histogram), evaluated from the total signal of the cluster cells for a muon run at another impact point. The red line represents a Gaussian fit to the noise distribution centered at zero and with a standard deviation of \(\sigma_{\mathrm{EMEC}}^{\mathrm{noise}}=(278\pm 2)\) nA. The muon signal distribution \(\mathcal{P}(I_{\mathrm{EMEC}})\) is fitted well with a convolution of a Landau distribution, \(L_{I_{\mathrm{EMEC}}^{\mathrm{mp}},\ \xi}(I_{\mathrm{EMEC}})\), and the noise Gaussian:

\[\mathcal{P}(I_{\mathrm{EMEC}})=C\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}L_{I_{\mathrm{EMEC}}^{ \mathrm{mp}},\xi}(I_{\mathrm{EMEC}}-a)\cdot\mathcal{N}\left(\frac{a}{\sigma_{ \mathrm{EMEC}}^{\mathrm{noise}}}\right)\mathrm{d}a\;, \tag{10.2}\]where \(\mathcal{N}(x)\) is the Gaussian normal distribution evaluated at the point \(x\) and \(C\) is an overall normalization constant. For the fit a given numeric implementation is used [73].

The fit yields a most probable ionization signal of \(I_{\mathrm{EMEC}}^{\mathrm{mp}}=(727\pm 4)\) nA. This corresponds to a full mean of the muon signal of \(I_{\mathrm{EMEC}}^{\mathrm{mean}}=(135\,3\pm 29)\) nA.

In all, the signal to noise ratio in the EMEC is for the most probable ionization signal \(\frac{I_{\mathrm{EMEC}}^{\mathrm{mp}}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{EMEC}}^{\mathrm{mp}}}= 2.62\pm 0.02\) and for the mean signal: \(\frac{I_{\mathrm{EMEC}}^{\mathrm{mm}}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{EMEC}}^{\mathrm{mm}} }=4.87\pm 0.10\), where the errors given are purely statistical. In the pointing ATLAS setup the signal to noise ratio is expected to be much higher due to the use of smaller clusters. In the pointing beam test of the ATLAS EM barrel calorimeter, see section 1.2.2, a most probable signal to noise ratio of about seven has been obtained [72].

Figure 10.2 shows the distribution of the total signal of 150 GeV negative muons at the impact point K in the chosen HEC cluster (blue histogram) together with the distribution of the electronics noise in the corresponding HEC cluster (red histogram), evaluated from the cluster sum of the optimal filtered signals of the five pedestal time samples, see section 4.5. The impact point K is chosen in order not to be influenced by any of the high-voltage problems in the HEC, see section 7.2. The red line represents a Gaussian fit to the noise distribution centered at zero and with a standard deviation of \(\sigma_{\mathrm{HEC}}^{\mathrm{noise}}=(175\pm 2)\) nA. The muon signal is fitted well with a convolution of a Landau distribution with a most probable signal of \(I_{\mathrm{HE\,C}}^{\mathrm{mp}}=(440\pm 2)\) nA and the Gaussian noise. This corresponds to a full mean of the muon signal of \(I_{\mathrm{HE\,C}}^{\mathrm{mean}}=(732\pm 10)\) nA.

In all, the signal to noise ratio in the HEC is for the most probable value \(\frac{I_{\mathrm{HE\,C}}^{\mathrm{mp}}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{HE\,C}}^{\mathrm{ noise}}}=2.51\pm 0.03\) and for the mean: \(\frac{I_{\mathrm{HE\,C}}^{\mathrm{mm}}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{HE\,C}}^{\mathrm{mm}} }=4.18\pm 0.07\), where the errors given are purely statistical.

The observed signal to noise ratio in the HEC cannot be easily compared to the result of the stand-alone HEC beam test, where a most probable signal to noise value of about 5 has been obtained for 180 GeV muons [7]. In the stand-alone beam test full HEC 2 modules were used, yielding a higher muon signal. Moreover different electronics have been utilized for the signal read-out, see section 3.6.2.

### 10.3 Comparison of Data and Monte Carlo Predictions

The purpose for the comparison of the observed ionization currents in the data with MC predictions, see chapter 5, is two-fold: On the one hand, it is verified that the simulated spectra of the muon energy deposits in the EMEC and in the HEC agree with the observed spectra in the data. On the other hand, the MC predictions are the only source of information about the total energy deposit of the muons. Therefore dedicated MC simulations have been carried out: They do not only predict the deposited energy in each read-out cell in the active liquid argon, but also in the absorbers of the EMEC and the HEC [67]. This information is then used to derive the muon scale factor, \(\alpha^{\mu}_{\mathrm{EMEC\ /\ HE\ 1}}\), which converts the observed ionization current for muons into the deposited energy.

The MC predictions of energy deposits in the same clusters as used for the signal reconstruction in the data, \(E^{\mathrm{MC\ /\ HEC\ 1}}_{\mathrm{EMEC\ /\ HE\ 1}}\) are transferred into predicted currents, \(I^{\mathrm{MC\ /\ HE\ 1}}_{\mathrm{EMEC\ /\ HE\ 1}}\) using the muon scale factors \(\alpha^{\mu}_{\mathrm{EMEC\ /\ }}\) and \(\alpha^{\mu}_{\mathrm{HE\ 1}}\) and adding the corresponding Gaussian electronics noise of the clusters:

\[I^{\mathrm{MC\ /\ HE\ 1}}_{\mathrm{EMEC\ /\ HE\ 1}}=\alpha^{\mu}_{\mathrm{EMEC\ /\ HE\ 1}}\cdot E^{\mathrm{MC\ /\ HE\ 1}}_{\mathrm{EMEC\ /\ HE\ 1}}+\sigma^{\mathrm{noise\ }}_{\mathrm{EMEC\ /\ HE\ 1}}\cdot\mathcal{N}\, \tag{10.3}\]

Figure 10.2: Distribution of the reconstructed signal in the HEC of 150 GeV negative muons at the impact point K (blue histogram) together with the distribution of the electronics noise in the muon cluster (red histogram). The lines show fits to the related distributions, see text.

where \(\mathcal{N}\) is a Gaussian normal distributed random number. As the HEC1 and the HEC2 have different sampling ratios, see section 1.2.2, the muon signal is only reconstructed in the HEC1 modules (first and second longitudinal read-out layer of the HEC).

The muon scale factors, \(\alpha^{\mu}_{\text{E\"{HEC}}\;/\;\text{HEC1}}\), are determined from the ratio of the most probable predicted energy deposit, \(E^{\text{mp, MC}}_{\text{E\"{HEC}}\;/\;\text{HEC1}}\), and the most probable ionization current, \(I^{\text{mp}}_{\text{E\"{HEC}}\;/\;\text{HEC1}}\), see section 10.2:

\[\alpha^{\mu}_{\text{E\"{HEC}}\;/\;\text{HEC1}}=\frac{E^{\text{mp, MC}}_{\text{E\"{HEC}}\;/\;\text{HEC1}}}{I^{\text{mp}}_{\text{E\"{HEC}}\;/\; \text{HEC1}}}, \tag{10.4}\]

The following muon scale factors are found:

\[\alpha^{\mu}_{\text{E\"{HEC}}\;/\;\text{HEC1}}=(3.094\pm 0.010)\cdot 10^{-4} \frac{\text{GeV}}{\text{nA}}\qquad\alpha^{\mu}_{\text{H\"{HEC}}\;/\;\text{HEC 1}}=(3.33\pm 0.01)\cdot 10^{-3}\frac{\text{GeV}}{\text{nA}}\, \tag{10.5}\]

where the given errors are purely statistical. Using the mean ionization currents and predicted energies in equation (10.4) would yield compatible muon scale factors. In the HEC there is a considerable cross-talk between neighboring read-out cells of about \((4\pm 2)\%\) of the cell-signal [39, 41]. As only one single read-out cell per HEC layer is used to reconstruct the muon signal, one has to correct for the cross-talk effect, to get the intrinsic muon scale factor of the HEC1:

\[\alpha^{\mu,\;\text{intrinsic}}_{\text{H\"{HEC}}\;1}=(3.20\pm 0.01\pm 0.07)\cdot 1 0^{-3}\frac{\text{GeV}}{\text{nA}}\, \tag{10.6}\]

where the first error is the statistical error and the second one is due to the uncertainty in the size of the cross-talk.

Figures 10.3 and 10.4 show the distributions of the total ionization signals in the EMEC (layers two and three) and HEC1 (layers one and two) clusters (blue histograms) in comparison to the predicted signals from the GEANT4 LHEP simulation (red histograms). In all, for the EMEC as well as for the HEC1, a good agreement between the data and the MC predictions is found. As the different hadronic shower codes in the GEANT4 MC simulations do not have any influence in the muon energy loss by ionization or bremsstrahlung, all GEANT4 hadronic physics lists yield the same predictions.

### 10.4 The \(e/\mu\)-ratio

The \(e/\mu\)-ratio is an intrinsic property of a given calorimeter and equals the ratio of the calorimeter response to electrons and muons for the same total deposited energy. Thus the \(e/\mu\)-ratios of the EMEC and the HEC1 are given by the ratios between the scale factors for muons, \(\alpha^{\mu}_{\text{E\"{HEC}}\;/\;\text{HEC1}}\); and the electromagnetic scale factors, \(\alpha^{\text{EM}}_{\text{E\"{HEC}}\;/\;\text{HEC1}}\):

Figure 10.3: Distributions of the reconstructed signal in the EMEC layers 2 and 3 for 150 GeV negative muons at the impact point J (blue histogram) and MC predictions for the total muon energy deposit (absorbers plus liquid argon) in the EMEC cluster (red histogram), scaled to units of current using \(\alpha_{\text{EMEC}}^{\mu}\) and after addition of the same Gaussian noise as found in the data.

Using the obtained electromagnetic scale factors of the EME C, \(\alpha_{\rm EME\,C}^{\rm EM}=(0.3855\pm 0.0004\pm 0.0058)\frac{\rm MeV}{\rm nA}\), see section 8.3, and of the HEC1, \(\alpha_{\rm HE\,C1}^{\rm EM}=(3.266\pm 0.065)\frac{\rm MeV}{\rm nA}\), the \(e/\mu\)-ratios are given by:

\[\left(\frac{e}{\mu}\right)_{\rm EME\,C}=0.803\pm 0.003\pm 0.012;\qquad\left( \frac{e}{\mu}\right)_{\rm HE\,C1}=0.98\pm 0.01\pm 0.04\, \tag{10.8}\]

where the first errors denote the statistical errors and the second ones the systematic errors. The \(e/\mu\) ratio of the EME C is not corrected for potential cross-talk effects between the EMEC channels.

The obtained \(e/\mu\)-ratio of the HEC1 is compatible within errors with the value of \(0.93\pm 0.02\), which was found in HEC stand-alone beam tests for 150 GeV muons [7]. An \(e/\mu\)-ratio of the EME C from stand-alone beam tests has not been published yet. In the pointing stand-alone beam test of the ATLAS electromagnetic barrel calorimeter with a similar accordion geometry as the EME C an \(e/\mu\)-ratio of \(0.75\pm 0.03\) was found [72].

In analogy to the electromagnetic scale factor, \(\alpha_{\rm EME\,C}^{\rm EM,\,MC}/\,{\rm HEC1}^{\rm,\,MC}\), of the MC simulation, which converts the visible energy in the liquid argon, into the total deposited energy for an electromagnetic shower, see section 5.5, also a muon scale factor, \(\alpha_{\rm EME\,C}^{\mu,\,MC}/\,{\rm HEC1}\), can be defined for the MC simulations:

\[\alpha_{\rm EME\,C}^{\mu,\,MC}/\,{\rm HEC1}=\frac{E_{\rm EME\,C}^{\rm mp,\, MC}/\,{\rm HEC1}^{\rm mp,\,MC}}{E_{\rm EME\,C}^{\rm mp,\,MC}/\,{\rm HEC1,\,vis}^{ \rm mp,\,MC}}\, \tag{10.9}\]

where \(E_{\rm EME\,C}^{\rm mp,\,MC}/\,{\rm HEC1}\) is the most probable predicted total deposited energy (in the absorber and in the liquid argon) in the EME C/HEC1 cluster and \(E_{\rm EME\,C}^{\rm mp,\,MC}/\,{\rm HEC1,\,vis}^{\rm mp,\,MC}\) is the most probable predicted visible energy deposit in the liquid argon only.

The MC predictions of the \(e/\mu\)-ratios are than given by the ratios between the muon and the electromagnetic scale factors of the MC simulations according to equation (10.7). The GEANT4 MC simulations yield \(e/\mu\)-ratios of:

\[\left(\frac{e}{\mu}\right)_{\rm EME\,C}^{\rm MC}=0.69\pm 0.01\qquad\left( \frac{e}{\mu}\right)_{\rm HE\,C1}^{\rm MC}=0.92\pm 0.01. \tag{10.10}\]

The GEANT3 MC simulation predicted in the case of the stand-alone HEC beam test an \(e/\mu\)-ratio for the HEC of 0.91 \(\pm\) 0.01.

Although the predicted \(e/\mu\)-ratio for the HEC1 is compatible with the measured value within errors, the MC simulations tend to predict smaller \(e/\mu\)-ratios for the EME C and for the HEC1 than the one obtained from the data. This corresponds to a smaller observed response, especially of the EME C, than predicted from the simulations. Part of this effect might be due to cross-talk effects, but also a non-optimal reconstruction of small signals, especially in the EME C, could contribute.

## Chapter 11 Conclusions and Outlook

The Electromagnetic and Hadronic End-cap Calorimeter modules are successfully combined in the 2002 beam test. The whole calibration chain from the discrete measured ionization signal samples to the reconstructed energy for electrons, pions and muons is studied. All necessary calibration constants are determined with a good precision and the energy resolution of the combined EMEC and HEC meets the expectations from former stand-alone beam tests.

The ionization signal amplitude and time is reconstructed for all read-out channels by the optimal filtering method. A novel approach for the essential signal timing as an input into the optimal filter, the global cubic event timing, was developed and applied to the electron and pion data. For each read-out channel two timing constants are determined, which account for different cable delays in the calibration and read-out circuits.

The whole signal reconstruction was implemented and done in the ATLAS common object-oriented ATHENA framework. The EMEC/HEC combined beam test is the first use of ATHENA for beam test analysis.

The ionization signals in the EMEC and HEC read-out channels are combined event by event to two dimensional clusters using a topological neighboring criterion to suppress random electronics noise, whereas in prior stand-alone beam tests fixed size clusters have been used. The clusters serve as an input for all further analysis of the electron and pion data, especially for the energy and position reconstruction.

The relative positions of the calorimeter modules with respect to their nominal positions are determined from the data and used as input for a detailed simulation of the beam test setup with the Monte Carlo technique. The influence of high voltage problems in the response of the HEC is corrected for. The developed correction techniques are also applicable to detect and correct possible problems in the future ATLAS setup.

### 11.1 Electron Results

The total ionization signals of electrons are reconstructed in the EMEC using the event to event varying clusters. The total signal is corrected for its dependence on the reconstructed impact position in \(\phi\) due to local non-uniformities of the electric field and a varyingsampling fraction because of the accordion geometry and its residual dependence on the signal timing because of a non-optimal parameterization of the signal shape.

Thereafter the electromagnetic scale factor \(\,\alpha_{\mathrm{EMEC}}^{\mathrm{EM}}\) is determined:

\[\alpha_{\mathrm{EMEC}}^{\mathrm{EM}}=(\,3.855\pm 0.004)\cdot 10^{-4}\,\frac{ \mathrm{GeV}}{\mathrm{nA}}\quad\mathrm{for}\quad\phi_{\mathrm{norm}}\in[-0.5;-0. 46]\, \tag{11.1}\]

where the error quoted is purely statistical. The linearity of the EMEC response is assessed to be within \(\pm 0.5\%\). Nevertheless the spatial uniformity of the EMEC response deviates up to \(\pm 1.5\%\), which is mainly due to channel calibration differences.

The energy resolution of the EMEC to electrons is typically obtained to be:

\[\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{(12.1\pm 0.2)\%}{\sqrt{E/\mathrm{GeV}}}\oplus(0.4\pm 0.1)\%\oplus\frac{\langle\sigma_{\mathrm{noise}}\rangle(E)}{E}\, \tag{11.2}\]

with typical electronics noise values \(\langle\sigma_{\mathrm{noise}}\rangle\) between 200 and 300 MeV. The GEANT 3 (GEANT 4) simulations yield a slightly better (worse) energy resolution.

### 11.2 Pion Results

For the reconstruction of the pion energy two signal weighting approaches are developed, based on the whole EMEC and HEC clusters:

\[E_{\mathrm{reco}}=w_{\mathrm{EMEC}}\,(\rho_{\mathrm{EMEC}},E_{\mathrm{beam}}) \,E_{\mathrm{EMEC~{}clusters}}^{\mathrm{EM~{}scale}}+w_{\mathrm{HEC}}\,(\rho_{ \mathrm{HEC}},E_{\mathrm{beam}})\,E_{\mathrm{HEC~{}clusters}}^{\mathrm{EM~{} scale}}\, \tag{11.3}\]

or based on the single read-out cells inside the clusters:

\[E^{\mathrm{reco}}=\sum_{\begin{subarray}{c}\mathrm{EMEC~{}/~{}HEC}\\ \mathrm{cluster~{}cells}\end{subarray}}w_{\mathrm{EMEC~{}/~{}HEC}}^{\mathrm{ cell}}\,(\rho_{\mathrm{EMEC~{}/~{}HEC~{}cell}},E_{\mathrm{beam}})\,E_{\mathrm{EMEC~{}/~{}HEC~{} cell}}^{\mathrm{EM~{}scale}}. \tag{11.4}\]

The reconstructed pion signal on the electromagnetic scale is multiplied by weighting factors that compensate offline for the smaller response of the EMEC and HEC to pions compared to electrons. The weighting takes into account the event to event fluctuations of the composition of the pion shower of electromagnetic and purely hadronic parts.

Applying the weighting methods to the beam test data the energy resolution of negative pions can be typically determined to be:

\[\mathrm{cluster~{}weights}: \frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{(84.6\pm 0.3)\%}{\sqrt{E/\mathrm{GeV}}} \oplus(0\pm 0.2)\%\oplus\frac{\langle\sigma_{\mathrm{noise}}\rangle(E)}{E} \tag{11.5}\] \[\mathrm{cell~{}weights}: \frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{(80.7\pm 0.4)\%}{\sqrt{E/\mathrm{GeV}}} \oplus(0\pm 0.3)\%\oplus\frac{\langle\sigma_{\mathrm{noise}}\rangle(E)}{E}\, \tag{11.6}\]with typical electronics noise values \(\langle\sigma_{\text{noise}}\rangle\) between 1.0 and 1.6 GeV. The vanishing constant terms are signs for achieved compensation with both weighting approaches. The energy resolution is clearly improved compared to the energy resolution without weighting of typically \(\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{\left[98.4\pm 0.8\right]\%}{\sqrt{E\,/\,\text{GeV}}} \oplus(5.7\pm 0.1)\%\oplus\frac{\langle\sigma_{\text{noise}}\rangle(E)}{E}\).

The response of the EMEC and HEC is not optimally described in the MC simulations. Especially the intrinsic level of non-compensation in the EMEC and HEC is non-optimally modeled.

### 11.3 Muon Results

Muons are reconstructed with a mean signal to noise ratio of \(4.87\pm 0.10\) and \(4.18\pm 0.07\) in the EMEC and in the HEC, respectively. The signal to noise ratio is substantially deteriorated by the non-pointing beam test layout.

The relative response of the EMEC and HEC to electrons normalized to the response to muons is determined to be:

\[\left(\frac{e}{\mu}\right)_{\text{EMEC}}=0.803\pm 0.003\pm 0.012\,\qquad\left( \frac{e}{\mu}\right)_{\text{HEC1}}=0.98\pm 0.01\pm 0.04\, \tag{11.7}\]

where the first errors denote the statistical errors and the second ones the systematic errors.

The observed muon signal distributions in the EMEC and HEC agree well with the MC prediction, nevertheless the simulations predict slightly smaller \(e/\mu\)-ratios.

### 11.4 Outlook: Use of the beam test results in ATLAS

The applied calibration and reconstruction methods for the ionization signal amplitude and time in the beam tests can be directly used in ATLAS.

The introduced clustering algorithm is also applicable in ATLAS, it will be extended to three dimensional clusters across the sub-detector boundaries. The deposited energy inside the clusters will be reconstructed using the determined electromagnetic scale constants in the beam tests. The EMEC signal will be corrected for its \(\phi\)-dependence.

The developed weighting algorithms can be directly used in ATLAS to reconstruct the energy of single isolated pions. The energy reconstruction of jets will also employ a weighting approach. As jets are not accessible in beam tests the weighting approach for jets has to be based on detailed MC simulations.

The present MC simulations deviate substantially from the data for hadronic showers. As the reconstruction algorithms for jets in ATLAS have to be derived from detailed MC simulations, the simulations have to be tuned to optimally describe hadronic showers in the EMEC and HEC. Therefore the found differences between the pion data and the MC predictions in the beam tests serve as an input.

## Appendix A Theory of Optimal Filtering

The goal of the optimal filtering method [38, 74, 75] is to optimally reconstruct the amplitude and time origin of a signal with a known signal shape from discrete measurements of the signal. Thereby the noise contribution to the amplitude reconstruction is minimized.

For the optimal filtering method two assumptions have to be made:

* The normalized signal shape has to be independent of the signal amplitude.
* The noise properties have to be independent of the signal amplitude.

Let \(g(t)\) be the normalized signal shape, \(E\) the signal amplitude and \(\tau\) the time shift of the physical signal from the predicted signal shape. Then the time dependence of the signal, \(y(t)\), is given by:

\[y(t)=E\cdot g(t-\tau)+b(t)\;,\] (A.1)

where \(b(t)\) is the time dependent noise distribution. For small time shifts \(\tau\) the time dependence can be linearized by the use of a Taylor expansion:

\[y(t)=E\cdot g(t)-E\tau\cdot\dot{g}(t)+b(t)\;,\] (A.2)

where \(\dot{g}(t)\) is the time derivative of the signal shape. Discrete measurements \(y_{i}\) of the signal at times \(t_{i}\) (\(i=1,...,n\)) have the form:

\[y_{i} =E\cdot g_{i}-E\tau\cdot\dot{g}_{i}+b_{i}\;.\] (A.3)

The correlation of the noise contributions at times \(t_{i}\) and \(t_{j}\) is expressed in the noise autocorrelation matrix \(B\):

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:150]

## Appendix A Theory of Optimal Filtering

The expected contribution of the noise to the estimated amplitude, \(\sigma_{E}\), is:

\[\sigma_{E}^{2} = \frac{\dot{\boldsymbol{g}}^{T}\boldsymbol{B}^{-1}\dot{\boldsymbol {g}}}{(\boldsymbol{g}^{T}\boldsymbol{B}^{-1}\boldsymbol{g})(\dot{\boldsymbol {g}}^{T}\boldsymbol{B}^{-1}\dot{\boldsymbol{g}})-(\dot{\boldsymbol{g}}^{T} \boldsymbol{B}^{-1}\boldsymbol{g})^{2}}\.\] (A.13)

In the case of an uncorrelated noise with zero mean the noise autocorrelation matrix is:

\[\boldsymbol{B}_{i\,j}=\langle b_{i}b_{j}\rangle\delta_{i\,j}=\sigma^{2}(b_{i} )\,\] (A.14)

where \(\sigma(b_{i})\) is the standard deviation of the noise of the discrete measurements. Equation (A.13) than becomes:

\[\frac{\sigma^{2}(b_{i})}{\sigma_{E}^{2}}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}g_{i}^{2}-\frac{\sum_{ i\,=1}^{n}g_{i}\dot{g}_{i}}{\sum_{i\,=1}^{n}\dot{g}_{i}^{2}}\.\] (A.15)

The noise reduction factor increases with the number of samples, \(n\), and depends on the pulse shape \(g(t)\) and the positions of the samples \(g_{i}\) relative to the shape. In the ATLAS case with only electronic noise and \(n=5\) signal samples, the reduction factor is expected to be around 1.7 [74]:

\[\frac{\sigma(b_{i})}{\sigma_{E}}\approx 1.7\.\] (A.16)

In the case of a flat signal \(g(t)=\) const the reduction factor equals the square root of the number of measurements:

\[\frac{\sigma(\,b_{i}\,)}{\sigma_{E}}=\sqrt{\,5}\.\] (A.17)List of Figures
