PROTVINO 19931. INTRODUCTION

A large-surface muon tracking system almost automatically requires for using of drift-based devices (tubes or Chambers) with large length of sense wires. For long wires the question of gravitational sag arises. The usual soiution is the using of supports arranged along wire with step of 1-2 m. So, it needs some frame which has flat surface, which is rigid, temperature stable etc. To reduce the requirements to such frame another approach can be proposed\({}^{/1}\), when wires of drift chamber are fixed at the ends only and the gravitational sag must be taken account of computation while electrostatic deflections of wires are minimized.

The work is continuation of this idea. We constructed and tested the jet-cell drift chamber with 6-meter unsupported wires. Below is brief description of the chamber and test results.

2. CONSTRUCTION

The sense part of the tested jet-cell is shown in fig.1. It includes 4 sense, 2 guard and 14 cathode wires. The sense wires are alternatively staggered (\(\pm\)0.3 mm) in drift direction. In orthogonal direction the distance between sense wires is 10 mm. They are made of 60 \(\mu\)m tungsten with tension 650\(\pm\)10 g. All other wires are made of stainless steel with diameter 100 \(\mu\)m and tension 1000\(\pm\)35 g. Table 1 contents main properties of used wires.

Between sense wires the pair of cathode wires is placed. The paired cathode wires makes sense part of jet-cell more stable against electrostatic deflection as compare to single cathode wire between sense wires. This is the main feature of the tested cell. The distance between cathode wires in a pair was 5 mm, but it should be decreased, as one can see in fig 3.

Two drift gaps which are created by wires with graded potential are coupled to sense part to form drift cell. The graded potential wires have tension 1000+95 g (stainless steel, 100 \(\mu\)m). The cell is inclosed into the round tube with internal diameter 96 mm (fig.2 ). The trapezoidal shape of drift gaps is caused by circular cross section of the tube. The potentials of field wires were optimized to obtain uniform electric field about of 500 V/cm in drift gap.

The length of wires is 6 m, there are not any supports inside tube. The wires are fixed only at the ends of tube by means of crimping technique with precision of \(\pm\)80 \(\mu\)m (maximal error). Three windows in tube wall have been made to perform optical measurements of wires and X-ray test. Two windows are near the ends of tube and one is in the middle of tube. The window extends about one quarter of cross section and 10 mm along tube.

Two positive high voltages are applied to the cell: one for the sense wires (Us) and another (Ud) for the top of divider chain which is used for creation of graded potential of field shaping wires.

3. GAS

The mixture of Ar+6%002 was used to filling the chamber. The choice of the mixture is caused by our large and successful experience with such gas, 1ts cheapness and safety. In such mixture with small fraction of quencher efficiency plateau is not large. It is equal about 70-100V when multi-hit electronics is used. The drift velocity (fig.4) is not saturated. But the advantage of the mixture is considerable low voltages applied to the chamber.

4.ELECTRONICS

The amplifiers of drift chambers of IHEP-JINR neutrino detector with threshold 1\(\mu\)A are used to readout signals from sense wires. After amplification signals are transmitted to TDC through twisted pair of 60m length. The amplifier has four channels but to exclude cross talks the single amplifier plate was used for each wire and twisted pairs were shielded by screen. TDC can detect two hits per trigger and has bin width about of 0.6 ns.

5.0OSMIC-RAY TEST RESULTS

The cosmic ray test setup is schematically shown in fig.5(a). The cosmic track trigger was selected by coincidence of signals from 3 scintillation counters of 1.1 m length without any restriction of soft cosmic-rays.

The examples of some typical events as they are seen in the cell are given in fig.6, where all wires (open cycles), sense wire hits (crosses) and reconstructed track (dotted line) are depicted. Sense wire hits are shown together with mirror ones. Fig.6(a) shows the event with single hit per wire; fig.6(b) gives the event with one extra hit detected by the second wire. Two-track events are presented in fig.6(c) and 6(d), where the second track is reconstructed by three hits. In fig.6(c) the second hit of wire #4 is not measured due to amplifier dead time. In fig.6(d) after the fist track the extra hit arises on wire #2 and the hit due to the second track was not detected by the wire because of the limited hit capability of electronics. Secondary hits are caused by delta-rays, many-track events (cosmic showers), tails of drifting electrons and noise.

We defined the wire efficiency as a number of wire hits in coincidence with trigger during 1 \(\mu\)s gate normalized to number of triggers, thus Eff=Nw/Ntrig. Such values were measured for the first hit and the second one (fig.7). The probability of the second hit is about of 10-12% on the plateau. The high voltage limit of plateau is caused by sharp increasing of secondary pulse probability.

The curves in fig.7 were measured for two positions of scintillation counters along wire. The fist is near amplifier _=1,15 m) and the second at the far end of tube (L=5.15 m). The two types of matching of wire far end were tested: R=250 \(\alpha\) and R = \(\infty\). The shift of counters from readout end of wire towards far end (dL is 5 m) gives reduction of plateau efficiency to about of 25V for R=250 \(\alpha\).

To test resolution of single wire we selected events with single hit per wire and calculated two values:

D2=(X1+X3)/2-X2 and D3=(X2+X4)/2-X3,

where Xi is a coordinate measured by wire including the staggering, 1 is a number of wire. The line relation of t(x) was used. The resolution of a single wire is equal to width of distribution of D2 (or D3) divided by (3/2)\({}^{1/2}\) if contributions of all wires are same. A example of distribution of D2 is shown in fig.8, where the histogram is sum for all tracks with absolute value of angle less than 15\({}^{0}\). The scintillation counters were shifted to eliminate right drift gap so that the mean coordinate for all tracks was about of half of largest drift distance. The dotted curve is gaussian with \(\sigma\)=280 \(\mu\)m and mean 2 \(\mu\)m. Similar histograms were obtained for 2-mm coordinate intervals to extract x-dependence. The results are shown in fig.9 for the resolution of single wire (a) and for the systematics (b) which is the mean of gaussian for D2 and D3. Mean value of single wire resolution is 240 \(\mu\)m. The systematics (fig.9(b)) is caused mainly by nonlinearity of TDG in range corresponding to 0-10 mm.

The angle dependence of single wire resolution (a) and systematics (b) are shown in fig.10. The values were derived from D2 and D3 distributions when track coordinate was within of interval 6<x<30 mm. The resolution and systematics are changing for the worse when angle becomes greater than 25\({}^{0}\).

6. X-RAY TEST

The X-ray test arrangement is schematically presented in fig.5(b). The X-ray source produces the pulses with duration of 15 ns at the 0.1 level. The spectrum of source was not measured but it is known that it consists of characteristic lines of Cu ( about 5 keV) plus bremsstrahlung continuum up to value defined by anode voltage of X-tube which was not greater than 20 kV. The frequency of pulses can be up 50 Hz. The width of collimator was 0.5 mm. The position of X-ray beam could be changed with respect of sense wires by means of movable platform where the source hasbeen assembled.

The ionization created by such source is different from one of particle track. For single X-ray conversion it represents the "blob" with diameter about several hundreds microns and total number of electron-ion pairs up to thousand. The probability of conversion could be changed and in the test it was less then 30% per one pulse per 1 cm of drift chamber gas.

The example of drift time distribution for two positions of X-ray beam at distance difference of 10 mm is shown in fig.11. The shape of distribution for fixed beam coordinate has long tail that is caused by U-shaped drift time distribution and the feature of X-ray ionization. The drift time spectrum without tail was fitted by gaussian. The example of such fit is shown in fig.11 by dots for the second peak. The sigma of the fit curve is about of 0.5 mm that corresponds to width of collimator and duration time of beam.

The dependence of time versus distance was measured when X-ray beam has been moved across drift gap (fig.12). The line fit was done for 6<x<35 mm and deviation measured t(x) as a function of distance from wire is presented in fig.13. The large deviation near wire may be caused by!) the specific feature of ionization; 2) TDC nonlinearity; 3) drift velocity dependence near wire. But we think that the first is dominant.

The counting rate of X-ray as a function of drift distance is shown in fig.14. The counting rate dependence on number of sense wire is caused by beam attenuation and difference of electron collection range width due to wire staggering. The shadows of wires are seen as small decreasing of counting rate. In principle such shadows can be used to measure wires position.

7. INFLUENCE OF TUBE CURVATURE

A tube curvature will change relative positions of wires in respect of tube wall. So, a tube curvature will give displacement of wires and change electric field strength in drift gap. It can be a reason of systematic errors of the drift chamber.

To test the question we simulated tube curvature by means of movement of middle tube support as it is shown in fig.15(a). The fig.15(b) and fig.15(c) give examples and explain the definitions "horizontal" (b) and "vertical" (c) tube curvature. The first is simulated by support movement (Cr) parallel to drift direction in cell and the second (Gy) is one perpendicular to drift direction. A middle support shift 1s the measure of tube curvature. When we shall say "tube curvature" it means the middle support shift and corresponds to a sag in about the middle of the tube. Our test was only relevant. The zero curvature corresponds to the dotted tube in fig.15(b,c).

The optical measurements showed that sense wires displacement due to tube curvature is less than 2 \(\mu\)m per! mm of tube support shift (fig.16). The field wires which are marked by letters "A","B",...,"G" in fig.2 are more sensitive to tube curvature (fig.17). They can be displaced up to 10 \(\mu\)m/mm.

To determinate the systematic shift of measured coordinate due to tube curvature we used the X-ray setup. The change of mean value of gaussian fit of drift time distribution was measured as a function of tube curvature for fixed position of X-ray beam with respect of end tube supports. The results are presented in fig.18 for drift distance 7.5 mm (a), 21 mm (b), 33 mm (c) for horizontal tube curvature and for x=33mm with vertical curvature (d). The influence of drift distance is more clearly seen in fig.19. From such data the mean coordinate shift per! mm of tube curvature was extracted (Table 2).

The mean shift of the external wires (#! and #4) is dependent of sense wire voltage (fig.20). The middle wires (#2,#3) are less affected by change of voltage.

8.CONCLUSION

The jet-cell drift chamber with 6 m wire successfully operates without any intermediate supports and with the simplest gas mixture Ar/C02(94/6). The efficiency plateau is about 100 V and its reduction due to attenuation pulse propagating along wire is about 25 V for dL=5 m. The high voltage limit of plateau is caused by sharp increasing of number of secondary pulses. The single wire resolution varies from 180 to 320 \(\mu\)m in the drift gap and mean value is 240 \(\mu\)m. The resolution is almost independent of a track angle for angles less than 25 degree. The systematic shift of measured coordinate induced by tube curvature is about 20 \(\mu\)m per 1mm of the tube sag for middle of drift gap and about 50 \(\mu\)m/mm at the largest drift distance. The shift is caused by field wires displacement and change of electric field in the drift gap. The displacement of sense wires due to tube curvature is negligible.

9.DISCUSSION AND PLANS

There are some questions which will have to be answered.

The first one is a reason of large constant fraction of single wire resolution (fig.9(a)). The possible explanations are large fluctuations of avalanche in used mixture or electronics contribution. Some clarification will arise when voltage dependence of resolution will be measured.

The second question is two-track separation. In the performed test it was limited by amplifier. A two-hit resolution for single wire was about of 7-8mm due to duration of output amplifier pulse.

The third one is concern of a coordinate along wire. The development of electronics is need to test the such possibility.

The tested chamber is not suitable to work in magnetic field.

The possible solution is following. We can conserve the sense part of cell, change the shape of drift gap and enclose the chamber into a rectangular tube.
