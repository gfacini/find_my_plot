# Identification of hadronically-decaying top quarks using UFO jets with ATLAS in Run 2

The ATLAS Collaboration

The identification of hadronically-decaying top quarks with large transverse momenta plays an important role for the ATLAS physics programme at the Large Hadron Collider. This note presents the development and performance of tagging algorithms aiming at identifying large-radius jets originating from top quark decays in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV. The taggers described in this note are designed for large-radius jets reconstructed from Unified Flow Objects, a new particle-flow-like algorithm; which takes into account information from the calorimeter as well as the inner detector. The performance of the new taggers is compared to taggers defined with jets reconstructed only from calorimeter information that were widely used within ATLAS throughout Run 1 and Run 2. In addition, a new truth labelling criteria is defined to select jets that contain the full decay of the top quark.

## 1 Introduction

The reconstruction and identification of boosted objects decaying hadronically is a key part of the physics programmes for the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1]. In particular, the identification of boosted massive particles, such as \(W\), \(Z\) and Higgs bosons and top quarks can enhance the sensitivity of searches for physics beyond the Standard Model [2; 3; 4] and can be used to perform precision Standard Model measurements in previously unexplored kinematic regimes [5; 6]. Large-radius (large-\(R\)) jets are used to fully reconstruct the hadronic decay modes of these massive particles and taggers exploring the inner structure of the jets are designed to distinguish signal jets, i.e. jets originated from the decay of a massive particles from light quark/gluon-initiated (background) jets.

The ATLAS Collaboration has recently performed an extensive optimisation of the reconstruction of large-\(R\) jets by comparing different inputs to jet reconstruction, constituent-level pileup mitigation techniques and various grooming algorithms [7]. A new type of particle-flow inputs was constructed, called "Unified Flow Objects" (UFOs) that uses calorimeter and tracking information and was found to outperform large-\(R\) trimmed jets solely reconstructed from calorimeter information in terms of their pile-up stability, jet mass resolution and tagging performance.

This note presents the latest developments of top taggers based on advanced machine-learning techniques using large-\(R\) UFO jets groomed with the soft-drop algorithm. More details on the jet definition are given in Section 3. Two new taggers are defined based on hadronic jet properties to identify top quark decays that are fully contained in the large-\(R\) jet and for top quarks regardless of their decay product containment. A new truth label is introduced in this note to define fully contained top-jets and to improve upon previous definitions which exhibited large variations in the efficiency of labelling a top-jet as contained for different MC generators. Boosted top taggers based on a different large-\(R\) collection were already developed by ATLAS and are described in detail in Refs. [8; 9]. The performance of top taggers defined for large-\(R\) UFO jets is compared to the results obtained in Refs. [9] in terms of their background rejection for fixed signal efficiency working points. Furthermore the performance of these new taggers is compared between samples obtained from different Monte Carlo event generators.

The content of this note is organized as follows: a description of the simulated Monte Carlo samples is given in Section 2 and details about the large-\(R\) jet reconstruction are provided in Section 3. The description of the new top truth labelling strategy and the comparison to previous labelling strategies are given in Section 4. The definition of the top taggers for UFO jets and their performance are summarised in Section 5 and their performance is compared in Section 6 between various Monte Carlo generators, used to simulate signal and background jets. Concluding remarks are given in Section 7.

## 2 Monte Carlo simulated samples

The top taggers described in this note are designed and optimised using samples produced with Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of \(pp\) collisions with a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The MC simulated samples were all passed through a detailed simulation of the ATLAS detector1 based on GEANT4 [10]. The effectof _pile-up_, additional \(pp\) collisions in the same and nearby bunch crossings, is modelled by overlaying simulated inelastic interactions on the generated hard-scatter interactions. The inelastic interactions are generated with Pythia 8.186 [11] using the NNPDF2.3lo set of parton distribution functions (PDF) [12] and the A3 set of tuned parameters [13]. The pile-up profile used for these studies corresponds to the one recorded in 2017 \(pp\) collisions with an average interactions per bunch crossing of 37.8.

The MC signal sample containing high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) hadronically decaying top-quarks are obtained from a physics process modelling phenomena beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Sequential standard model [14]\(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) events are simulated at leading order (LO) using the Pythia 8.235 [15] generator with the NNPDF2.3LO PDF set and the ATLAS A14 set of tuned parameters is used for the parton shower and multi-parton interactions (MPI). This sample is generated with a resonance mass of 2 and the cross-section is reweighted to produce a flat distribution of jets with \(200\GeV<p_{\mathrm{T}}<3\) to populate the kinematic region of interest and to train the taggers described in Section 5.

In order to study modelling effects on the top tagger performance, different \(t\bar{t}\) MC samples are used. The Powheg Box v2 [16, 17, 18, 19] generator is used to produce \(t\bar{t}\) events at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the NNPDF3.0nlo[20] PDF set and the \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) parameter2 set to \(1.5\times m_{\mathrm{top}}\)[21], where \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) is the mass of the top quark. The events were interfaced to Pythia 8.230 [22] to model the parton shower, hadronisation, and underlying event, with parameters set according to the A14 tune [23] and using the NNPDF2.3lo set of PDFs. The decays of bottom and charm hadrons were performed by EvtGen 1.6.0 [24]. The impact of using a different parton shower and hadronisation model is evaluated by comparing the top tagger performance with another \(t\bar{t}\) sample produced with the Powheg Box v2 generator interfaced with Herwig 7.13 [25, 26] instead of Pythia 8.230, using the Herwig 7.1 default set of tuned parameters [26, 27] and the MMHT2014LO PDF set [28]. Additionally, to assess the impact on the top-tagging performance due to the matching of NLO matrix elements to the parton shower, a \(t\bar{t}\) MC sample generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO 2.6.0 and interfaced with Pythia 8.230 [22] with parameters set according to the A14 tune is also used.

Footnote 2: The \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) parameter is a resummation damping factor and one of the parameters that controls the matching of Powheg matrix elements to the parton shower and thus effectively regulates the high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) radiation against which the \(t\bar{t}\) system recoils.

In order to ensure that the top and anti-top quarks are well separated, a \(\Delta R_{t\bar{t}}=\sqrt{\Delta\phi_{t\bar{t}}^{2}+\Delta\eta_{t\bar{t}}^{2} }>2.0\) is required at event-selection level in \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) MC samples. This requirement mainly removes events where a high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) gluon is recoiling against the \(t\bar{t}\) system and affects primarily the \(t\bar{t}\) NLO samples.

Multijet events are used to obtain a sample of jets from gluons and light quarks. These events were generated using the leading-order Pythia 8.235 generator with the NNPDF2.3lo PDF set; including a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-ordered parton shower, the Lund string hadronisation model [29, 30], and the A14 tune for the parton shower and the MPI.

The performance of the top taggers to reject background jets is compared for various generators simulating multijet events. Alternative MC samples are generated with Herwig 7.1.3 and Sherpa 2.2.5. Two samples are generated with Herwig7 at NLO to study the impact of the parton shower on the top tagger background rejection using the default angle-ordered parton shower and a dipole shower, respectively. Both Herwig7 samples used the MMHT2014LO PDF set and dedicated tunes from the authors [31]. In addition, the cluster model [32] is used to describe the hadronisation. Two Sherpa samples are generated to study the impact of the hadronisation model on the background rejection of the top tagger. The matrix element for both samples is added for the \(2\to 2\) process at leading order including the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-ordered parton shower based on the Catani-Seymour dipole factorization [33]. The CT14nnLO[34] PDF set is used for the matrix element calculation, while CT10 [35] is used for the modelling of the MPI. One sample uses the SHERPA AHADIC model for hadronisation based on cluster fragmentation model [36]. The other sample uses the Lund string fragmentation model to simulate the hadronisation. More details about the multijet MC samples can be found in Ref. [37].

Multijet events are generated in slices of the leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) to sufficiently populate the kinematic region of interest. Event-by-event weights are applied to correct for this generation methodology and to produce the expected smoothly falling jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution of the multijet background.

## 3 Large-\(R\) jet reconstruction

Large-\(R\) jets are reconstructed using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [38] as implemented in the FastJet package [39], with a radius parameter \(R=1.0\) to capture the decay of hadronically decaying top quarks. In previous top-tagging definitions in early Run 2, large-\(R\) jets were reconstructed using noise-suppressed topological clusters of calorimeter cells which are brought to the hadronic scale using the local hadronic cell reweighting scheme (LCW) [40]. At high transverse momentum, various particles from the decay of massive particles can be reconstructed within one single topocluster which degrades the reconstruction of substructure observables and thus results in a diminished signal-to-background separation. ATLAS developed a new input type, Track-CaloClusters (TCCs) [41], specifically for large-radius jets that takes advantage of the excellent angular resolution of charged particle tracks reconstructed in the inner detector and combines it with the energy measurement in the calorimeter to resolve the inner structure of large-\(R\) jets in dense environments. It was found however that jets reconstructed from TCCs have a degraded jet mass resolution compared to jets reconstructed from topogial clusters for top-jets (\(W\)-jets) with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\lesssim 1500\) (800) GeV. Tracks, in combination with calorimeter measurements, are also widely used in the reconstruction of small-\(R\) jets (\(R=0.4\)) to suppress contaminations from pile-up and to improve the angular resolution using a particle-flow (PFlow) algorithm [42; 43]. Jets reconstructed from PFlow objects or TCCs perform well in distinct kinematic regions, motivating a new input type, called "Unified Flow Objects" that unifies PFlow objects and TCCs to achieve optimal performance over a broad kinematic range.

A detailed optimisation was performed in Ref. [7] to find an optimal combination of the jet input type, constituent-level pile-up mitigation technique and grooming algorithm in terms of robustness against pile-up, jet energy and mass resolution as well as the performance to identify boosted hadronic decays. The new jet definition that was found to significantly outperform previously used jet definitions in ATLAS is: anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets reconstructed from UFOs, pre-processed with constituent-subtraction (CS) [44; 45] and SoftKiller (SK) [46]. In addition, the soft-drop (SD) grooming algorithm [47; 48] with parameters \(\beta\) = 1.0 and \(z_{\mathrm{cut}}\) = 0.1 is used to remove undesireable soft and wide-angle radiation as well as energy deposits from pile-up and the underlying event from jets. The new jet collection is referred to as UFO SD jets in the following.

The performance of the top tagger using this new jet collection is compared to the previous tagger based on the default jet collection in ATLAS: anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets reconstructed from locally-calibrated topological clusters and groomed with the trimming algorithm [49] with parameters \(R_{\mathrm{cut}}=0.2\) and \(f_{\mathrm{cut}}=0.05\). This jet collection is referred to as LCTopo jets in the following. To improve the jet mass resolution at high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), LCTopo jets use the combined mass, \(m^{\mathrm{comb}}\), which is calculated as the weighted sum of masses from calorimeter information and from mixed calorimeter and tracking information.

In addition to the detector-level jets described above, large-\(R\) jets are also constructed from simulated stable particles to define particle-level ("truth") jets. The stable particles are required to have a lifetime greater than 10 ps and muons and neutrinos are excluded as they only leave minimal energy within the calorimeter. For each detector-level jet collection, a corresponding groomed truth jet collection is defined using the same grooming algorithm and parameters as for the detector-level jets.

The jet energy and mass of detector-level jets are calibrated to particle-level using MC simulations [50].

## 4 Top truth labelling strategy

A labelling strategy based on the corresponding particle-level large-\(R\) jet properties is defined to distinguish between signal and background large-\(R\) jets at detector level. This is important in the optimisation of the top taggers, evaluation of the performance, as well as in the derivation and application of the tagger efficiency scale factors. Truth-level information is used to define a labelling strategy which allows to select large-\(R\) jets originated from the hadronic decays of a top quark. Two different top truth labelling strategies are designed depending on the topology of the top-quark decay products. The contained-top label is designed for large-\(R\) jets that contain all of the energy from the hadronically decaying top quark, whereas the inclusive top label is designed for any jet that contains parts of the hadronic top quark decay regardless of full containment.

The labelling procedure is done in different steps. Firstly, the detector-level large-\(R\) jet (\(J\)) is geometrically matched to the corresponding particle-level jet (\(J_{\text{truth}}\)) by requiring \(\Delta R(J,J_{\text{truth}})<0.75\). Secondly, \(J_{\text{truth}}\) is matched to a top quark after the final-state radiation by requiring \(\Delta R(J_{\text{truth}},\text{top})<0.75\). Large-\(R\) jets fulfilling these two requirements are labelled as inclusive tops.

In Ref. [8], jets were labelled as contained tops if the decay products of the top quark, i.e \(t\to Wb\to qq^{\prime}b\) are matched to \(J_{\text{truth}}\) within \(\Delta R<0.75\). This labelling strategy is referred to in the following as _parton-based_ truth labelling strategy. The distribution of the partons within the truth jets varies significantly across generators and a new truth labelling strategy was defined in Ref. [9] using solely information at particle-level. In Ref. [9], a jet is defined as contained-top if at least one \(b\)-hadron is ghost-associated [51] to the truth jet and if the groomed truth jet mass is \(m>140\) GeV (referred to as _groomed_ truth labelling strategy). The _groomed_ truth labelling strategy was specifically optimised for trimmed jets and resulted in a lower efficiency compared to the _parton-based_ truth label. A new generic truth labelling strategy is defined in this note that uses moments of the ungroomed truth jet that do not vary significantly between different MC generators (referred to as _ungroomed_ truth labelling strategy). A jet is assumed to contain the full decay products of the top quark decay if at least one \(b\)-hadron is ghost-associated to the ungroomed truth jet \(J_{\text{truth}}\), its mass is above 140 GeV and fulfills a \(p_{\text{T}}\)-dependent criteria on the \(k_{t}\) splitting scale (\(\sqrt{d_{32}}\)) [52, 53].

In order to find the optimal cut on \(\sqrt{d_{32}}\), the distribution is divided into different parton-level categories depending on which of the partons from the top decay (\(qq^{\prime}b\)) are matched to \(J_{\text{truth}}\). Four different categories are defined, namely \(qqb\), \(qq\), \(qb\) and \(q\), by matching the \(qq^{\prime}b\), \(qq^{\prime}\), \(qb\) or \(q^{\prime}b\) and \(q\) or \(q^{\prime}\) partons, respectively to \(J_{\text{truth}}\) with \(\Delta R(J_{\text{truth}},q/q^{\prime}/b)<0.75\). The requirement on \(\sqrt{d_{32}}\) is chosen to keep a compromise between enhancing the relative contribution of the \(qqb\) category without significantly removing signal jets.

Figure 1 shows the \(\sqrt{d_{32}}\) distribution for different parton-level categories in two different \(p_{\text{T}}\) bins. Jets belonging to the \(qq^{\prime}b\) category have larger values of \(\sqrt{d_{32}}\) since three prompt objects are expected within the truth jet. Due to the boost of the top, the relative contribution from the \(qqb\) category increases with \(p_{\text{T}}\)

Therefore, the requirement on \(\sqrt{d_{32}}\) can be loosened to keep high efficiencies as \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) increases. The optimal cut on \(\sqrt{d_{32}}\) was found to decrease exponentially with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), having values of \(\approx 21\) GeV at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=350\) GeV and \(\approx 7\) GeV at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=1500\) GeV.

Figure 2(a) shows the fraction of jets that is labelled as contained as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for the _parton-based_, _groomed_ and _ungroomed_ truth labelling strategies (efficiency of the truth label). It can be seen that the _ungroomed_ truth label defines more jets that are matched to a top quark as contained than the _parton-based_ or _groomed_ truth label. In order to understand how many of the jets that are labelled as contained by each of the criteria overlap with the parton-level interpretation of a contained top quark, the jets are in addition matched to the \(qq^{\prime}b\) partons from the top quark decay by requiring \(\Delta R<0.75\) with respect to the jet axis. The fraction of contained top-jets that are matched to the \(qq^{\prime}b\) partons is shown in Figure 2(b) and referred to as parton-level purity. For the _parton-based_ truth label, the purity is per definition one. The fraction of jets labelled as contained top-jet and matched to the \(qq^{\prime}b\) partons with respect to the total number of top-matched jets is shown in Figure 2(c). The new _ungroomed_ truth label selects a significantly higher fraction of \(qq^{\prime}b\)-matched jets than the _groomed_ truth label especially for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>750\) GeV while the _groomed_ and _ungroomed_ labels perform similarly for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<600\) GeV. The _ungroomed_ truth label selects approximately the same number of \(qq^{\prime}b\)-matched jets as the previous _parton-based_ label, but overall it classifies more jets as contained tops.

As previously mentioned, the angular distribution of the partons within the truth jet can vary between different MC generators. This is shown in Fig. 3(a) which depicts the fraction of jets labelled as contained using the _parton-based_ label as a function of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for SM \(t\bar{t}\) events generated with Powheg+Pythia8, Powheg+Herwig7 and MadGraph+aMC@NLO as well as the \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) sample generated with Pythia8. Variations of about 5% can be observed between the Powheg+Pythia8\(t\bar{t}\) sample and the exotic \(Z^{\prime}\) sample which is flat as a function of the ungroomed truth jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The smallest variations from Powheg+Pythia8 are observed for MadGraph+aMC@NLO while Powheg+Herwig7 differs from Powheg+Pythia8 by approximately 4% and the discrepancy decreases as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). For \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\gtrsim 700\) GeV, good agreement is found between the three SM \(t\bar{t}\) samples. In addition, the fraction of jets labelled as contained is shown for the new _ungroomed_ truth label in Fig. 3(b). The fraction of contained top jets agrees within roughly 1-2% over most of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range for the three SM \(t\bar{t}\) samples. For jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>700\) GeV, the efficiency of

The distributions are normalised to the total number of top-matched jets in the given \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range.

the SM \(t\bar{t}\) samples agrees also within 1% with the \(Z^{\prime}\) sample, however larger variations of up to \(\approx 5\%\) are observed at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The comparison of the ungroomed truth jet mass and \(\sqrt{d_{32}}\) distributions between different generators is shown in Appendix A for two different \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bins.

## 5 Top tagger definition and performance

Two taggers based on deep neural-network (DNN) using hadronic jet properties as inputs, including various jet substructure variables, are optimised to identify jets produced by the hadronic decay of a top quark. One of the networks was trained to identify jets labelled as inclusive tops and the other to identify jets that are labelled as contained tops. The configuration of the DNNs used in this note is similar to the one

Figure 2: The following distributions are shown for each of the three different labelling strategies: (a) the fraction of top-matched jets that are labelled as contained (label efficiency), (b) the parton-level purity of the truth label defined as the fraction of \(qq^{\prime}b\)-matched jets with respect to the number of jets labelled as contained and (c) the fraction of top-matched jets that are labelled as contained and matched to the \(qq^{\prime}b\) partons from the top. The distributions in (c) can be obtained by multiplying the values of the efficiency distributions in (a) with those from the parton-level purity in (b). The distributions are shown for jets in the \(Z^{\prime}\) sample. The black distribution in (b) is one per definition and thus the black distributions in (a) and (c) are the same.

described in detail in Ref. [54]. The \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) and Pythia8 multijet MC samples described in Section 2 are used as a source of signal and background jets, respectively. To ensure that all jet substructure features are well-defined for the DNN training, two additional selection criteria are applied to the groomed reconstructed jet mass (\(m>40\) GeV) and the number of constituents (\(N^{\text{const}}\geq 3\)). The truth \(p_{\text{T}}\) spectra for both signal and background jets are enforced to be uniform in the training of the tagger to prevent the algorithm from discriminating using differences in the \(p_{\text{T}}\) distribution.

The selection of jet substructure moments, used as input to the DNN training was re-optimised for the new UFO SD jet collection to enhance the discrimination between top-jets and quark-/gluon-initiated jets. The following 15 variables were found to be optimal as input to the DNN for the identification of inclusive and contained top-jets: \(N\)-subjettiness [55; 56], \(\tau_{1}\), \(\tau_{2}\), \(\tau_{3}\) and \(\tau_{4}\); \(k_{t}\) splitting scales [52], \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\) and \(\sqrt{d_{23}}\); (generalized) energy correlation functions and their ratios [57; 58], \(\text{ECF}_{1}\), \(\text{ECF}_{2}\), \(\text{ECF}_{3}\), \(C_{2}\), \(D_{2}\), \(L_{2}\) and \(L_{3}\); \(Q_{\text{W}}\)[52] as well as thrust major \(T_{\text{M}}\)[59]. \(L_{2}\) and \(L_{3}\) are defined as

\[L_{2}=\frac{{}_{3}e_{3}^{\beta=1}}{({}_{1}e_{2}^{\beta=2})^{3/2} }\,,\] \[L_{3}=\frac{{}_{1}e_{3}^{\beta=1}}{({}_{3}e_{3}^{\beta=1})^{1/3} }\,,\]

where \({}_{1}e_{3}^{\beta=1}\), \({}_{1}e_{2}^{\beta=2}\) and \({}_{3}e_{3}^{\beta=1}\) are the generalized energy correlation functions [60]. These variables were included in the list of variables to separate jets containing a 3-prong structure from jets with a 2-prong structure.

Selection criteria are applied on the DNN output score to define two working points (WPs) with a fixed signal efficiency of 80% and 50% as a function of the \(p_{\text{T}}\) for the inclusive and contained top tagger. In the following, only reconstructed jets with \(p_{\text{T}}>350\) GeV, \(m>40\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.0\) are used to study the performance of the top taggers.

Figure 3: The fraction of jets labelled as contained top-jet with respect to the total number of top-matched jets obtained for different MC generators is shown for (a) the _parton-based_ label and (b) the _ungroomed_. The ratio with respect to Powheg+Pythia8 (P+P8), the nominal MC sample used in the derivation of signal efficiency tagging scale factors is shown in the lower panel.

### Tagger performance for UFO SD jets

The background rejection, defined as the inverse of the background efficiency, as a function of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is depicted in Figure 4 for the 50% and 80% signal efficiency working points for the contained and inclusive top taggers. For the contained top tagger, the _ungroomed_ truth label is used. At high transverse momentum, the background rejection of the inclusive and contained taggers are approximately the same as most jets selected by the inclusive tagger contain the full decay of the top quark. For the 80% signal efficiency working point, the background rejection is relatively stable as a function of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) while the background rejection for the 50% working points varies significantly with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for both inclusive and contained definitions.

### Comparison between UFO SD and LCTopo jets

The background rejection is evaluated as a function of the signal efficiency for the contained and inclusive top taggers for two different \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bins and shown in Figures 5. The performance of the DNN tagger developed for UFO SD jets is compared to the performance of the top taggers described in Ref. [9]. The contained top taggers documented in Ref. [9] were optimised with the _groomed_ truth label. In order to allow for a fair comparison between both taggers and to study the same signal jets, Fig. 5 shows the performance of the contained top tagger using the same truth labelling strategy (_parton-based_ labelling) for both jet collections. The taggers developed for the new UFO SD jet collection outperform the taggers defined for LCTopo jets in the whole \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range thanks to the improved reconstruction of the substructure variables used in the DNN tagger for UFO SD jets. In addition, the performance is also improved for the inclusive top tagger using UFO SD jets.

The background rejection as a function of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is depicted in Figure 6 for the four defined WPs. For the inclusive top tagger, the background rejection is improved in general in the studied \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range. For jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\approx 1.5\) TeV, the background rejection of UFO SD jets is better compared to LCTopo jets by a factor

Figure 4: Comparison of the background rejection of UFO SD jets as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) in Pythia8 multijet events for a fixed signal efficiency of 50% and 80% for the inclusive and contained top tagger. For the contained top tagger, the _ungroomed_ truth label is used.

of approximately 1.8 for the 50% signal efficiency WP. The background rejection for the contained top tagger is compared when the tagger is applied to the same signal jets that are labelled as contained top-jets using the _parton-based_ truth labelling strategy. The DNNs for UFO SD jets and LCTopo jets are not retrained for this particular truth jet definition but the cut on the DNN score was optimised to achieve a flat signal efficiency as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) when applying it to top-matched jets labelled as contained using the _parton-based_ truth labelling strategy. The contained UFO SD tagger outperforms the LCTopo tagger for both working points. The background rejection for the contained top tagger at 50% signal efficiency improves by a factor of two for UFO SD jets compared to LCTopo jets.

Figure 5: Background rejection vs. signal efficiency for the contained (top) and inclusive (bottom) top tagger for UFO and LCTopo jets with 350 GeV \(<p_{\mathrm{T}}<\) 500 GeV (left) and 1500 GeV \(<p_{\mathrm{T}}<\) 2000 GeV (right). In (a) and (b), the same truth labelling strategy (_parton-based_ labelling) is used for the contained top tagger for the LCTopo and UFO jet collections. Top-jets are extracted from the \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) sample, while background events are simulated with Pythia8.

## 6 MC modelling dependence of UFO top taggers

Modelling uncertainties are one of the dominating uncertainties in the estimation of signal and background efficiency scale factors derived from \(t\bar{t}\) events in the lepton+jet channel and \(\gamma\)+jet and dijet events, respectively [9]. Therefore, the dependence of the signal efficiency and background rejection is studied for various MC generators. As described in Section 2, four MC samples are studied for signal top-jets: NLO \(t\bar{t}\) production using Powheg+Pythia8, Powheg+Herwig7 and MadGraph+aMC@NLO as well as a LO Pythia8\(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) signal sample. For the background rejection, five different MC samples are considered for the simulation of multijet events: Pythia8, Sherpa, Sherpa with the Lund string fragmentation model (referred to as Sherpa Lund) as well as Herwig7 with angle-ordered (Herwig angular) and dipole parton shower (Herwig dipole). The nominal samples used in the signal and background scale factor extraction are Powheg+Pythia8 and Pythia8, respectively.

The background rejection as a function of the signal efficiency is shown in Figure 7 for the inclusive and contained UFO top taggers. Only the MC generator used to simulate signal jets is varied and the Pythia8 multijet sample is used for all four distributions. A lower high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bin is chosen here compared to the previous figures due to limited available statistics of top jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\gg 1000\) GeV in the SM \(t\bar{t}\) samples. The largest differences are observed between Powheg+Pythia8 and Powheg+Herwig7 with variations of up to 40% for very low signal efficiencies. The discrepancies are reduced for higher signal efficiencies. At low and high transverse momentum, the background rejection for fixed signal efficiencies differs up to 10% between the Pythia8\(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) sample and the Powheg+Pythia8 sample for both the inclusive and contained top tagger, except for the contained top tagger at high signal efficiencies where discrepancies of up to 20% are observed.

The signal efficiency as a function of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is shown for the four different signal MC samples in Figure 8. The signal efficiency in the Powheg+Pythia8 sample decreases slightly with higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for both working points and tagger definitions but is more pronounced for the 80% signal efficiency working point. The efficiency in the Pythia8\(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) signal sample, used to define the WPs, is roughly flat around the design

value of the WP. The variations in signal efficiency between the different MC samples are larger for the 50% WP compared to the 80% WP and decrease with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The signal efficiency in the Powheg+Pythia8 sample is in general higher than the efficiency of the Pythia8 \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) sample (variations of up to 5%), while the efficiency in the Powheg+Herwig7 is always significantly lower (variations of more than 10% at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)). This shows the dependence of the studied top taggers on the parton shower model which is included in the simulation of the signal MC samples. In order to reduce the uncertainty on the tagger performance due to the parton shower modelling, dedicated calibrations could be derived by comparing top-tagging efficiencies between data and different MC models.

The background rejection is shown as a function of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) in Figure 9 for five different background MC samples. The background rejection in Pythia8 and Herwig7 with an angle-ordered parton shower agree best across the whole \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range with differences of up to 5%. At high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}>2\) TeV), the differences between Pythia8 and the two Sherpa multijet samples are significantly reduced and lie within 10% (5%) for the 50% (80%) WPs for both the contained and inclusive tagger. At low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), variations in the background rejection of more than 20% can be observed between Pythia8 and the two Sherpa samples. The effect of the hadronisation model on the background rejection can be studied by comparing the Sherpa samples with the cluster fragmentation model and the Lund fragmentation model. The differences are of the order

of 5% and slightly decreasing as a function of \(p_{\text{T}}\). Overall better agreement is found between the different MC generators for the 80% signal efficiency WP compared to the 50% WP.

## 7 Conclusions

Top tagging algorithms to identify large-\(R\) jets as boosted hadronically decaying top quarks are developed in MC simulation for the new UFO SD jet collection. The top taggers use machine learning techniques based on jet substructure variables as inputs.

The performance of the top taggers is improved especially for the 50% WP compared to previous top taggers developed for jets reconstructed solely from topclusters. For the inclusive top tagger that aims at identifying top jets regardless of their containment within the large-\(R\) jets, the multijet background rejection is improved in general in the studied \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range by almost a factor of two for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) around 1.5. In the case of the contained top tagger, the background rejection increases by 20-35% for \(1.5<p_{\mathrm{T}}<2\) with respect to the previous LCTopo top tagger when a different truth labelling strategy is used for UFO SD and LCTopo jets. When the same _parton-based_ labelling definition is applied for UFO SD and LCTopo jets, the contained top tagger based on UFO SD jets outperforms the LCTopo top taggers in the whole \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range.

The dependence of the signal efficiency and background rejection on the MC generators is also studied. Differences due to the MC modelling are found in general when comparing the performance of the top

taggers between different MC samples. The differences between the studied MC models are larger in general at low \(p_{\rm T}\) and for the 50% efficiency WPs. The largest difference on the signal efficiency is found when comparing the performance of the contained and inclusive top taggers between \(t\bar{t}\) MC samples including different parton shower models, namely Pythia8 and Herwig7. In order to reduce the uncertainty on the tagger performance due to the MC modelling, dedicated calibrations could be derived by comparing top-tagging efficiencies between data and different MC models. Further studies along these lines will be performed in the future.

In addition, a new top truth labelling strategy is defined for contained-top jets. This new strategy allows to select more signal jets achieving higher relative contribution from the \(qq^{\prime}b\) category compared to the previous labelling procedure.
