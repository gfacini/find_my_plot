**Abstract**

This work is devoted to the determination of the electron energy resolutions of two Extended Barrel modules and one Barrel module at energies E = 10, 20, 50, 100 and 180 GeV and \(\theta=20^{o}\) and \(90^{o}\) and \(\eta\) scan on the basis of the July 2002 test beam run data using the fit filter method of the PMT signal reconstruction. We have derived the statistical and constant terms for the electron energy resolution by fitting of the quadratic \(\sigma/E=a_{s}/\sqrt{E}\oplus b_{s}\) and linear \(\sigma/E=a_{l}/\sqrt{E}+b_{l}\) expressions to the obtained data. The parameters of the electron energy resolution for the quadratic fit are equal to \(a_{s}=28.8\pm 0.8\) % \(\sqrt{GeV}\), \(b_{s}=2.8\pm 0.2\) % at \(\theta=20^{o}\) and \(a_{s}=20.5\pm 0.2\) % \(\sqrt{GeV}\), \(b_{s}=2.1\pm 0.1\) % at \(\theta=90^{o}\). For the linear fit the ones are \(a_{l}=25\pm 1\) % \(\sqrt{GeV}\), \(b_{l}=1.5\pm 0.2\) % for \(\theta=20^{o}\) and \(a_{l}=17.5\pm 0.5\) % \(\sqrt{GeV}\), \(b_{l}=1.2\pm 0.1\) % for \(\theta=90^{o}\).

We have compared our results on energy resolution with the Monte Carlo based parametrization. Good agreement is observed for the linear fit. As for the quadratic fit we have been forced to increase the parameter \(\sigma_{0}\) in this parametrization by 25% in order to achieve the agreement with the real data.

Comparison of the corresponding values of the electron energy resolution obtained by two different PMT signal reconstruction method - the flat filter and fit filter ones shows their coincidence within the errors.

Introduction

The ATLAS detector at the LHC will have a huge physics discovery potential, in particular in the detection of a heavy Higgs boson [1, 2]. Calorimeters will play a crucial role in it. It is necessary to have confidence that the calorimeters will perform as expected.

With the aim of establishing of the electromagnetic energy scale and understanding of performance of the ATLAS Tile calorimeter to electrons some modules have been exposed in electron beams with various energies.

This work is devoted to the determination of the electron energy resolutions for 3 modules of the ATLAS iron-scintillator tile hadron calorimeter - JINR-55, IFA-42 and ANL-44 on the basis of the July 2002 test beam period using the fit filter method for the photomultiplier (PMT) signal reconstruction.

The results of the electromagnetic calibration of these modules are given in [3, 4, 5, 6].

Earlier the electron energy resolutions for the modules JINR-34, IFA-15 and IFA-24, exposed in the September 2001 test beam run, were obtained in [7]. The ANL-44, IFA-42 and JINR-55 Modules at energies E = 10, 20, 50, 100 and 180 GeV and \(\theta\) = 20\({}^{o}\) and 90\({}^{o}\) and \(\eta\) scan from the July 2002 testbeam run data using the flat filter method of the PMT signal reconstruction were investigated in [8].

## 2 The ATLAS Hadron Tile Calorimeter

The ATLAS Hadron Tile Calorimeter (TileCal) is a 2900 t sampling calorimeter using iron as passive material and tiles of scintillator as active material, readout out by wavelength shifting fibers [9]. This calorimeter will play a very important role to identify jets, measure their energy and direction, reconstruct the transverse missing energy. The goal of the TileCal is to measure hadrons energy with good resolution (\(\sigma/E=50\%\sqrt{GeV}/\sqrt{E}\oplus 3\%\)) and linearity (1-2 % up to the TeV scale).

An innovative feature of this calorimeter is the orientation of the scintillators that are placed in planes perpendicular to the colliding beams (Fig. 1 (left)). This disposition simplifies the tile-fiber and fiber-PMT coupling, reduces the dead spaces of the calorimeter and hence increases hermecity. Due to this feature we can get an hermetic coverage up to \(\mid\eta\mid=1.7\) (\(\mid\eta\mid=5\) with forward calorimeters). This is very important for the reconstruction of the transverse missing energy.

The TileCal is divided into one barrel and two extended barrel sections. All three sections have a cylindrical structure with an inner radius of 2280 mm and outer one of 4230 mm. The barrel section is 5460 mm in length along the beam axis, while each extended barrel has a length of about 2910 mm. Each of the cylinders is further subdivided into 64 independent azimuthally oriented modules. Within each module, there are a number of readout cells. Each cell is a set of scintillating tiles connected by fibers to 2 PMTs. The TileCal will contain 4672 cells which will be read-out by 9344 PMTs. Two fibres collect light from every scintillator tile at both of its azimuthal edges. The total number of tiles is 456000.

In this way, the calorimeter is divided in \(\eta\times\phi\) towers, which have a "pseudo-projective" geometry pointing to the nominal interaction point, and radially segmented in three depths. The thicknesses of depths at \(\eta\)=0 are 1.5 \(\lambda\) (\(\lambda\) is the nuclear interaction length) in the first sampling, 4.2 \(\lambda\) in the second one, and 1.9 \(\lambda\) in the third one, with a total depth of 7.6 \(\lambda\). The granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) at \(\eta\)=0 is 0.1\(\times\)0.1 for the first two depths and 0.2\(\times\)0.1 in the third compartment.

The iron structure of each module consists of a number of repeated periods (Fig. 1 (right)). Each period is 18 mm thick and consists of four layers. The first and third layers are formed by large trapezoidal steel plates (master plates), and spanning the full longitudinal dimension of the module. In the second and fourth layers, smaller trapezoidal steel plates (spacer plates) and scintillator tiles alternate. These layers consist of 11 different trapezoids of steel and scintillator, each spanning from 97 to 187 mm. The master plates, spacer plates and scintillator tiles are of 5 mm, 4 mm and 3 mm thick, respectively. The iron to scintillator ratio is 4.67:1.

## 3 Test beam setup

The calibration program with electrons, pions and muons was performed in the H8 beam at the CERN SPS. The test beam setup used for the calibration is shown in Fig. 2.

The Barrel Module 0 is the bottom module mounted on the table. The middle layer is the production barrel module BM\(\pm\) (JINR-55). The top layer consists of two extended barrel modules: EBM\(+\) (IFA-42) for \(\eta>0\) and EBM\(-\) (ANL-44) for \(\eta<0\).

Figure 1: Principle of the TileCal (left). Exploded view of an assembled TileCal period (right).

Figure 2: Sketch of the July 2002 test beam setup. Barrel module JINR-55 is the middle layer. Extended Barrel modules IFA-42 \(\eta>0\) and ANL-44 \(\eta<0\) are the top layer.

Upstream of the TileCal modules the trigger counter telescope, two wire beam chambers and the helium Cherenkov threshold counter have been installed. These chambers allowed to reconstruct the impact points of beam particles on the calorimeter face to better than \(\pm\) 1 mm. The Cherenkov counter gave the possibility to tag \(\pi\)-mesons and electrons.

The layout of the readout cell geometry for modules is shown in Fig. 3. Each module is read out in three longitudinal layers. The first layer

Figure 3: The layout of the cell geometry.

consists of A-cells, the second one -- of B- and C-cells, and the third one -- of D-cells. There are 11 transverse rows of tiles (tilerows) in a module. For a barrel module A-cells have the 1 - 3 tilerows, B- and C-cells have the 4 -7 tilerows, D-cells have the 10 - 11 tilerows. For a extended barrel module A-cells have the 1 - 3 tilerows, B- and C-cells have the 4 - 6 tilerows, D-cells have the 7 - 11 ones.

### Data

We have used the July 2002 exposition of the setup by the electron beams with energies of 10, 20, 50, 100, 180 GeV at \(\theta=\pm 20^{o}\), \(\theta=90^{o}\), \(\eta=0.05to1.45\), where \(\theta\) is the angle between the perpendicular to the front face of central module and the beam direction, \(\eta\) is a pseudorapidity, \(\eta=-\ln\tan((90^{o}-\theta)/2)\). The volume of the analyzed information is the following: 390 Ntuples, 200 Gbytes, 15 million events.

### PMT signal reconstruction method

For the PMT signal reconstruction we have used the fit filter method [14, 15]. This method is based on fitting the pulse shape function, f(t), to samples \(s_{i}\) (a PMT signal is sampled 9 times with a 25 ns interval) of event

\[f(t)=R_{fit}\cdot g(t-\tau)+ped, \tag{1}\]

where \(g(t-\tau)\) is the known normalized pulse shape function, \(t\) is time, \(\tau\) is the phase (peak position in time), "\(ped\)" is a pedestal. So, the reconstructed response, \(R_{fit}\), is the amplitude of the PMT signal.

### Electron selection

The H8 electron beams at the SPS CERN are a mixture of electrons, muons and hadrons. Therefore, we have performed the identification of (\(e\), \(\mu\), \(\pi\)) particles on the basis of the calorimetric information. We have used the following three selection criteria [16].

#### 3.3.1 Electron selection using longitudinal shower energy deposition

The first selection variable (cut 1)

\[C_{i}=\sum_{selected\ i}\ \sum_{k=1}^{2}\sum_{l=1}^{2}E_{ikl}/E_{beam}, \tag{2}\]

is a value of the relative shower energy deposition in the first two calorimeter depths, where \(E_{ikl}\) is the energy response of an \(PMT_{ikl}\), \([E_{ikl}]=pC\), \(k\) is the depth number, \(i\) is the cell number in the \(k\)-depth, \(l=1,\ 2\) is the PMT number in the \(ik\) cell, \([C_{i}]=pC/GeV\).

Fig. 4 (top-left) shows the typical \(C_{i}\) distributions. The left peak corresponds to the pion events, the right peak corresponds to the electron events.

#### 3.3.2 Electron selection using lateral shower energy deposition

The second selection variable (cut 2) is suggested in [18] and related with the lateral shower spread

\[E_{cut}=\frac{\sqrt{\sum_{ik}(E_{ik}^{\alpha}-\sum_{ik}E_{ik}^{\alpha}/N_{ik})^ {2}}}{\sum_{ik}E_{ik}^{\alpha}}\, \tag{3}\]

where \(N_{ik}\) is the used cells number, \(\alpha=0.6\). For example, for a 100 GeV pion shower the 99% containment radius is equal to 430 mm, but for an electromagnetic shower it is equal to 70 mm.

Fig. 4 (top-right) shows the typical \(E_{cut}\) distributions. The left peak corresponds to the pion events, the right peak corresponds to the electron events.

Fig. 4 (middle) shows the scatter plot of \(E_{cut}\) versus \(C_{i}\). The top right region are the electron events, the bottom left region are the pion events. These Figures allow to determine the values of the cuts and to estimate the contaminations.

We have estimated by extrapolation of the fitted pion peak curve to the region of the electron peak (Figs. 4) that the contamination of the pion events in the electron events does not exceed the 0.2% level [16].

The scatter plot \(E_{cut}\) versus \(C_{i}\) (middle). The scatter plots of \(E_{cut}\) vs \(\tilde{\rm C}_{1}\) and \(C_{i}\) vs \(\tilde{\rm C}_{1}\) (bottom).

#### 3.3.3 Rejection of muons

For the muon rejection at energies \(E_{beam}\geq 10GeV\) we have used the cut in the total deposited energy: \(E_{tot}>E_{min}\) with \(E_{min}=5\) GeV [19]. This cut efficiently rejects muons as muons loose a very small fraction of their energy in the calorimeter.

#### 3.3.4 Electrons selection using Cherenkov counter

At energies \(\leq 20\) GeV there is a bad selection of electrons by the \(C_{i}\) and \(E_{cut}\) criteria. Because of widening of peaks a big contamination (\(>10\%\)) of pions appears. This situation is greatly improved by using the first Cherenkov counter signal (cut 3). Fig. 4 (bottom)shows the typical scatter plots of \(E_{cut}\) versus C\({}_{1}\) and \(C_{i}\) versus C\({}_{1}\). As it can be seen, electrons (right) are well selected.

#### 3.3.5 Resultant cuts

We have used the following three cuts for the electron selection [16]: the cut 1 is \(C_{i}>\) 0.9 - 1.1, the cut 2 is \(E_{cut}>\) 0.07 - 0.14, the cut 3 is C\({}_{1}>\) 200 - 400. Thanks to these cuts we obtained the clean sample of the electron events (purity is more 99%) for the calibration of modules of the TileCal.

## 4 Electron Energy Resolution

The usual practice of the determination of the resolution is to fit an energy distribution by Gaussian. But this is not our case at angles different from 90\({}^{o}\) because of the longitudinal displacement of tiles which leads to a sine-modulated response [9].

Therefore, we extracted the mean relative electron energy resolutions, \(\sigma/E\), from the distributions of \(RMS/E\) as a function of the impact point \(Z\) coordinate for each A-cell at various energies (Fig. 5). It turned out that such relative \(RMS/E\) values almost independent from the impact point \(Z\) coordinate.

Figs. 6-9 show the \(\sigma/E\) values for the A-cells of \(EBM-\), \(EBM+\), \(BM-\), \(BM+\) at \(\theta=20^{o}\) as a function of A-cell number. Tables 1 - 4 give the corresponding numerical values.

We have fitted these distributions by a straight line for determining of the weighted average and RMS values. If \(\chi^{2}/(N-1)\) of the fit was greater than 1 (N is the number of experimental points) we increased the error obtained from the fit by a scale factor S defined as \(S=[\chi^{2}/(N-1)]^{1/2}\) according to the scaling procedure given in Review of Particle Physics [20].

Note that we do not show the values of \(\chi^{2}/n.d.f\) because we do not test goodness of fit, coincidences of electromagnetic energy resolutions for different cells. Contrary, we expected non-uniformity of energy resolutions for ones. This is connected with the RMS non-uniformity of 6% in the light output of scintillating tiles in a cell [21] and the narrowness of electromagnetic showers. According to [20], 90% of their energies is contained inside of a cylinder with the Moliere radius \(R_{M}\). In our case \(R_{M}\) = 20.5 mm [22] and a period of the calorimeter containing one scintillator tile is 18 mm. So, the most of an electromagnetic shower passes only 6 tiles from 48 available in an A-cell. This leads too to the RMS non-uniformity of 3% for the electromagnetic calibration constants [6].

Fig. 10 (top and middle rows) shows the energy dependencies these

values averaged over cells. The lines are the results of the linear fit:

\[\sigma/E=a_{l}/\sqrt{E}+b_{l}. \tag{4}\]

The obtained statistical \(a_{l}\) and constant \(b_{l}\) terms are shown in Fig. 10 (bottom row) as a function of Module. Fig. 11 shows the results of the quadratic fit:

\[\sigma/E=a_{s}/\sqrt{E}\oplus b_{s}. \tag{5}\]

Figs. 12 - 14 and Tables 5 - 8 show the \(\sigma/E\) values for \(EBM\) and \(BM\) modules as a function of \(\eta\). Figs. 15 - 24 show the energy dependencies these values and the results of the linear or quadratic fits.

Figs. 25 - 28 and Tables 9 - 12 show the \(\sigma/E\) values for \(EBM\) and \(BM\) modules for \(\theta=90^{o}\) as a function of a tilrow number. Figs. 29 - 30 show the energy dependencies the averaged \(\sigma/E\) values and the results of the linear or quadratic fits.

Table 13 gives summary of the average values (%) of the parameters \(a\) and \(b\) for \(\theta=20^{o}\) and \(90^{o}\). The electron energy resolution for \(\theta=90^{o}\) are of 30% smaller the ones for \(\theta=20^{o}\).

We have compared our results for the statistical term in the energy resolution with the parametrization suggested in [23]:

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{a_{MC}}{\sqrt{E}}=\frac{\sigma_{0}}{\sqrt{E}}\left( \frac{t}{X_{Fe}}\right)^{\gamma}\left(\frac{s}{X_{S}}\right)^{-\delta}, \tag{6}\]

where in our case \(\sigma_{0}=6.33\)\(\%\sqrt{GeV}\), \(\gamma=0.62\), \(\delta=0.21\) are the parameters, \(X_{Fe}\), and \(X_{S}\) are the radiation lengths of iron and scintillator, \(t\) and \(s\) are the thicknesses of iron and scintillator. The parameters have been determined in [23] by fitting the Monte Carlo EGS4 data. The accuracy of this formula is 10%.

According to (6), the electron energy resolution is directly proportional to the iron thickness and inversely proportional to the scintillator thickness. Because of the triple difference in the values of power the absorber thickness plays a dominant role in the quantity of the electron energy resolution.

In our case \(t=14\ mm/\sin\theta\) and \(s=3\ mm/\sin\theta\) and this formula can be represented as a function of \(\theta\) angle:

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{C_{\theta}}{\sqrt{E}\cdot(\sin\theta)^{0.41}}, \tag{7}\]where \(C_{\theta}=15.6\)\(\%\sqrt{GeV}\).

Fig. 31 shows the parameters \(a\) and \(b\) of the linear and quadratic fit as a function of \(\theta\). The values of these parameters are the weighted average ones of the corresponding values of \(BM+\) and \(BM-\) (\(EBM+\) and \(EBM-\)) modules. As it can be seen, the parameters \(a\) and \(b\) decrease as \(\theta\) increase. The parameter \(b_{s}\) is about 5% at small angles and decreases to 1 - 2% at 90\({}^{o}\). It may be connected with the unconventional orientation of the scintillating tiles which are along incident particles. The curve in the Fig. 31 (left) is the modified parameterization (7). The curves in Fig. 31 (right) are similar to (7) and given only to guide the eye.

As it can be seen in Fig. 31 and in Table 13, for the linear fit agreement is observed within the errors between the experimental and Monte Carlo results. It is necessary to note that the Monte Carlo calculations in [23] were performed for the iron - scintillator thicknesses of \(t\leq 35\) mm and \(s\leq 10\) mm. It corresponds \(\theta>25^{o}\) in our case. From the results, this parameterization has a larger validity range than expected.

As for the quadratic fit (Fig. 31) we have been forced to increase the parameter \(\sigma_{0}\) in (6) by 25% in order to achieve the agreement with the real data.

Note that for other iron-scintillator calorimeters the underestimation of the real energy resolution is observed. So, Table 14 gives the comparison between the experimental values of the statistical parameter \(a\) for some iron-scintillator calorimeters [24] - [26] and the calculated value \(a_{MC}\) in [23]. As it can be seen, the real values are bigger by 20 - 60 % than the calculated ones.

Comparison of the corresponding values of the electron energy resolution obtained by the flat filter and fit filter methods is shown in Fig. 32. As it can be seen, the coincidence of the corresponding values within the errors is observed although the \(a_{s}\) values of the fit method are slightly systematically smaller than the ones of the flat method.

This is probably connected with smaller noise values in PMT signals for the fit filter method (\(\langle\sigma_{noise}\rangle=20\) MeV) than for the flat filter one (\(\langle\sigma_{noise}\rangle=50\) MeV) [5, 6].

## 5 Conclusions

The electron energy resolutions of the \(EBM-\) (ANL-44), \(EBM+\) (IFA-42) and \(BM\) (JINR-55) Modules of the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter have been investigated. The used experimental data are from the July 2002 testbeam run at energies E = 10, 20, 50, 100 and 180 GeV and \(\theta=20^{o}\) and \(90^{o}\) and \(\eta\) scan. The fit filter method has been applied for the PMT signal reconstruction.

We have determined the statistical and constant terms for the electron energy resolution by fitting of the expressions \(\sigma/E=a/\sqrt{E}\oplus b\) and \(\sigma/E=a/\sqrt{E}+b\) to the obtained data. The average parameters of the electron energy resolution for the quadratic fit are equal to \(a_{s}=28.8\pm 0.8\)\(\%\)\(\sqrt{GeV}\), \(b_{s}=2.8\pm 0.2\)\(\%\) at \(\theta=20^{o}\) and \(a_{s}=20.5\pm 0.2\)\(\%\)\(\sqrt{GeV}\), \(b_{s}=2.1\pm 0.1\)\(\%\) at \(\theta=90^{o}\). For the linear fit the ones are \(a_{l}=25\pm 1\)\(\%\)\(\sqrt{GeV}\), \(b_{l}=1.5\pm 0.2\)\(\%\) for \(\theta=20^{o}\) and \(a_{l}=17.5\pm 0.5\)\(\%\)\(\sqrt{GeV}\), \(b_{l}=1.2\pm 0.1\)\(\%\) for \(\theta=90^{o}\).

We have compared our results for the statistical term in the energy resolution with a Monte Carlo-based parametrization suggested in [23]. Good agreement is observed for the linear fit. As for the quadratic fit we have been forced to increase the parameter \(\sigma_{0}\) in this parametrization by 25\(\%\) in order to achieve the agreement with the real data.

Comparison of the corresponding values of the electron energy resolution obtained by the flat filter and fit filter methods shows their coincidence within the errors although the \(a_{s}\) values of the fit method are slightly systematically smaller the ones of the flat method.
