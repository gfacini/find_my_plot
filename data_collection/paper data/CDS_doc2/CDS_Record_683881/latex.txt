**Abstract**

The workshop addressed the question of shower models/packages and related issues needed for the simulation of ATLAS physics and test beam data. Part of the material discussed during the workshop is reviewed in this note. Results presented on the comparison between ATLAS test beam data and Monte Carlo prediction of various shower models are briefly summarized. The requirements put forward by the various detector communities and first attempts to quantify them are being reviewed.

Introduction

The simulation of showers is one of the basic tools for understanding the response of the ATLAS detector: the shower treatment is of course essential for the Calorimetry, and shower effects are also relevant for the muon and inner detector systems.

The response of calorimeters to jets depends not only on the knowledge of the physics of the production and fragmentation of the jets themselves but also on the response of the calorimeter to electron and hadrons. The calorimeters in ATLAS are non-compensating; the response to hadron is smaller that the one to electron and often non-linear. Those effects have to be corrected to obtain the correct energy scale for jets. Other characteristics of the hadronic showers are also important. The hadronic shower spread is relevant for jet energy calibration and for particle identification. The longitudinal profile affects the fraction of energy deposited in the electromagnetic compartment, the longitudinal energy leakage and energy losses in the dead material distributed along the shower. The lateral profile plays a role for example in the cell signal correlation from minimum-bias events. Both longitudinal and lateral spread affect the signal definition when noise cuts and clustering are applied.

The range of hadron energies relevant for calorimetry is very large at the LHC: from the order of GeV or less for minimum-bias events or low \(p_{T}\) central jets to several hundreds of GeV expected in the fragmentation of jets of few TeV \(p_{T}\). The SPS test beam data can be used for calibration in the energy range from 5 GeV to 400 GeV. For higher and lower energies we will need to rely on extrapolation based on Monte Carlo simulations1. In-situ calibration from measurement of e/p for isolated particles or using physics processes involving known resonances like \(Z^{0}+jet\) or \(W\to jetjet\) decays will be exploited as much as possible but still a reliable Monte Carlo may be needed to extrapolate from these final states to jets from other sources and to other kinematic regimes.

An ATLAS workshop was held at CERN on the 15-16th of September 1997 to address the question of the requirements on the shower models/packages needed for the simulation of ATLAS physics and test beam data. Although in principle the emphasis of the workshop was more on hadronic shower models, it is clear that electromagnetic and hadronic showers are connected. First, a substantial fraction of jet energy goes to \(\pi^{0}\)'s. Second, electromagnetic energy is also intrisically produced in hadronic cascades and therefore an important signal source also for \(\pi^{\pm}\)'s. In addition, electromagnetic showers have to be described with the high precision needed for the EM calorimeter where the excellent resolution that is aimed at requires a good control of the systematic effects. Studying hadronic background to \(\gamma\)/e identification requires high quality description of both hadronic and electromagnetic showers. On the other hand, hadronic showers are also relevant for the other detectors of ATLAS, the inner detector and the muon system mainly because they contribute to the background and it has to be well understood.

In this note, we summarize part of the material that was presented at the workshop that addressed three aspects of the problem.

* Test beam data relevant to the ATLAS calorimetry were compared to available hadronic shower packages.
* The implications for ATLAS physics of the differences observed between data and models and between the models have been studied and the first attempts to quantify them and to formulate the consequent requirements on the performances of the shower models have been presented.
* The models and programs which will be available in the future have been presented. An overview of the GEANT4 project was given and a fairly detailed account of the physics models used in the FLUKA package was presented.

The main purpose of this note is to give a comprehensive overview of what was presented concerning shower model requirements ( Section 3 ). The Section 2 gives a brief selection of the results from the ATLAS test beams in order to allow a first estimate of the performances that can be expected from the shower Monte Carlo based on the shower models available so far in the collaboration.

## 2 Comparison between test beam data and available shower models

Test beam data involving various protypes of the ATLAS calorimeters have been compared to detailed simulation within the GEANT3 package [1]. In the case of hadrons three shower models are available: GEANT-GHEISHA [2], GEANT-FLUKA (the 1992 version of the hadronic interaction routines of FLUKA [3]) and GEANT-CALOR, an implementation of CALOR89 [4] that differs from GEANT-FLUKA only for hadronic interactoins below 10 GeV. The combined LAr EM calorimeter and Tilecal setup has also been simulated with the FLUKA standalone program [5]. In this section, we summarize the main conclusions of the comparison. The aim is not to make a detailed diagnostic of the models but rather to see the level of differences observed between data and the models and between the models themselves. From this we then try to quantify what would be the consequences for ATLAS physics of these levels of uncertainty.

### Test beam results on the response of the various ATLAS calorimeters to hadrons

#### 2.1.1 Comparison between the GEANT3 models and Tilecal standalone test beam data

Data from Tilecal, an Iron-Scintillator sampling calorimeter, have been compared in detail to the shower models available in GEANT3 [7]. Some of the main results are shortly summarized here.

The non-linearity for pions has been measured between 20 and 300 GeV. It is shown in fig. 1. While the data show a non-linearity of the order of 10% in that energy range, GEANT-FLUKA and GEANT-CALOR do not show more that 2 or 3% while GEANT-GHEISHA overestimates this effect. Those differences originate in part from the degree of non-compensation predicted by the models: the values of e/h are 1.19, 1.25 and 1.63 for GEANT-FLUKA, GEANT-CALOR and GEANT-GHEISHA, respectively. GEANT-GHEISHA predicts less visible energy and hence a worse resolution than the other two packages, see table 1. Longitudinal profiles are well described by GEANT-FLUKA and GEANT-CALOR while a discrepancy at the level of 6% in the first sampling is observed in the case of GEANT-GHEISHA. Lateral profiles are not reproduced at the same level,all models predict narrower showers. The differences are up to 30% at 1 \(\lambda\) from the center of the shower. The lateral profile in the Tilecal simulation is also very sensitive to the neutron transport code used.

.1.2 Comparison between Liquid Argon (LAr)hadronic calorimeters test beam data and the GEANT3 models

Data of the RD3 accordion electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter combined with a hadronic LAr/stainless steel calorimeter [8] and the H1 prototype calorimeter of similar composition have been compared to the GEANT3 models [9], [10], [11]. A measurement of

\end{table}

Figure 1: The pion energy response linearity curve for the TileCal standalone tests

\(e/\pi\) in the H1 prototype (see fig. 2) shows that GEANT-GHEISHA underestimates the visible energy while GEANT-CALOR is closer to the data although the predicted non-linearity in the energy range of 20 to 120 GeV is underestimated by about 1.5%. As in the Tilecal case, GEANT-GHEISHA predicts a worse resolution while GEANT-CALOR is about correct. GEANT-FLUKA underestimates the resolution of the RD3 prototype while GEANT-GHEISHA in that case was closer to the data.

Shower profiles have been investigated in the case of the LAr stainless steel calorimeters. The RD3 protype has been compared to GEANT-GHEISHA. The data tend to develop the shower faster although the differences of the average energy in the longitudinal sampling do not exceed 2%. Similar results are obtained with the H1 prototype. Lateral profile compare in both cases less favourably, especially away from the shower axis: at 1 to 2 \(\lambda\) differences of up to a factor 2 can be observed, see fig. 3.

A beam test of the ATLAS LAr hadronic end-cap calorimeter "engineering" prototype module has produced preliminary results [13] on the energy resolution of pions which are compared to the models available in GEANT3 (see fig. 4). GEANT-CALOR describes the data best at high energies while at lower energies the data are more consistent with GEANT-GHEISHA. GEANT-FLUKA predicts a too optimistic resolution over the whole energy range.

#### 2.1.3 Combined LAr and TILECAL data compared to FLUKA standalone and GEANT3

The results of a combined test of the EM LAr and Tilecal calorimeters have been compared to the predictions of FLUKA standalone [12] and GEANT3 [7]. FLUKA reproduces the \(e/\pi\) ratio in the energy range from 20 to 300 GeV pions quite well while GEANT-CALOR shows about 2% less non-linearity (see fig. 5). The longitudinal profile show larger

differences between the two models. GEANT-CALOR predicts about 7% less energy in the EM compartment than the data, while FLUKA reproduces the profile well (see fig. 6).

### Test beam results on the response of ATLAS calorimeters to electrons

Beam data for test modules of the ATLAS EM calorimeter with 'accordion' geometry have been in general satisfactorily described in simulations done with GEANT3. Through the years 1992-1996, various modules with non projective and projective geometry have been tested, mostly with liquid argon as the active medium, but also with liquid krypton. Once the description of the complex accordion geometry has been implemented in GEANT3 with the required level of details, especially for the EM End-Cap modules, the mean energy deposition and resolution were well reproduced. The lateral shower profile and its fluctuations, as measured with the granularity of the modules (3 longitudinal divisions, lateral cells with dimensions from 4.7 mm to 4 cm, overall depth of 24 X0), were found in good agreement with the GEANT3 simulation. The longitudinal shower profile was found in good agreement with the MC in the LKr module, but showed some discrepancy in the barrel LAr module. Energy resolutions of \(10\%/\sqrt{(}E)\) for LAr and \(5.6\%/\sqrt{(}E)\) for LKr, as predicted by GEANT3, have been measured in beam tests (20-300 GeV) with modules using LAr and LKr, respectively. A good agreement between MC and experimental data was observed for the EC LAr module and the LKr module in the modulation of the mean energy response of the calorimeter due to the overlap of the corners of the accordion absorbers/electrodes (see fig. 7). The agreement was not as good for the barrel module.

The description of the early shower development was indirectly verified by testing the effect of the passive material in front of the LKr module. The energy loss was recovered using the'massless gap' technique. When changing the amount of passive material, the

corresponding change in the energy in the massless gap and in the longitudinal compartments of the calorimeter was described within the statistical errors by GEANT3. The precision in measuring the shower position using narrow 4.7 mm wide strips in the test beam was found to be \(2.7mm/\sqrt{(}E)\) in agreement with the GEANT3 prediction. The same is true for the precision on the shower angle (\(33mrad/\sqrt{(}E)\), obtained in test beam) and the separation power between photons from \(\pi^{0}\)'s based on the lateral shower profile.

Some deviations from the MC predictions was observed in the amount of longitudinal energy leakage (10% difference after 24 X0) at a beam energy of 200 GeV. The significance of this difference is not clear because of the uncertainty in the absolute electron energy scale of the hadronic module located behind the EM module.

The LAr and the combined LAr-Tilecal test beam set-up have also been simulated for electrons with FLUKA standalone, with a similar geometry to GEANT3. Pulse shaping is taken into account and electric field maps are computed and used for recombination and drift time. The phi modulation related to the accordion geometry is well reproduced (see fig. 8). The experimental energy resolution and the longitudinal electron shower development are both reproduced within errors.

### Test beam results on the response of the various ATLAS calorimeters to muons

In this section, selected results on radiative energy losses for high energy muons in the ATLAS calorimeters and comparison with the Monte Carlo predictions are briefly discussed.

Figure 9: The truncated mean energy loss and the most probable energy loss for muons in the Tile calorimeter, as a function of the muon energy at a polar angle \(\theta\)= 10\({}^{o}\). The most probable values are obtained from a fit of a Moyal function to the energy loss distribution. The means are obtained ignoring data points 5 times above the fitted sigma.

The RD5 test beam results on hadronic punch-through and radiative muons are summarized in Section 3.3, together with the presentation of the requirements from the muon system. The response of the standalone TILECAL test beam set-up to muons has been simulated with GEANT3, see [14]. Good agreement was obtained in both the deposited energy spectra and in the dependence on energy of the most probable and mean energy loss (see fig. 9). The combined LAr and Tilecal test beam setup was also exposed to a 300 GeV muon beam, where a total of about 700000 events were recorded. An absolute comparison between the experimental energy distributions and the prediction of FLUKA standalone [13] was carried out, showing that the \(e/\mu\) ratio is well reproduced.

The muon signal spectrum for these events is shown in fig. 10. The high statistics allows a more detailed comparison than the one of the previously mentioned study: the spectra are in good agreement except for a small excess of data over MC \((7.0\pm 0.4(stat)\pm 1.6(syst)\%)\) for fractionnal energy loss larger than 0.015x300 GeV.

### Quality of test beam data and simulations

While making detailed comparisons of test beam data with models, it becomes clear that a lot of experimental effects have to be taken into account to reach the desired level of precision of 1% in the diagnostic of the models. The absolute energy calibration, essentially the electromagnetic scale of the different calorimeter compartments, has to be known for \(e/\pi\) measurement. The amount of dead material in the experimental setup in front or in between different calorimeter compartments has to be well known. For example, dead material in front of the calorimeter produces early shower starting points; event rejection based on data cuts have to be well reproduced. Electronic noise gives a non negligible contribution specially on lateral profiles away from the shower center and should again be well reproduced by the Monte Carlo to allow precise comparison. Charge collection efficiencies in LAr calorimeters or quenching effects in scintillators have to be known with enough precision. Beam contamination and composition as well as possible biases in event triggers and filters should be known and taken into account. Test modules may be of limited size and leakage effect may be large. So the requirements on the precision of the shower models also translate onto requirements on the quality of the test beam data.

It was also pointed out that, in order to have a precise comparison between different simulation programs, it is important that they share the same geometry description and that all the relevant features of the setup are described with the necessary precision.

A critical range of energy to understand the response of a calorimeter to hadrons is the regions below 10 GeV down to a few hundred MeV, where the response can be very non-linear and not enough experimental data of the specific ATLAS calorimeters are available to test and possibly improve the shower models.

## 3 First evaluation of the ATLAS requirements on the shower models

A first evaluation of the requirements on the shower models derived from the precision needed for photons, electrons, jets and \(E_{T}^{miss}\) kinematic reconstruction, and for the understanding of the background in the muon system and the inner detector has been carried out.

### Requirements derived from the precision needed in the response to jets and from \(E_{t}^{miss}\)

The differences in the prediction of the three shower models available in GEANT3 and their present level of agreement with data have been taken as an estimate of discrepancies between future ATLAS data and simulations. The consequence of those differences on the jet energy scale and other physics related event variables has been studied.

#### 3.1.1 Jet energy scale in the Barrel calorimeter

The dependence of the jet energy scale on the response of the calorimeter to pions and protons is studied by using ATLFAST [15] interfaced to PYTHIA [16] to generate QCD dijets. ATLFAST provides the possibility of reconstructing jets in different cone size and applying the magnetic field. A simple parameterisation of the pion and proton responses in terms of fundamental calorimeter parameters has been implemented in addition.

The average calorimeter response to hadrons as a function of its energy is governed by the average fraction of energy that is converted into \(\pi^{0}\)'s (\(f_{\pi^{0}}\)) and the intrinsic response of the calorimeter to purely electromagnetic (e) and purely hadronic energy (h): \(\pi=e.f_{\pi^{0}}+h.(1-f_{\pi^{0}})\). This picture is valid for incident energy of

Figure 11: Fraction of electromagnetic energy for \(\pi^{-}\) interacting with iron (the fraction is taken from the sum of the energies of all the \(\pi^{0}\)’s in the course of the shower development).

GeV upwards. Differences in the response to pions and protons araise from the fact that the average fraction of energy converted into \(\pi^{0}\)'s is not the same in the two cases.

The fraction of \(\pi^{0}\)'s can be parameterised as the function of the incident energy of the particle as \(f_{\pi^{0}}=1-(E/E0)^{m-1}\) as proposed by D.Groom [6]. Fig. 11 shows this parameterisation for various values of E0 and m, and in comparison with results on \(f_{\pi^{0}}\) in Fe obtained by the GEANT3 hadronic shower models. The originally fitted \(f_{\pi^{0}}\), determined from CALOR89 Monte Carlo predictions [17], is shown as a dotted line. The experimental e/\(\pi\) ratio measured with the Tilecal standalone prototype was fitted, resulting in a value of e/h of 1.5 and a \(f_{\pi^{0}}\) represented by the dashed line, in good agreement with the CALOR89 prediction. The sets of points in fig. 11 give the results on \(f_{\pi^{0}}\) in Fe obtained by the GEANT3 hadronic shower models. They predict a slower growth. The GEANT-CALOR data fitted with D. Groom's parameterisation is represented by the dash-dotted line.

Fig. 12 shows the response of pions for the fraction of \(\pi^{0}\)'s fitted to CALOR89 and two values of e/h. The response to protons is smaller than the pion response due to the about 10% smaller fraction of \(\pi^{0}\)'s produced by protons [6]. Below the \(\pi^{0}\) production threshold, the response is increasingly dominated by ionization and could be rising again. For simplicity, in the simulation the response was assumed constant.

The non-linearity in the pion response between 20 and 300 GeV changes from 5% to 8% by changing e/h from 1.3 to 1.5, the latter being in agreement with the \(e/\pi\) ratio observed with the combined test beam data shown in fig. 5. If the fraction of \(\pi^{0}\) is taken

Figure 12: Calorimeter response to pion and proton for different values of e/h and parameterisations of \(f_{\pi^{0}}\): the full (dashed) lines show the pion and proton response for \(f_{\pi^{0}}\) taken from CALOR89 and e/h=1.5 (1.3); the dash-dotted line shows the pion response for \(f_{\pi^{0}}\) taken from GEANT-CALOR and e/h=1.3

from the fit to GEANT-CALOR data and for e/h of 1.3 close to the value predicted by GEANT-CALOR, the non-linearity between 20 and 300 GeV reduces to 4%.

The effect of this response of the calorimeter to pion and proton on the non-linearity of the jet response is then evaluated with ATLFAST. QCD dijets are generated with PYTHIA requiring one parton with \(\mid\eta\mid\) less than 0.5. Initial and final state radiation and multiple interactions are switched off. The standard fixed cone jet algorithm of ATLFAST is applied to the particles resulting from the fragmentation. No smearing was applied to the jet energy. The parameterisation of pion and proton response is applied to mesons and baryons respectively. The calorimeter is calibrated at the EM scale: \(\pi^{0}\)'s deposit their full energy.

Fragmentation, cone size and magnetic field have an effect on the jet linearity. Before studying the effect of non-linearity of the particle response, these effects have been quantified. They are illustrated in fig. 13. The effect of the cone size is significant up to about 200 GeV, with an average loss of 15% for a cone of \(\Delta R=0.4\) at 20 GeV.

The effect of particle response is then applied in addition to the effect of the cone and the magnetic field. The effect on the absolute scale for jets is shown in fig. 14 for parton energies up to 200 GeV and in fig. 15 up to 2 TeV. At 200 GeV, the overall shift in energy scale is 10% (14%) for e/h=1.3 (1.5), while at 2 TeV the shift reduces to 6% (8%).

From this simplified ansatz we already see that the non-compensation has to be taken into account in the jet energy calibration. Monte Carlo will not be the only source of information to get the calibration coefficients. Physics process involving known resonances

like \(\gamma+jet\), \(Z^{0}+jet\) or \(W\to jj\) will provide the jet energy scale at least in some range of energies and \(\eta\). Differences in the fragmentation for different type of jets, "QCD" jets or jets from quarks in a color singlet will have to be taken into account while transfering the calibration from one type to another. Dijet \(p_{T}\) balancing will be used to propagate the calibration across \(\eta\) but extrapolation to uncovered kinematic ranges may be necessary.

Figure 15: Reconstructed jet energy for different levels of non-compensation and for two cone sizes for jet energies up to 2 TeV.

Fig. 16 shows the relative difference in the jet energy scale for e/h=1.3 and e/h=1.5: it is of the order of 2 to 3% up to 200 GeV and another 1.5% in the range 200 GeV to 4 TeV. The two cases considered here are, as we have seen, representative of the differences observed between models while test beam data and GEANT-CALOR have for shown even larger differences.

The consequence of an uncorrected jet non-linearity was studied in a concrete physics example, the measurement of the inclusive jet cross-section as a function of the \(p_{T}\) of the jet. It was assumed that the calorimeter could be calibrated up to 500 GeV with in-situ processes and that the Monte Carlo is used to extrapolate the calibration to higher values of \(p_{T}\). Since the jet cross-section versus \(p_{T}\) is rapidly falling, a miscalibration produces an apparent disagreement with the QCD prediction. Fig. 17 shows the ratio of measured cross-section to the QCD prediction in the range 500 Gev to 4 TeV if the degree of non-compensation is overestimated. Ref. [18] shows that such a deviation is of the order of the effect expected for a compositeness scale of 15-20 TeV. The sign of the effect depends if the non-compensation is overestimated or underestimated. This example shows that the level of uncertainty we have observed between the different models and the data is at the level of creating a non-negligible systematic error on some physics process.

#### 3.1.2 Jet energy scale in the End-cap calorimeter

The jet energy scale was studied in the End-cap calorimeter with fully simulated dijet events. Back-to-back dijets of 200, 500 and 2000 GeV at \(\eta=2.45\), the center of the

Figure 16: Relative difference in the calibration for 2 degrees of non-compensation.

ATLAS end-cap calorimeter, have been generated with the three shower models available in GEANT3. The calorimeter is first calibrated at the electromagnetic scale. The additional calibration factor needed to obtain the initial parton energy is different for the three models reflecting the differences in the predicted hadron response. Fig. 18 shows those calibration factors normalized to the GEANT-CALOR case. One sees that GEANT-GHEISHA predicts about 4% less visible energy while GEANT-FLUKA predicts about 5% more. The net result is an overall scale shift between the 3 models. Fig. 18 also shows the relative difference in the predicted non-linearity. While GEANT-GHEISHA and GEANT-CALOR predicts 3% non-linearity between 200 GeV and 2 TeV, GEANT-FLUKA predicts only 2%. Table 2 finally shows the predicted resolution in the three cases.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \(\sigma/E\) & statistical term & constant term \\  & a (\%) & b (\%) \\ \hline

2 GEANT-CALOR & \(55.3\pm 7.0\) & \(3.6\pm 0.3\) \\ \hline
3 GEANT-FLUKA & \(33.8\pm 7.7\) & \(3.0\pm 0.2\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 3.1.3 Jets in the Forward calorimeter

In the case of the Forward calorimeter, high \(p_{T}\) ( \(>100GeV\)) QCD jets have been fully simulated with GEANT-CALOR and GEANT-GHEISHA. The total electromagnetic and hadronic energies deposited in the calorimeter as well as the sampled energies are recorded. The reconstructed jet energy is obtained by summing the visible energies in the EM (Cu/LAr) and the two HAD compartments (W/LAr): \(E_{rec}=\sum c_{i}*E_{vis,i}\). The coefficients \(c_{i}\) are taken directly from the relation \(c_{i}=\langle E_{dep,i}/E_{vis,i}\rangle\) for the jet sample simulated with GEANT-CALOR. This corrects for the effect of limited acceptance.

Fig. 19 shows the reconstructed energy with the above formulae as a function of the pseudo-rapidity of the jet. The intrinsic calorimeter response is rather uniform. GEANT-GHEISHA predicts about 4% less visible energy in the calorimeter than GEANT-CALOR.

Figure 18: Relative normalization factor needed to calibrate the jet energy in case the total energy deposited by the jets in the calorimeter is integrated (no cone) and the calorimeters are calibrated at the electro-magnetic scale. The factors for GEANT-GHEISHA and GEANT-FLUKA are normalized to the factors for GEANT-CALOR: they are 1.175,1.16 and 1.13 at 200, 500 and 2000 GeV respectively (top figure). The difference in non-linearity for the 3 models is given in the bottom figure.

To see what would be the effect of a change in the hadronic efficiency h, the visible hadronic energy has been changed by \(\pm 10\%\) and \(\pm 20\%\). As shown in fig. 19, it changes the jet energy scale by \(\pm 2.5\%\) and \(\pm 5\%\), respectively. As seen in the previous sections, the change of hadronic efficiency is damped in the case of jets due to their high component of EM energy.

The longitudinal profile for jets has also been studied: the total visible energy predicted by GEANT-CALOR in the EM compartment is 5% higher than predicted by GEANT-GHEISHA, about equal in the first HAD compartment and 5% lower in the second. It is a consequence of the differences in the predicted fraction of total EM energy deposited in the three longitudinal compartments (see table 3) and in the sampling fractions for the EM and HAD compartments (see table 4).

#### 3.1.4 Requirements from the hadronic calorimetry

First attempts to quantify the consequences of the differences observed between data and models have been reported in the three preceeding sections. So far, they concern mainly the effect that an incorrectly modelled hadron response has on the resulting jet energy scale for jet energies typical of the three sections of ATLAS calorimetry: barrel, end-cap and forward calorimeters.

Figure 19: FCAL signal linearity for QCD jets with \(P_{T}>100GeV\). The reconstructed energy with limited acceptance unfolded (see text) is shown as a function of the \(\eta\) of the jet. The calibration is done for GEANT-CALOR. The jet energy simulated by GEANT-GHEISHA applying the coefficients from GEANT-CALOR is shown: the energy scale is about 4% smaller. The effect on the jet energy scale of changing the hadronic sampling fraction by \(\pm 10\%\) and \(\pm 20\%\) is also represented.

The differences in the hadron response as predicted by the different MC get translated to the jet response in a somewhat attenuated fashion, since only the energy carried by charged hadrons is involved. One can distinguish two aspects: an overall shift in the energy scale and residual non-linearities. Although the overall shift could be calibrated in-situ calibration with known physics processes, residual differences in non-linearity of the order of a few percents will affect the extrapolation of the energy scale from one kinematic region to another. The only concrete example which has been studied in some details so far is the measurement of the high \(p_{T}\) cross-section. In this case, the uncertainty on the energy scale, if at the level observed between the hadronic models, would give a non-negligible contribution to the systematic error and limit the sensitivity to the compositeness scale accessible at the LHC.

The hadronic models differ also on their predictions for longitudinal and lateral profiles, energy resolution and signal fluctuations in individual cells.

The longitudinal profile affects the predicted level of longitudinal leakage and the amount of energy lost in the dead material. Both will affect the tails expected in the energy spectrum. In the "crack region", where the amount of dead material close to the peak of the shower can be quite large, an incorrect longitudinal profile will result in an incorrect level of tails for jets. That will in turn affect the description of tails in the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) distribution. The lateral profile may be most relevant for the correct description of the pile-up, specially the cell signal correlation in minimum bias events. It will also affect the signal definition when noise cut and clustering are applied.

Energy resolution will affect for example the width of the invariant mass spectrum

Signal fluctuations in individual cells will probably again be critical for pile-up from minimum bias events as it will affect the RMS of pile-up noise and consequently the definition of the signal and its unfolding later on.

All those effects have to be quantified and the critical aspects have to be identified. Full simulation with different Monte Carlo shower models can be used. But there are limitations coming from the limited availability of models and the large computer time needed for the simulation of large samples of events. Fast parameterisation of showers give more flexibility in varying the model prediction but may have a limited validity in some detailed aspects like cell signal fluctuation or far away tails. They should anyhow help in identifying the critical points.

### Requirements derived from the precision needed in the response of electrons and photons

Physics at the LHC will set severe requirements on the Monte Carlo shower packages used to describe the response of the EM calorimeter.

The electromagnetic package should:

* give the correct e/\(\mu\) ratio.
* reproduce the energy deposited by electrons and photons in both the active and passive layers of the EM calorimeter, from 100 MeV (pile-up level) up to the TeV range.
* reproduce the longitudinal shower profile with the correct fluctuations and correlations between samplings. This is needed for particle identification.
* reproduce the lateral shower profile with the correct fluctuations, in particular in the fine eta-strips of the first compartment. This is needed mainly for particle identification.
* reproduce the shower energy resolution and position resolution over the full energy range mentioned above.

Test beam electron data will be available in the energy range from 5 GeV to about 300 GeV. They will allow to test the Monte Carlo capability of describing the EM calorimeter response. A detailed description of the accordion that includes gravitational sagging of absorbers is desirable, as well as inclusion of all the details of charge collection and pulse shaping.

The separation of electron and photons from hadrons and jets requires also a good description of the hadron response. Hence, the hadronic package should

* reproduce the energy deposited by pions in the EM calorimeter from 100 MeV (pile-up level) up to the TeV range.
* give the correct e/pi ratio
* reproduce the pion lateral and longitudinal profile.

Test beam data will be available from a few hundreds MeV (PS facility) up to 300 GeV. They will allow to test the Monte Carlo capability of describing the EM calorimeter response.

The required precision is better than 1 % for most measured calorimetric quantities.

### Requirements deriving from the impact of shower models on the muon system

#### 3.3.1 Introduction

The ATLAS muon spectrometer, with stand-alone triggering and momentum measurement capability, has been designed to ensure the largest possible discovery potential at the highest LHC luminosity. The background plays an important role in the performance of the system: the charged and neutral particles background coming both from minimum-bias events and from radiation have to be well understood. The background hits in the muon chambers can be classified into two categories:

* Primary collision products such as prompt muons from heavy particle decays and hadronic debris of calorimeter showers;
* Very low energy secondaries, mostly neutrons and photons, produced by the interactions of collision debris with the forward detector and machine elements, labelled as 'radiation background'.

#### 3.3.2 Primary collision background

The primary collision background consists of particles penetrating into the muon spectrometer through the calorimeter. They are correlated in time to the primary p-p interactions. Conventional sources of this background are muonic decays of light and heavy flavours, gauge boson decays, shower muons and hadronic punch-trough. The composition of the muon sample is plotted in fig. 20 as a function of the \(p_{T}\) of the muons.

At \(p_{T}\)\(\leq\)10 \(GeV\), the largest component of the background are muon from \(\pi\)/k decays in flight in the inner tracker cavity. At \(p_{T}\)\(\geq\)10 \(GeV\) the cross-section is dominated by charm and beauty decays. At \(p_{T}\)\(\geq\)30 \(GeV\), top and Z decay give a sizeable contribution. The contributions from shower muons and punch-trough is well below the irreducible level of prompt and decay muons, thanks to the absorption power of the calorimeter system.

Test-beam results on hadronic punch-trough and radiative muonsA complete set of measurements of the total punch-trough probabilities of hadronic showers and of the angular and momentum distributions of punch-trough muons, at various penetration depths, has been made by the RD5 Collaboration at CERN[20]. They have been compared with the of Monte Carlo shower models (GEANT-GHEISHA[2] and GEANT-FLUKA[3]). The comparison[21] indicates a good level of prediction power of both hadronic shower models with a better agreement at low momenta of the GEANT-FLUKA Monte Carlo. The RD5 Collaboration, formed to study topics related to muon detection at LHC, has also studied the production of electromagnetic secondaries accompanying the muons and its impact on the muon detectors. In fact high energy muons, of up to several hundred of GeV, lead to a significant production of electromagnetic secondaries( knock-on electrons,bremsstrahlung and pair production). The radiation of secondaries, near the muon track, could spoil the precision of the muon track measurements. Dedicated test-beam studies of muons accompanied by electromagnetic showers from 50 GeV up to 300 GeV were performed and compared with the predictions of GEANT-GHEISHA Monte Carlo. The results of this study show that the e.m. showers accompanying high energy muons in dense materials can affect a sizeable fraction of the muon tracks above 100 GeV/c; the Monte Carlo simulation agrees well with the data up to 300 GeV/c muons and the distribution of additional hits around the muon tracks is well reproduced [22].

#### 3.3.3 Low energy particle background

Radiation background consists mostly of neutrons and photons in the 1 MeV range, produced by secondary interactions with the forward calorimeters, the beam pipe and machine elements. The low energy neutrons escape the absorber and produce a gas of low energy photons through n-\(\gamma\) processes. This background enters into the spectrometer from all directions and is not any longer correlated in time to the primary p-p interaction. Typical muon detector efficiencies for photons are at the level of 1 %, those for neutrons one order of magnitude smaller. In spite of these low sensitivities, the low-energy neutral particle background is dominating the counting rates in most areas of the spectrometer.

Monte Carlo simulationNeutron and photon fluences have been computed for the ATLAS detector and experimental hall with the stand-alone FLUKA Monte Carlo program[24]. An extensive effort has been made to evaluate them through a very accurate shower simulation, from minimum bias production down to thermal neutron and capture \(\gamma\) rays. Details about the FLUKA code and its physical models, as well as benchmarks

Figure 20: Transverse momentum dependence of the inclusive muon cross-section.

for both electromagnetic and hadronic applications and neutron transport, can be found in reference[25]. Figures 21 to 24 show the rapidity-dependence of the expected counting rate in the three muon stations for the nominal luminosity of L=10\({}^{34}\)\(cm^{-2}\)\(sec^{-1}\). The curves labelled 'neutral' correspond to neutron and photon induced hits. Those labelled 'charged' contain all charged-particles contributions: \(\delta\) rays, muon-associated electromagnetic shower debris and the hadrons decaying to soft muons in the inner-tracker cavity and within the shower development in the calorimeter.

The neutral-induced background rate has been obtained combining the computed fluences with the energy-dependence of the chamber sensitivity. The total counting rate for all stations is shown in fig. 24. For the innermost chambers, it rises from 10 \(Hz/cm^{2}\) in the central region to almost 1 \(KHz/cm^{2}\) at the highest rapidity. These rates have been calculated with the shielding configuration TP32 and have been published in the Muon Technical Design Report[23]. Contributions to uncertainties in the above rates are:

* the sum of the uncertainties of the total p-p cross-section and of the multiplicity produced in the primary collisions, estimated at \(\pm\)30 %;
* the limited knowledge of the showering process in the absorber, and of the (n,\(\gamma\)) cross-sections could modify the fluences by a factor up to 2.5;
* the comparison of simulation results and laboratory measurements on chamber sensitivities suggests an error on these numbers of a factor 1.5.

A conservative linear superposition of these uncertainties yields a factor of five. The ATLAS muon instrumentation must therefore be designed to operate at high luminosity allowing for a safety factor of five on the background rate.

Impact of low energy neutrons and photons background on the muon systemHigh particle fluxes in the muon system have a major impact on the spectrometer performances. They influence primarily:

* Trigger system: a large background flux produces fake muons and thus increases the LVL1 trigger rate.
* Detector parameters: rate capability, granularity, ageing and radiation hardness.
* Muon momentum measurements: reconstruction algorithms must be carefully optimised to cope with the difficult background conditions, and therefore insure a correct reconstruction of the \(p_{T}\) of the muons.

Muon trigger rateTo understand the crucial importance of a correct radiation background simulation let us see the impact on the muon LVL1 trigger rate[23]. The low energy radiation background induces accidental coincidences in the trigger chambers due to a high level of random hits. This fake-trigger rate depends on the neutral background rate and composition, the size of the coincidence window and the coincidence time gate. To calculate this fake trigger rate, the neutral background has been classified in two categories:

* mainly electrons produced by Compton scattering of photons from n-\(\gamma\) reactions
- which is estimated to be about 5 \(Hz/cm^{2}\);
* correlated noise produced by charged particles that can cross adjacent trigger chambers, estimated to about 4 \(Hz/cm^{2}\) in the barrel and 7 \(Hz/cm^{2}\) in the end-caps.

The time gate to form a coincidence in a trigger chamber doublet used for this rate calculation is 25 ns for both the barrel and the end-cap detectors. Figure 25 shows the background-induced accidental trigger rates as a function of the luminosity, compared with rates expected from b- and c- quarks and from hadron decays in flight. The trigger rate have been evaluated assuming in one case the nominal background level and in a second case the background increased by a factor 10 or 5 to account for background uncertainties. The redundancy of the system, combined with the good time resolution ensures an accidental trigger rate below the physics rate, assuming the shielding configuration TP32.

#### 3.3.4 Conclusion

The present undergoing work on the ATLAS design optimisation and engineering definition requires a constant monitor of the low-energy particle background rate due to the crucial implications on the muon system performance. It seems that the best MC to model this rate today is FLUKA. This speaks in favour of having FLUKA available in the general ATLAS simulation framework such as to provide a tool for the complete simulation of p-p interactions at 14 TeV, down to thermic neutron energies. The possibility to compare its prediction with a second Monte Carlo program, together with the possibility of specific comparisons with test-beam measurements, is also very welcome.

### Requirements deriving from the impact of shower models on the inner detector

#### 3.4.1 Introduction

The ATLAS inner detector requirements on shower simulation arise from the need for a very realistic and detailed simulation of particles traversing the various materials and sensitive layers, which implies the inclusion of all physical processes that the particles could undergo down to very low energies (see below): any significant inaccuracy or missing process could become an important source for wrong estimates of the performance and potential of the inner detector, since it could result in an incorrect evaluation of the

Figure 25: Muon and accidental trigger rates as a function of luminosity for low(top) and high(bottom) thresholds in the barrel(left) and end-cap(right).

occupancy, of the saturation of the detector read-out, or of the correlations due to pile-up. The level of accuracy required in the tracking can be estimated taking into account the characteristics of the inner detector components: the precision tracking elements, consisting of the silicon-pixel and silicon-microstrip (SCT) barrel layers and end-cap disks, and the continuous tracking elements, consisting of the barrel and end-cap Transition-Radiation-Tracker (TRT) detectors.

The simulation requirements for the inner detector are defined by the functionality if its components, i.e. accurate and efficient reconstruction of charged particle tracks in the solenoidal magnetic field and electron identification using transition radiation, and by the environment in which it will operate, i.e. high densities of charged and neutral particles and high neutron fluences, which all produce many hits in the sensitive detector elements.

A detailed understanding of the pattern recognition performance of the inner detector will therefore require a very accurate simulation of the dominant physical processes which can produce hits in its sensitive layers. These layers are most often very thin, e.g. 300 micron thick silicon sensors or 4 mm diameter straw tubes filled with a Xenon gas mixture. The precision detectors are also very granular (50 to 80 micron pitch in R-phi). Both these features have an important impact on the required level of accuracy for the simulation. In addition, the amount of material in the ATLAS inner detector is very large, both in terms of radiation length and of interaction length. This also has an important impact on the required level of accuracy for the simulation.

Given the functionality and environment described above, it is straightforward to enunciate the processes which need to be treated with special care in the simulation:

* ionisation energy losses and delta-ray production;
* delta-ray propagation;
* multiple scattering;
* photon conversions and electron bremsstrahlung;
* hadronic interactions;
* transition radiation and synchrotron radiation;
* neutron processes.

In the following, the requirements on the simulation of the most crucial physical processes listed above are described in more detail, with a first attempt at defining the level of accuracy needed.

#### 3.4.2 Ionisation (\(dE/dx\)) in thin layers

Different requirements arise from the silicon (pixel and microstrip) and the gaseous (TRT) detectors:

\(\bullet\) Silicon detectors: the pixel detectors have a resolution of \(\sim\) 12 \(\mu\)m, not very different from the SCT resolution of \(\sim\) 20 \(\mu\)m. To define the energy cutoff, i.e. the particle energy at which the particle tracking is stopped and all its residual energy is locally released, these values must be taken into account. The stopping of the tracking of a particle which has a residual range larger than the resolution will lead to a wrong estimate of the occupancy.

In the silicon, a 100 keV proton has a residual range of the order of a micron, while a 100 keV pion has a residual range of about ten microns; for electrons of the same energy, this range is as large as about fifty microns, well above the detector resolution. Even the choice of a 10 keV energy cutoff for electrons could cause a significant inaccuracy in the estimates of the occupancy, since their range is comparable to the detector resolution.

Another important point to be considered are the electronic thresholds: the electronic threshold in the pixel read-out will be about 7 keV: any energy release exceeding this value, due to a single track or to pile-up of several tracks, should be simulated, in order to estimate the occupancy as accurately as possible. The SCT electronic threshold, which is almost 20 keV, sets less stringent requirements in this case.

\(\bullet\) TRT detector: it consists of gaseous proportional straw tubes, where the residual range of particles is orders of magnitude larger than in solid detectors, as can be easily understood if the densities of the two detector types are compared. The residual range of a 100 keV proton is of the order of a millimetre. The TRT intrinsic drift-time resolution has been measured to be \(\sim\) 170 \(\mu\)m, and the electronic threshold of 200 eV is much lower than that of the silicon detectors. In addition, an accurate simulation of the TRT drift-time performance and occupancy requires a \(dE/dx\) simulation which generates and follows each primary cluster in the straw gas, i.e. at the level of 10 eV or so. Such detailed simulation tools exist and should be part of the future simulation package for the inner detector.

In any event, it is clear that the TRT detector will impose the most critical requirements on the \(dE/dx\) simulation, owing to the reasons described above and to the electron identification capabilities using transition radiation (see below). The production of delta-rays in the keV range is the main source of background to transition radiation signals. Delta-rays must therefore be accurately produced in the gas itself, but also in the surrounding materials, since it has been shown in test-beam measurements that 10-15 % of the observed differential \(dE/dx\) spectrum in the few keV range is due to delta-rays produced outside the straw gas.

#### 3.4.3 Hadronic interactions

The amount of material in the inner detector corresponds to a total of \(\sim\) 30% of an interaction length in the worst region. A significant fraction of low-energy charged pions therefore undergo hadronic interactions in the active volume of the inner detector and cannot be reconstructed. It is therefore essential to include as accurately as possible all hadronic processes which can affect the reconstruction efficiency of the incoming hadron and/or modify the occupancy of the sensitive detector elements in the vicinity.

In the GEANT 3.21 version, different packages can be activated to simulate hadronic interactions. A comparison has been performed between GEANT-FLUKA and the GEANT-CALOR package: to produce a significant number of interactions within a reasonable CPU time, the amount of material in the detector supports was considerably increased, and the produced particles have been tracked through their subsequent physical processes down to the minimum GEANT cutoff of 10 keV. In order to better understand the differences between the two different hadronic packages, electromagnetic processes were turned off, given that their handling in GEANT does not depend on the chosen hadronic package.

In Fig. 26, the distribution of the particles produced in the two packages are compared. The most relevant discrepancies have been found in the neutron and proton yields from the two packages: the number of neutrons and protons produced is a factor of two larger in GEANT-CALOR than in GEANT-FLUKA. Their momentum distributions can be compared in Fig. 27. Most of these particles are of very low energy, and consequently produce large energy losses in the sensitive layers. The nuclear break-up, with the subsequent very large energy release originating from the nucleus evaporation, must be simulated as accurately as possible, since it produces a localised increase of the occupancy, and the digitisation of evaporation tracks can induce electronic saturation. The pattern recognition programs will also have to deal with these occurrences, and their efficiency will be affected by them.

#### 3.4.4 Transition radiation and synchrotron radiation

These processes are of interest to identify electrons in the energy range from 1 GeV to \(\sim\) 100 GeV. Neither exists in GEANT 3. Over the years, many transition radiation detectors have been optimised, built and operated in various machines. This has led to the very detailed and accurately calibrated simulation packages for the generation, transport

and absorption of X-rays from transition radiation, which are used in ATLAS and other experiments.

The requirements on the simulation of transition radiation are almost as stringent as those for \(dE/dx\). They can be extracted to a large extent from [26].

#### 3.4.5 Neutron Fluences

In the present simulations for the ATLAS detector, the large neutron fluences expected throughout the detector are predicted using a stand-alone version of FLUKA. This method has turned out to be the only way to evaluate the impact of these low-energy neutrons on the detector occupancies (see e.g. [28]).

However, the neutron background cannot be studied in a direct way, by merging hits possibly originating from their interactions to those originating from the primary particles. Moreover, the geometry description adopted in the stand-alone package is not as detailed as nor necessarily consistent with the description implemented in the complete GEANT 3 simulation. Obviously, possible inconsistencies could result in wrong predictions concerning the impact of the neutron background.

This unsatisfactory situation can only be resolved by integrating the simulation of background neutrons into the overall simulation package.

Figure 27: Momentum distribution for neutrons (a) and protons (b) produced in GEANT-CALOR package (solid line) and in GEANT-FLUKA package (dotted line).

#### 3.4.6 Calorimeter backsplash

Backsplash from early showers in the electromagnetic calorimeters can affect the occupancy of the outermost tracking layers. Measurements performed at the SPS have shown that GEANT 3 underestimates the hit multiplicities from backsplash by factors of up to 2 [27].

Although large effects of this type have only been seen for high-energy electrons, it would be desirable to improve the description of back-scattering processes causing so-called backsplash in the inner detector volume.

#### 3.4.7 Conclusion

The inner detector sets its own stringent requirements on the shower simulation, in particular on the level of detail needed for the interactions of individual particles, down to very low energies.

Any significant inaccuracy in the details of the simulation or missing physical processes would not only affect the evaluation of the pattern-recognition and electron identification capabilities of the inner detector, but would also impair the detailed evaluation and understanding of the potential of the inner detector in the difficult environment expected at the LHC.

## 4 Outlook

Calorimetric measurements set stringent requirements on the global features of shower simulations. The understanding of the performance of the inner detector and the muon system and their background add further specific requirements on individual particle response and neutron and photon fluences.

The sector of the shower models where more effort seems to be required is the hadronic one. The hadronic shower models that have been available so far for the simulation of the various calorimeters that compose the calorimetry at ATLAS are the models interfaced with GEANT3 and the standalone FLUKA model. Differences between the predictions from the various models and comparison with existing test beam data have been reviewed. Requirements on MC have been put forward by the different detector communities and first attemps of a quantitative evaluation have been presented. More work is needed for clarifying the requirements and evaluating what is the level of Monte Carlo accuracy in the realm of shower models that is needed by ATLAS. It is however already clear that the requirements are very stringent and the level of accuracy is in many instances significantly higher than the one we get today using the GEANT3 program with the hadronic shower models available in it.
