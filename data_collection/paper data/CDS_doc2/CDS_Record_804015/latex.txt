**Abstract**

**A fast monitoring method to determine electronic noise level and single tube efficiency on the Monitored Drift Tube chambers is introduced and applied to 2003 and 2004 data collected on the H8 beam line at CERN. A more refined measurement of the single tube and of the track segment efficiencies that makes use of the Resistive Plate Chambers as reference detector is also described and performed.**Introduction

The test set up in the H8 CERN area includes 12 Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) chambers organized in one barrel sector (6 chambers) and one end-cap octant (6 chambers). The barrel sector includes two adjacent towers of large chambers positioned at an angle of 15 degrees with respect to the direction orthogonal to the H8 beam. Each barrel tower includes two Barrel Inner Large chambers (BIL), two Barrel Middle Large chambers (BML) and two Barrel Outer Large chambers (BOL). The chambers are then classified with an index (1 or 2) which is related to the position of the tower with respect to the coordinate perpendicular to the beam direction (1 is the one closer to the "Saleve" side and 2 to the "Jura" one). The BML and the BOL chambers are equipped with their partner Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) whose function in ATLAS is to provide the muon trigger signal and to measure the coordinate of tracks along the MDT tubes. In standard running condition two kind of trigger are available: a coincidence of two small 10x10 cm\({}^{2}\) scintillators that are used to trigger on the beam core and a coincidence of two large 100x60 cm\({}^{2}\) scintillators in anti-coincidence with the small 10x10 cm\({}^{2}\), that is used to trigger on the beam halo. All the analyzed data have been collected with the large scintillator trigger hereafter referred to as "hodoscope" trigger. A more detailed description of the set up can be found in [1]. This set up is meant to be a test bed for the full ATLAS muon system integration and commissioning. In order to check the correct functioning of the MDT chambers a fast and simple method to measure the efficiency and the electronic noise of all drift tubes is needed. In this note a simple method based on comparison of counting rates of different MDT channels that makes use of the time and charge information is described. This method has the advantage of being independent on the tracking and calibration of the drift tubes and can therefore be applied online at any monitoring level. The H8 set up gives also the possibility to measure the tracking efficiency of the MDT chambers by using the RPC chambers as an external tracker to define muon tracks that have crossed the MDT active region.

The note is organized as follows. In Section 2 the data samples and the software codes used in this analysis are listed. In Section 3 the method to determine single-tube noise and efficiency is described and a fast pattern recognition method to verify the validity of the results is introduced. The noise and efficiency results for all the MDT tubes are given in Sections 4 and 5 respectively. A more refined method to determine the MDT single tube and track-segment efficiencies, based on muon tracks reconstructed with the RPC, is described in Section 6 together with the results obtained on the H8 setup. Conclusions are drawn in Section 7.

## 2 The H8 data sample and analysis software

The analyses described in this note have been performed on a set of runs collected with the hodoscope trigger setup. The list of the analyzed samples is reported in Tab. 1.

In order to check the influence of the RPC signals on the MDT noise level part of the runs were taken with the RPC low voltage and acquisition switched off and part switched on. For some of the runs two radioactive sources were placed in front of BML and BOL chambers respectively. The analyses have been performed in the ATHENA framework and the track-segment reconstruction has been performed with the MOORE program [2].

## 3 Single-tube noise and efficiency analysis methods

In the H8 setup the beam profile is characterized by an intense core with an RMS of about 3 cm and a quite extended beam halo with an RMS of the order of about 100 cm. The H8 muon trigger setup allows triggering on both beam components. In order to study the single-tube efficiency on a large number of channels the beam halo trigger based on a large hodoscope is better suited. With this setup the beam profile is expected to have a quite smooth shape over a large fraction of the chambers. This should be similar to the ATLAS situation where on a single chamber scale the muon illumination is expected to be quite uniform. The basic observation that is at the basis of this method is that tubes that are aligned with respect to the beam muon direction are expected to count

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Run & Date & Conditions \\ \hline

the same number of tracks. This concept can be extended to ATLAS where different chamber regions covering the same solid angle are expected to count the same number of muons. Under this assumption inefficient channels will show up as a deficit of counts with respect to the corresponding tubes in neighbouring layers. Noisy channels will show an excess of counts. In order to better distinguish electronic noise hits from beam muons the method proposed here uses the fact that the MDT front end (FE) electronics is able to provide in addition to the drift time measurement also the measurement of the integrated charge in a fixed time interval after the time threshold crossing. These two measurements can be used to disentangle the electronics noise from the genuine signals generated by crossing muons. Most of the electronics noise is characterized by very short pulses that will be measured by the FE ADC as a small charge, typically below the ADC pedestal corresponding of about 40 counts. The noise is also expected to be randomly distributed in time with respect to the trigger time provided by the hodoscope. In H8 in a quite large fraction of events out of time muons are crossing the MTD chambers in the time window opened by the triggering muon. In order to have a correct evaluation of the electronic noise and of the tube efficiency also these muons have to be identified. A good sample of pure electronics noise can therefore be selected by requiring a small ADC charge and a drift time below the t\({}_{0}\) value (time corresponding to a triggered muon crossing the tube wire) or above the t\({}_{max}\) (time corresponding to a triggered muon passing close to the tube wall). On the contrary an enriched sample of genuine muon signals is characterized by a minimum ionizing particle charge and TDC time in the range between t\({}_{0}\) and t\({}_{max}\). The out of time muons can be identified by requiring out of time hits and measured charge above the ADC pedestal. On the base of the ADC and TDC information we make use of the following three categories of hits:

1. ADC \(>\) 40, t\({}_{0}\) \(<\) TDC \(<\) t\({}_{max}\);
2. ADC \(<\) 40, TDC \(<\) t\({}_{0}\) or TDC \(>\) t\({}_{max}\);
3. ADC \(>\) 40, TDC \(<\) t\({}_{0}\) or TDC \(>\) t\({}_{max}\).

In order to verify the reliability of these assumptions a simple pattern recognition method has been developed. For each event the method can distinguish the presence of a track and isolated hits. A track is selected by requiring in the barrel chambers at least 17 out of 20 layers with hits in a road of \(\pm\) 2 tubes aligned with the beam direction. Isolatedhits are defined as hits which are found in one or at most two consecutive layers. Some events are characterized by the presence of two tracks, one of them is usually out of the hodoscope trigger region and contains at least two hits with TDC out of the time window opened by the triggering track.

In table 2 the fraction of the three categories of hits belonging to "in time" tracks, "out of time" tracks and isolated hits, is reported for the Run 1559. From the table it can be seen that most of the hits in time and with ADC\(>\)40 (category 1) belong to a track, so this kind of hits can be used to determine the efficiency, while most of the hits out of time and with ADC\(<\)40 (category 2) are isolated hits, so they can be used to determine the electronic noise. Category 3 are physical hits out of time mostly produced by track uncorrelated to the trigger time.

The method to measure the efficiency and noise here presented is very fast and requires only a rough evaluation of the t\({}_{0}\) and t\({}_{max}\) values. For this reason such a method could be applied at the monitoring level to get a fast evaluation of noisy or largely inefficient channels in the ATLAS experiment.

## 4 Single-tube noise results

The purpose of this study is to measure the noise in normal condition (Run 1559) and to investigate the possible influence of electromagnetic interference of the RPC by comparison with Run 700090 taken with RPC High and Low Voltage off. The background of random hits, uncorrelated to tracks, due to \(\gamma\)-ray source radiation has also been measured from Run 1220, in which the chambers BML and BOL were exposed to two radioactive sources of Co\({}^{60}\) - 173 MBq (\(\gamma\)-ray sources in the MeV range).

For the Run 1559 the distribution of the noise rates for each channel are reported in Fig. 1, each histogram being relative to a chamber (BIL1, BIL2, BML1, BML2, BOL1, BOL2 ). The plots show that most of the channels cluster around an average value,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & Track in time & Track out of time or small segments & Isolated hit \\ \hline
1 & 71\% & 26.2\% & 2.2\% \\ \hline
2 & 2\% & 9.7\% & 88\% \\ \hline
3 & 6.5\% & 84.5\% & 8.7\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Relation between hit classification based on TDC and ADC measurements and the one obtained with the pattern recognition described in the text.

while a few channels are in a tail of the distribution and have much higher rates. In order to disentangle noisy channels from the average noise behaviour of the chamber an iterative algorithm has been developed. The average of all the noise rates is calculated and if a channel has a value higher than 8 times the average it is considered noisy and excluded from the average, that is calculated again; the procedure is repeated until no more channels are above the cut.

For all the channels below this cut the average is calculated for each chamber, layer by layer. The results are reported in Fig. 2, separately for chambers BIL1, BML1, BOL1 and chambers BIL2, BML2, BOL2. The data show that an average rate of 40 Hz is observed both in the case of RPC on (Run 1559) and RPC off (Run 700090), indicating that the

RPC signals and read-out do not induce noise on MDT. In Run 1220, with the sources on, an increase of the rate is observed: this has a physical origin and is due to low energy tail of the \(\gamma\)-\(e\) Compton interaction, causing very short signals in the MDT's. In Fig. 3 the number of noisy tubes per layer is shown. From the list of the noisy channels it has been seen that most of them are the same in all the runs.

In the case of the sources on (Run 1220), the rate of hits with ADC < 40 are not sensitive to the full radiation originating from the sources, but only to the very low energy end of the produced electron spectrum in the tubes. In order to check the full rate due to the sources, the average rate per layer has been evaluated for all the hits without applying the ADC cuts. The results reported in Fig. 4 show that the sources cause an increase of rate from about 1 kHz to about 6 kHz.

The noise analysis program has been applied to data taken in the 2004 test beam run. It has to be noted that in the Run 600396 there is a not negligible number of hits with ADC count equal to zero and out of the time window. This is mainly due to the fact that in 2004 the FE electronics has been operated in "edge mode" and for hits with the leading edge coming close to the end of the time spectra the trailing edge can be lost. This population of hits was absent in the 2003 data, and they are not taken into account for the evaluation of the electronic noise. The results of the electronic noise and of the out-of-time muon background are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 respectively, where also the last year data are reported for comparison. It has to be stressed that the noise level depends exponentially on the value of the TDC thresholds. Even though all the mezzanine have been set to the same "nominal" threshold, the "effective" threshold can fluctuate quite a lot between the channels of the same mezzanine (up to \(\pm 6\) mV). The level of the electronic noise in the 2004 data is higher than in the 2003 data by about a factor 10 in all the layers of the barrel chambers, and is now in the 200-300 Hz range. This could be explained by the fact that the thresholds were different in the 2003 (-44 mV) and the 2004 (-40 mV) analyzed runs.

As final remark it has to be stressed that the electronic noise values found in this analysis are much smaller than the total counting rate of the physical background, due to thermal neutrons, photons and charged particles in ATLAS, that is expected to be in the range (10-100) kHz.

## 5 Single-tube efficiency results

The analysis of the channel efficiency has been performed on the 2003 test beam Runs 1559, 1220 and on the 2004 test beam Run 600396. An example of the beam profile in successive tube layers is shown in Fig. 7 as determined by the rate of hits selected in the time window and with ADC \(>\) 40. The shift of the profile from one layer to the other is caused by the angle of the beam (\(\simeq 15^{\circ}\)) with respect to the direction perpendicular to the chamber plane. If we apply to the various layers an appropriate tube number shift we get, as is shown in Fig. 8, good reproducibility between the profiles of the different layers with the exception of the regions where the beam intensity is changing on scales that are comparable with the MDT tube size (for example at the border of the hodoscope trigger acceptance).

The comparison of the hit number for tubes belonging to different layers, aligned with the beam direction, is used to evaluate the channel efficiency, in a way that does not depend on the actual intensity profile of the beam. In Fig. 9 an example of rate of aligned tubes is shown for all the layers of the BIL, BML and BOL chambers.

The result for Run 1559 is reported in Fig. 10, where the quantity \(x=\frac{\langle n_{i}-m\rangle^{2}}{m}\) for all the tubes is plotted. In Fig. 11 the values of the variable \(y=n_{i}/m\) are plotted as a function of the tube number for the same run. We select only the region covered by the trigger hodoscope. A channel is considered inefficient if \(x>25\), which corrisponds to a

\(5\sigma\) cut on the counting rate respect to the mean value \(m\), and if \(y<0.7\). Channels with \(y=0\) are classified as"dead channels". In this figure the dead channels and the inefficient channels are shown in red. The number of inefficient channels, in the six chambers of the barrel sector, is reported for the various runs in Table 3, together with the number of dead channels.

In order to investigate the behaviour of the inefficient channels, a few of them have been studied in more detail. In Fig. 12 the plots of TDC versus the event number and the number of hits with ADC\(<\)40 and ADC\(>\)40 are reported for one channel with efficiency found to be 42%, in the last year data. It is clear from Fig. 12 that the channel behaves in a discontinuos way, going to zero efficiency at some time and restarting to work later.

The fraction of the time in which the channel is not efficient explains well the measured inefficiency. The effect described above, found to occur with not negligible frequency last year, was caused by short pulses affecting the correct functioning of the ASD MDT FE chip operated in pair mode. In the Run 1220, taken with the chambers BML2 and BOL2 exposed to radiative sources, such disfunctioning was found to be very much more frequent. An example from Run 1220 is shown in Fig. 13.

For the Run 600396, taken in 2004, a few selected channels with low efficiency, have been looked at with the same method. An example is reported in Fig. 14. In this case there is no discontinuity in the performance of the channels. In 2004 run the ASD operated no longer in pair-mode but in edge-mode, in order to eliminate the fa

last year. The EMS chambers, being very noisy at the beginning of the 2004 run, 1 have been analyzed to check that the problem has been solved with the new mode operation. In Fig. 15 the distribution of the ADC counts is shown for the first 25 channels of the layer 1 multilayer 1 of the EMS chamber. It can be seen that this chamber has a large population of hits with low ADC, corresponding to a very high noise level. For the same channels of the EMS, the rate of good hits, in time and with ADC\(>\)40, is shown as a function of the event number in Fig. 16. From the figure it can be seen that the behaviour is uniform in time for all the channels.

## 6 Track segment efficiency

An important figure of merit of the MDT chambers is the track segment efficiency. The muon tracking software is expected to reconstruct in each muon station a track segment that is then combined to form a muon track. A track segment is reconstructed by a straight-line fit to the MDT hits in the plane orthogonal to the wire direction. In order

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Run & BIL1 & BIL2 & BML1 & BML2 & BOL1 & BOL2 \\ \hline

\end{table}
Table 3: Number of inefficient/dead channels in the trigger region for each chamber of the barrel.

to determine in an unbiased way the track segment efficiency, an independent tracking must be used to select events in which a muon track is expected to cross an active region of the MDT chambers. This is achieved by means of the RPC chambers.

### Sample selection

An RPC segment is reconstructed using the nominal position of the strips. A simple clustering is performed for events with one or two contiguous hits in the expected time window (TW) for each of the 6 RPC planes. The TW is defined as a three sigma's window around the RPC time distribution (see Fig. 17). By using the least square method, the

coefficients of the linear fit in the \(yz\) and \(yx^{2}\) planes are then determined:

\[z = \alpha\,y+\beta \tag{1}\] \[x = \gamma\,y+\delta \tag{2}\]

Only events with a good minimization (\(\chi^{2}/\mathrm{ndf}<5\)) in both view are considered for the analysis. Most of the not instrumented MDT channels are not selected by this requirement, except a region of the BIL. In order to exclude also this area, we restrict the acceptance for this chamber considering only events with \(\beta<40\) cm.

The track segment efficiency was evaluated only for Run 1559 (hodoscope trigger). To avoid events where the FE is affected by the pair-mode operation (see par. 5), we have reduced the statistics to a smaller sample (Tab. 4): all the barrel MDT channels were checked, and the number of events used for each chamber was stopped when the first FE failure appeared. During the scan of the chambers some dead channels, listed in Tab. 5, were discovered.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline MDT chamber & Number of events used \\ \hline BIL & 60k \\ BML & 50k \\ BOL & 35k \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure 17: Time distribution of the 12 RPC readout planes.

In order to see if the presence of the background modifies the performances of the tracking, we studied also the runs with the radioactive sources. Unfortunately, due to the higher level of short pulses for these runs, it was not possible to find a stable period where all the MDT channels were properly working at the same time (Fig. 18).

### Tube efficiency

The tube efficiency of the BML chamber was studied at first. The Z\({}_{\rm RPC}\), which is the RPC fit \(z\) coordinate extrapolated to the BML surface, has been computed and then for each BML layer the \(z\) coordinate (Z\({}_{\rm tube}\)) was reconstructed using the nominal geometry of the chamber and the layout of the H8 test beam setup:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c c c|} \hline MDT chamber & Multilayer & Layer & Wire \\ \hline BIL & 1 & 2 & 1 \\ BIL & 2 & 4 & 10 \\ BOL & 2 & 2 & 10 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure 18: TDC counts _vs_ event number for some channels of Run 1220, taken with radioactive sources.

\[{\rm Z_{tube}=Z_{off}+2\;R_{tube}\left(N_{tube}-1\right)} \tag{3}\]

where \({\rm Z_{off}}\) is the offset of the first wire of the considered layer, \({\rm R_{tube}}\) is the tube radius and \({\rm N_{tube}}\) is the tube number.

A gaussian fit to the distribution of \({\rm Z_{tube}-Z_{RPC}\;(\Delta Z)}\) shows that the mean values grow with the increasing layer number as expected, while the width (\(\sim 1\) cm) is dominated by the MDT tube diameter (Fig. 19). To evaluate the tube efficiency, for each event with a good RPC track, an MDT hit is searched within a 5 \(\sigma\)'s window on \(\Delta Z\). The MDT hits have to satisfy the requirement: \(t_{0}<{\rm TDC}<t_{\rm max}\). The results for each layer as a function of \({\rm Z_{RPC}}\) are shown in Fig. 20, while the mean values are reported in Tab. 6. The overall value is:

\[\varepsilon_{\rm tube}=(99.88\pm 0.02)\%. \tag{4}\]

### Check of the calibrations

In order to evaluate the tracking efficiency, it is also important to have a set of reliable calibrations. The calibration data produced by the Rome3 group with the _calib_ package [3] has been used.3 A fast check of the space-time relation (\(r\)-\(t\) relation) was also done. Some large discontinuity in the BOL \(r\)-\(t\) relation has been found as shown in Fig. 21. This is true for both the \(\eta\) sectors of the chamber (see Fig. 22). For this reason the \(r\)-\(t\) relation obtained for the BIL chambers have also been used for the BOL.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Layer \# & \(\epsilon_{\rm tube}\) \\ \hline
1 & \((99.90\pm 0.05)\%\) \\
2 & \((99.88\pm 0.05)\%\) \\
3 & \((99.94\pm 0.04)\%\) \\
4 & \((99.84\pm 0.06)\%\) \\
5 & \((99.88\pm 0.05)\%\) \\
6 & \((99.86\pm 0.05)\%\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The study of the residuals is done for events with just one single track, where there is a clear correspondence between the track itself and the associated hits. In order to have meaningful results with a small binning along the drift distance \(\rm R_{drift}\), it is important to have a large statistical sample. For this reason, we require a looser sample selection, based only on MDT information. We first select data with a single track in each MDT chamber. For these events, the distributions of the difference of the \(\beta\) variable evaluated with two MDT chambers are reported in Fig. 23. They are not well centered at zero, with a spread which is around 1 cm. A further three \(\sigma\)'s cut around the peak is then applied on both distributions.

The mean values and the RMS's of the track residuals have been evaluated as a function of the drift distance \(\rm R_{drift}\) for each layer of the three MDT chambers, by means of a fit to a gaussian distribution. The results are reported in Figs. 24, 25 and 26. The residual mean values are, with some exceptions, within 50 \(\mu\)m and the RMS's are about 200 \(\mu\)m near the wire, going down to 50 \(\mu\)m at the cell boundaries. In the BML there

In the \(\Delta\)R(BIL-BOL) distribution the values corresponding to negative drift distances for the BOL chambers are not displayed.

are some unexpected structures at R\({}_{\rm drift}\)/2 while in the BOL the results near the wire are worse compared to the other two chambers.

### Definition of the acceptance region

To count how often a muon that crosses an MDT chamber is reconstructed, we define an acceptance region where to look for a track segment relying on the track identified by RPC. In Fig. 27 the correlations and the differences of the \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) and Z variables evaluated with RPC and BML are shown. Both Z\({}_{\rm RPC}\) and Z\({}_{\rm MDT}\) are evaluated on the BML surface. Although a clear correlation is visible also for the \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) variables, we will require in the following an acceptance region based on Z since its resolution (\(\sim 4.5\) mm) is dominated by the RPC granularity.

Similarly, in Fig. 28 the correlation and difference for Z are shown for both BIL and BOL chambers. Also here Z is evaluated on the BML surface; this is done to preserve the precision on the coordinate evaluation, since 4 out of 6 RPC planes are positioned closed to BML MDT and their spatial resolution is worsen compared to the MDT. The \(\Delta\)Z resolution is of the same order of the value obtained for the BML.

Figure 22: Difference between the space-time relation of the two eta sector for BIL (up), BML (middle) and BOL (down) chambers.

window is then the same for the three chambers, corresponding to around a 6 \(\sigma\)'s region around the \(\Delta\)Z peak:

\[|\mathrm{Z_{MDT}-Z_{RPC}}|<3\ \mathrm{cm}. \tag{5}\]

### Efficiency evaluation

The track segments are built with the MOORE reconstruction program in the ATHENA release 7.3.0. Different parameters can be chosen to define a track segment: minimum number of hits, maximum chi-square of the fit and maximum distance of a hit from the expected track, also called \(\delta\)-ray cut. In this analysis different sets of parameters have been chosen:

1. \(\mathrm{N_{hit}\geq 4}\), \(\delta\)-ray \(<0.05\ \mathrm{cm}\), \(\chi^{2}<1000\)
2. \(\mathrm{N_{hit}\geq 4}\), \(\delta\)-ray \(<0.1\ \ \mathrm{cm}\), \(\chi^{2}<1000\)
3. \(\mathrm{N_{hit}\geq 4}\), \(\delta\)-ray \(<0.1\ \ \mathrm{cm}\), \(\chi^{2}<10\)

* N\({}_{\rm hit}\geq 5\), \(\delta\)-ray \(<0.1\) cm, \(\chi^{2}<10\)

By looking to the fit output parameters for the different cases, same general considerations can be done:

* in the majority of the cases only one single track satisfies the requirements of the algorithm;
* in the events with only one reconstructed track, the number of hits is 6 in the \(\sim 75\%\) of the cases and the \(\chi^{2}\) is good for all \(\delta\)-ray cuts;
* in the events with more tracks, the fraction of tracks with a smaller number of hits grows significantly and the \(\chi^{2}\) has higher tails for \(\delta\)-ray \(<0.1\) cm, while it remains good for \(\delta\)-ray \(<0.05\) cm.

The results of the track segment fit are shown in Fig. 29 for the BML chamber and for the two sets of parameters (d) and (e).

In Tabs. 7, 8 the overall tracking efficiencies are reported for N\({}_{\rm hit}\geq 4\) and N\({}_{\rm hit}\geq 5\) respectively. While in the first case the results are not sensitive to the variation of the \(\delta\)-ray and \(\chi^{2}\) parameters, they differ significantly by requiring at least 5 hits. The efficiencies

From the measurement of the tracking efficiency, the value of the hit efficiency (\(\varepsilon_{\rm hit}\)) can be extracted under the assumption of no correlation between hits. The track segment efficiency can be correlated to the single hit efficiency with a combinatorial formula of the

In Tab. 9 the track efficiencies evaluated for different values of \(\varepsilon_{\rm hit}\) are reported for both \(\rm N_{hit}\geq 4\) and \(\rm N_{hit}\geq 5\) and compared with the values of par. 6.5. As can be seen, there is a good consistency between expectations and measurements. The track efficiency obtained with the requirement \(\delta\)-ray \(<0.05\) cm, \(\chi^{2}<1000\) corresponds to \(\varepsilon_{\rm hit}=94.5\%\), while for \(\delta\)-ray \(<0.1\) cm the hit efficiency is 95.5% and 95.0% for \(\chi^{2}<1000\) and \(\chi^{2}<10\) respectively. These values are significantly lower than the hardware efficiency; this means that \(\varepsilon_{\rm hit}\) is dominated by hard \(\delta\)-rays.

Conclusions

A method to get a fast evaluation of inefficient and noisy channels has been described and applied to 2003 and 2004 test beam data. This method is based on simple comparison between adjacent tube and does not make use of track reconstruction algorithm and is therefore very fast and can be used at monitoring level. The results on the 2003 and 2004 data have shown a level of noise that is much lower then the noise expected from physics background in ATLAS. A few dead channels have been found while most of the inefficiencies were due to the faulty operating mode of the MDT FE electronics ("pair mode") causing the intermittent functioning of the TDC. On 2004 data the MDT FE electronics has been operated in "edge mode" and this behaviour has disappeared.

A more refined method to measure single-tube and track-segment efficiencies has been developed and applied to 2003 test beam data. This method exploits the RPC chambers that are used to build muon candidates and match them with MDT hits or track segments. The results of this study are that, once the problem related to the "pair mode" settings are removed, the single-tube efficiency is found to be very close to 100% and the track-segment efficiency is found to be compatible with a simple combinatoric computation once an hit inefficiency due to \(\delta\)-ray of the order of 5% is assumed.
