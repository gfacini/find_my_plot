## Abstract.

The properties of several versions of gas ionization calorimeter are analized by means of the simulation on the GEANT program. The energy and coordinate resolutions are obtained. Some versions fulfill the ATLAS requirements[1].

## 1 Introduction.

One of the detectors of the future ATLAS set-up is the forward calorimeter intended for the detection of the particles flow from a primary interaction in the pseudorapidity range \(3<|\eta|<5\). The forward calorimeter is situated at the distance \(\approx 15.4\) m from the central point of the set-up and its total length cannot exceed 2.5 m. The radius of the front calorimeter plane is about 1.5 m. The high pressure gas ionization calorimeter has been proposed for ATLAS set-up[2]. The satisfactory properties of such type calorimeters have been observed in the series of experiments [3,4] and simulations [5].

The aim of the given article is to analyse different design versions of the gas ionization calorimeter by means of the simulation on the GEANT program[6].

The width of gas gaps was chosen to be about 2 mm. This value is determined by the drift velocity of electrons in a gas medium to have fast enough time response. The outer diameter of a gas ionization tubes can be fixed at the value 6 mm with the wall thickness 1 mm. The tubes are oriented along the direction of incoming particles and they are situated at the vertices of a equilateral triangle with the length of the side L. The variety of tubes is organized into parallel rows or concentric circles. For the simulation purposegas ionization tubes are filled with the gas mixture (\(90\%Ar+10\%CF_{4}\)) under the pressure of P= 30 atm.

According to the early analysis the gas contamination in a tube calorimeter can lie in the range 10-25(%). That is why here we will analyse only two structural triangles with a side lengthes L= 0.8 cm and L= 1.15 cm. For these cases the gas contaminations equal 23% and 11%. The results for intermediate cases can be obtained by the linear interpolation on the gas contamination parameter.

Some comparisons of the simulation results with experimental ones are given in the Appendix where the values of the GEANT3.15 parameters are fixed. Most of the simulated amplitude distributions are not described by the Gaussian and we use here RMS values of histograms as the estimation of amplitude dispersions instead of the fitted ones. The energy resolution parameters from the expression

\[\frac{RMS}{E}=\frac{A}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus C.\]

are defined by the approximation of the simulated data. According to the requirements [1] imposed on the forward calorimeter this is to be

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{100\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 7\%.\]

As an absorber lead or iron material can be used in the calorimeter. The response amplitude of a calorimeter with the iron absorber is greater than for the calorimeter with a lead because of the length of electromagnetic showers in iron is 3 times greater than in lead. As a result the energy resolution can be improved for an iron calorimeter for incoming particles of moderate energies.

At the same time the iron calorimeter has a larger value of the constant term in the energy resolution than a lead calorimeter. The quantitative difference of these two materials are seen from the table 2, where the data are presented for the simulation of an idealized big calorimeter with a linear structure of the gas ionization tubes. The angle between the tubes axis and the flight direction of incoming particles is 5\({}^{0}\). One can see, that the difference in the value of the constant term in the energy resolution can achieve 5% for these two absorbers for hadron showers. Therefore the calorimeters discussedbelow can use both type of absorber material with the aim to exploit their different properties for electromagnetic and hadron showers.

The constant term in the energy resolution for hadrons can be evaluated with sufficiently good accuracy from the expression (see references [5,7]):

\[C=(14-25)\%\star(\frac{e}{h}-1)\]

instead of the fitted one.

The simulation was done for electrons and pions in the energy range (9-100) GeV. The particles uniformly cover the area 10*10 \(cm^{2}\) and come into analysed calorimeter at 2 values of radius R:

1) R= 35 (\(\theta=1.2^{0},\eta=4.3\)).

2) R= 105 (\(\theta=5.0^{0},\eta=3.1\)).

## 2 Versions of a forward calorimeter.

Among a series of gas ionization calorimeters there are three, that we consider as the main versions for a forward calorimeter.

### Version 1 (Cells with tubes).

The suggested calorimeter consists of the hexagonal cells with the outer diameter 9.6 cm (fig.2). Each cell contains the rows of gas ionization tubes run parallel to the beam axes in the lead absorber. The thickness of cell walls is 1 mm. Nevertheless the central point of incoming particles flow was chosen at the point between neighboring cells to take into account the possible influence of the walls onto the energy resolution of electromagnetic showers. To diminish the zero angle effect for incoming \(\gamma-\) quanta there is a layer of lead before the prototype situated at the distance 50 cm. The width of the layer is about 3 radiation lengths (2 cm). The purpose of the passive material is to create a flow of secondary particles with the broad angle distribution to diminish the position dependence of a signal value on the entry point of incoming particles. Besides there is a layer of iron with the thickness 3 cm at the distance 6 cm before the calorimeter due to mechanical structure of a calorimeter.

The simulation results are presented in the table 3. The constant term in the energy resolution expression for electrons is greater than 10% and it depends on the entry point of particles flow. This behavior can be explained by the energy resolution dependence on the incoming angle of particles[5]. Besides the amplitude ratio depends on the calorimeter radius also. It means that the jet energy resolution will depend on the entry point of jet particles. The ratio of normalized amplitudes A(100 GeV)/A(9 GeV) at two different energies deviates from unit in the range \((9-16)\%\) for hadrons and in the range \((19-25)\%\)) for electrons depending on the number of tubes in cells.

One can make the conclusion that this calorimeter type cannot be used as a forward calorimeter.

### Version 2 (Cells with parallel gas chambers).

The calorimeter is filled with the hexagonal cells ( 900 cells) which are consist of parallel absorber plates and gas ionization chambers. The latest achievements in the way of obtaining the fast signal from the usual layered structure of active and passive materials give the possibility to have the signal near 20 ns, that is necessary for the working conditions of the ATLAS set-up. The thickness of cell wall is 2 mm. The outer diameter of the cell is 9.6 cm. The width of a gap between absorber plates equals 4 mm. The signal is collected from the copper plates with the thickness 0.4 mm, which are installed in the middle of the gaps. The calorimeter cross-sections and its cell are presented in the fig.3. The variable parameters in the prototype are the material type of an absorber plates, their thickness, the thickness and material type of cell walls. To take into account the presence of dead zones in the calorimeter the central point of incoming particles flow is chosen between adjacent cells. The area of irradiation by incoming particles equals the cell square. For definiteness we consider here only those variants in which the type of absorber material and the plate thickness are the same along the cell length. The calorimeter is filled up with gas mixture (\(90\%Ar+10\%CF_{4}\)) at the gas pressure P\(=30\) atm. The calorimeter has 3 longitudinal sections with the lengthes \(1\lambda\), \(2\lambda\) and the rest. The full amplitude value is calculated by summing amplitudes from these sections with corresponding weight factors. These factors are determined through the minimization of the functional

\[F=\sum^{\mbox{\tiny$virnts$}}(E-\sum^{\mbox{\tiny$sections$}}w_{i}*A_{i})^{2}, \tag{2}\]where E- the energy of particles, \(A_{i}\) - amplitudes, \(w_{i}\)- weight factors.

It is necessary to notice that this method gives biased results for low energy particles[7]. One can see an example of the energy dependence of the first two weighting factors in the fig.4.

The results of the simulation are presented in the table 4. The value of the constant term in the energy resolution for electromagnetic showers has a strong dependence on the thickness of cell walls and its material. In the fig.5 one can see the amplitude distributions for incoming electrons with the energy E\(=25\) GeV. The influence of the wall material is entirely disappeared only for aluminium. Therefore the cells material has to be close to aluminium one to improve the energy resolution for electromagnetic showers. The value of the constant term for hadrons is greater for iron absorber compared with lead. For lead absorber the ratio of amplitudes for both types of particles is less than for the iron absorber.

The thickness of the absorber plates in the calorimeter has to be near to 2 cm than to 1 cm because of the average energy leakage is enlarged from \(\approx 1\%\) to \(\approx 2\%\) and the dispersion of the leakage distribution is enlarged from \(2\%\) to \(6\%\) for the energy of particles E\(=100\) GeV. (The energy leakage distribution for hadron showers has an exponential form). At the same time the thickness of absorber plates has to be as small as possible because of the amplitude nonlinearities of a signal for electromagnetic showers. Besides there is the constructive layer of passive material with the thickness 3 cm before the calorimeter. It seems that the thickness 2 cm for absorber plates is an optimal value.

It is necessary to notice that the energy leakage is enlarged for aluminium wall cells in the same manner as mentioned above. The effective interaction length alters in the range (19-25) cm for increasing energy value of incoming hadron particles and the thickness of absorber plates 2 cm without aluminium material.

From the table it is evident that the energy resolution does not depend on the calorimeter radius R.

According to the experimental data obtained for the TMP calorimeter[8] and high pressure ionization calorimeter[4] interesting results have been observed for the sampling calorimeter with aluminum-clad absorber plates. In this case the light material is used as a filter for slow electromagnetic particles and the difference between signal responses for hadrons and electrons is decreased.

In our case the same structure was simulated for each cell. The absorber plate with the total thickness 2 cm consists of lead plate (1.6 cm) covered with aluminum plates with thickness 0.2 cm. One can see from the table that the constant terms for this structure have the smalest values. The only deficiency is a large value of the effective interaction length (\(\lambda\) = 26-32 cm). Therefore with the presence of the aluminium material in a calorimeter it is necessary to enlarge the width of absorber plates or the total calorimeter length for these calorimeter type.

If we use the calorimeter without longitudinal sections then in the case of iron absorber plates the amplitude nonlinearity for hadrons is about 15% (the deviation of the ratio A(9 GeV)/A(100 GeV) from unit for normalized amplitudes), the same for lead absorber is 9%. In the case of the presence of longitudinal sections in the calorimeter these nonlinearities are disappeared because of the calibration procedure.

One can make the conclusion that some variants of this calorimeter type meet the ATLAS requirements.

### Version 3 (Hybrid calorimeter).

The next version of the forward calorimeter is an hybrid one. In this version each cell consists of two parts. First one consists of parallel ionization chambers and second one consists of gas ionization tubes parallel to the beam. Each cell has a hexagonal shape with the iron wall thickness 2 mm. The outer diameter of the cell is 9.6 cm with the common gas filling in both parts. The width of a gap between absorber plates in the first part equals 4 mm. The signal is collected from the copper plates with the thickness 0.4 mm, which are installed in the middle of the gaps. The calorimeter cross-sections and its cell are presented in the fig.6. The absorber type in the second part is lead and in the first part it can be lead or iron. Therefore the variable parameters in the prototype are the type of an absorber in the first part of cell and their thicknees, the number of absorber plates and the number of ionization tubes in the second part of cell. To take into account the presence of dead zones in the calorimeter the central point of incoming particles flow is chosen between adjacent cells. The area of irradiation by incoming particles equals the cell square.

The full signal amplitude from each cell is defined by the sum of 2 amplitudes with the corresponding weighting factors, determined from the minimization of functional (2).

The investigations of these calorimeter properties was carried out in two stages. First of all it is necessary to determine the total length of the layered structure. It can be done through the determination of the minimal energy resolution for hadrons.

In the fig.7 one can see the dependence of the energy resolution parameters A and C' from the expression (1) on the total length of the layered cell section. There were simulated two calorimeter types. First one - with lead absorber in both cell parts and with 127 tubes in the second cell part (L= 0.8 cm), and second - with iron absorber in the first cell part and with 91 tubes in the second cell part (L= 0.97 cm). The calorimeter radius of irradiation by the flow of incoming particles equals R= 30 cm. It is supposed that such determined optimal cell parameters do not depend on the calorimeter radius R. It follows from the fig.7 that the optimal value of the layered structure length is 2.5 \(\lambda\).

The second stage of the investigation is carried out for this length of the first section.

The results of simulations are presented in the table 5. The presence of the large constant term in the energy resolution for electrons has the same nature as in the second calorimeter version. Energy resolution for hadrons has the same average value as in the second calorimeter version with the 127 tubes (L=0.8 cm) in each cell, but the constant term is greater for this version in the case when there are 61 tubes (L= 1.15 cm) in cells. From the table it follows that the energy resolution does not depend on the calorimeter radius R. In the table there are also the data for the variant when we use the stainless tubes with the outer radius 0.8 cm and with the iron rod inside. The rod diameter is 0.4 cm and the tube wall thickness is 0.05 cm. The distance between these tubes is L= 1.15 cm that is we have 61 tubes in cell. One can see that for this variant the energy resolution is practically of the same value as in the case of the usual tubes with distance between them L= 0.8 cm (127 tubes in cell).

For the variants when we use aluminium hexagonal cells and lead absorber plates between aluminium sheets (thickness 2 mm) we have the smallest value of the constant term in the energy resolution. To the top of that if we use the aluminium tubes instead of stainless ones in cells the energy resolution does not change but we have a big value of energy leakage. One can make the conclusion that in this calorimeter version aluminium material can be used only in the first section of the cells. To decrease the energy leakage it is necessary to decrease the number of tubes in each cell.

The estimated values of amplitude nonlinearities are of the same values as in the case of the version 2.

One can make the conclusion that some variants of this calorimeter type meet the ATLAS requirements[1].

## 3 Coordinate resolution.

The coordinate resolution of a forward calorimeter can be estimated with the help of the calorimeter design of the version 2. It is customary to use some methods for this purpose [9]. They all base on the definition of the coordinate as

\[<x>=\frac{\sum x_{i}*A_{i}}{\sum A_{i}}, \tag{3}\]

where \(A_{i}\)- the measured amplitude in the cell \(i\), \(x_{i}\)- its coordinate. For a hadron shower this estimation is quite sufficient. However for electromagnetic showers this definition contains the systematic error, determined by the larger cell size compared with the transverse size of an electromagnetic shower.

For the calorimeter version the dependence of the coordinates defined by the expression (3) on the true coordinates are presented in the fig.8 for the incoming particle energy E= 25 GeV. As it follows from the figure there is practically the linear relation between calculated and true coordinates for hadrons. For electromagnetic showers this dependence has a very complicated structure, which can be explained by the hexagonal shape of a cell.

The methods of the coordinate estimations, using as a parameter the ratio of amplitudes in adjacent cells, is not applicable here because of the hexagonal cell shape. Consequently we use here the method of the approximation the deviation between the calculated and true coordinates by different functions. The parameters of the functions are determined through the minimization procedure of the functional

\[FF=\sum_{i}^{{}^{\prime}retnt}(x_{i}-f(<x_{i}>,.4))^{2}, \tag{4}\]

where \(x_{i}\)- true coordinate of the particle entry point into a calorimeter, f-a function, depending on the variable \(<x_{i}>\) and parameters A. The more promising results on the reconstruction of X and Y coordinates have been obtained using the following functions (\(X_{cor}\)- reconstructed coordinate)

\[x_{corr}=x_{cell}+b*arsh\biggl{(}-\frac{<x>-.r_{cell}}{\Delta}sh(\frac{\Delta}{ b})\biggr{)}. \tag{5}\]

\[x_{cor}=<x>+a*R+b*R^{3}+c*R^{5}+d*R^{7}. \tag{6}\]

\[R=\frac{<x>-x_{cell}}{\Delta}.\]

Here \(\Delta\)- the half of the cell size, \(x_{cell}\)- the coordinate of a cell, \(sl\)- the hyperbolic function. For example, it was obtained that the standard deviation of \(x_{cor}\) from the true coordinate is \(\sigma\)= 1.1 cm instead of the initial one \(\sigma\)= 2.0 cm at the energy of electrons E= 25 GeV, b-parameter equals 0.92 cm. For pions at the same energy the corrected deviation coincides with the initial one and equals \(\sigma\)= 2.3 cm.

It is necessary to mention that owing to the long length of hadron showers and the presence of initial slope angle the reconstructed coordinates of particles are shifted from true ones. For example, even for the calorimeter radius R= 30 cm (the slope angle \(\theta=1.2^{0}\)) with the increasing energy of incoming hadrons from 2 GeV to 25 GeV the overestimation of reconstructed radius enlarges from 0.6 cm to 1.7 cm. To diminish the systematic shift it is convenient to proceed to the polar coordinates R and \(\phi\). The more prominent coordinate reconstruction here is achieved by the following functions

\[\phi_{corr}=<\phi>+a*arctg\biggl{(}\frac{\phi_{cell}-<\phi>}{c}\biggr{)}. \tag{7}\]

\[R_{corr}=<R>+a*\sin\biggl{(}\frac{R_{cell}-<R>}{c}\biggr{)}*\exp\biggl{(}-\frac {|R_{cell}-<R>|}{d}\biggr{)} \tag{8}\]

where coordinate \(<\phi>\) and \(<R>\) are determined with the expression (3). For hadron shower, taking into account the position of the maximum energy release and the distance of the calorimeter from the interaction point L, the radius is corrected as follows

\[<R>=\frac{\sum{(w_{i}*R_{i})*A_{i}}}{\sum{A_{i}}}.\]

\[w_{i}=1.0-\lambda*(0.7+0.2*ln(E))/L.\]As a result the reconstructed radius for hadron is not shifted from the true one.

The parameters of these functions depend on the energy of particles. The energy dependence of the finally corrected coordinate standard deviation can be described as follows

\[\sigma_{\phi,R}=\frac{A}{\sqrt{E}}+B. \tag{9}\]

where the estimations of parameters A and B are presented in the table 6. In the case of a calorimeter with the iron absorber the reconstructed value R has to be corrected also for electromagnetic showers because of its large lengths in iron.

It is necessary to mention that all these estimations were done for a single particle. In our case, when the forward calorimeter measures the jet energy with a large number of particles, we can use the expression (3) only. The accuracy of a jet coordinate resolution depends on the number of included cells and number of particles in jet. That is there is a full analogy with coordinate resolution for hadrons and the final coordinate resolution for jets cannot be worse than for hadrons in the case of good coordinate resolution for electrons.

## 4 Discussions.

The cell size \(\approx 10*10cm^{2}\) corresponds to the values \(\Delta\eta*\Delta\phi\approx 0.1*0.1\) and \(\approx 0.5*0.5\) depending on the calorimeter radius R. To check the contribution of each cell into the measured \(P_{T}\) distribution we simulated MINBIAS and 2-jet events on the PYTHIA program[10]. To reproduce the experimental data on multiparticle distribution[11] the simulation was done with switch on multiple interactions.

In the fig.9 one can see the number of particles and mean \(P_{T}\) value in the calorimeter cells depending on the calorimeter radius R for 10 MINBIAS events. One can see the large difference in the contamination of cells. For 10 MINBIAS events the energy value deposited in the forward calorimeter in the range \(3<\eta<6\) equals 5.0 TeV and in the range \(3<\eta<5\) it is 2.2 TeV.

The same distributions are given for 2-jet events for particles from jets. 2-jets events were simulated using \(P_{T}\)-cut 40 GeV. There were chosen jets with \(P_{T}(j\epsilon t)>20GeV\) with the jet radius in the field of \(\phi,\eta\) variables R=0.5.

From the figure it is evident that MINBIAS distributions more steeper than 2-jets ones. Taking into the account the presence of the underground particles in jets one can suppose that the distribution of jets particles over the forward calorimeter is approximately uniform. It means that the constant cell size in the calorimeter is adequate for jet detection.

The impact of the chosen cell size one can see in the fig.10, where \(P_{T}\)-distribution and detected \(\Delta P_{T}\) difference are given for MINBIAS jets with the jet energy E= 400 GeV and for 2-jets with the jet energy E= 250 GeV. The MINBIAS jets are defined as the flow of particles, where entry points of particles lay in the calorimeter radius range \(25<R<120(cm)\) (with the aim to diminish the energy leakage). The same restriction we used for 2-jets events. When we use the calorimeter with the small cell size 4.3*4.3 \(cm^{2}\) we obtain the improvement in the \(\phi-\) resolution about 15% and in the R-resolution about 5%. As the result the \(P_{T}-\) resolution compared with that given in the fig.10 does not change practically. Therefore the \(P_{T}-\) resolution in our case is entirely determined by the energy resolution of the calorimeter.

In the fig.11 one can see the particle energy distributions for MINBIAS and 2-jets events in the forward calorimeter (\(3<\eta<5\)). As it follows from this figure the mean particle energy is much less than 100 GeV. It means that the stochastic term in the energy resolution can be more important for the jet energy measurement than the constant term if the last is sufficiently small (see below). For example, in the case of jet with the energy value E= 250 GeV the mean particle energy is 26 GeV. Therefore the energy of \(\gamma-\)quanta in average less than 10 GeV. For this energy range the great part of the primary energy is absorbed in passive layers before the first active layer. That is why the \(P_{T}-\) resolution of the calorimeter does not depend practically on the cell size. From this point of view more preferable are those calorimeters which have iron absorber.

According to the simulated and experimental data the energy resolution of jets owing to a rather large fraction of e.m. energy may be considerably better than the single-pion one[12]. In this case the obtained energy resolution of a forward calorimeter for a single hadron can be considered as an upper value for the jet energy resolution. In the first order of the approximation the jet energy resolution can be evaluated through the single particle resolution. For example, in average the number of \(\gamma-\)quanta equals the number of hadrons in a jet. Therefore the average energy of \(\gamma-\)quanta equals \(E_{\gamma}=1/3*E*(1/N)\), where E- the energy of the jet and N- number of \(\gamma-\)quanta or hadrons. The average energy of one hadron is \(E_{h}=2/3*E*(1/N)\). Taking into the account the expression (1) the jet energy resolution can be expressed as follows:

\[\frac{\sigma_{{}_{j}}}{E}=\sqrt{\frac{(2/3)A_{\pi}^{2}E+(1/3)A_{e}^{2}E+(4/9)(C_ {\pi}^{2}E^{2}/N+1/9C_{e}^{2}E^{2}/N}{E}}.\]

In the first order of the approximation one can believe that the number of particles in jets can be expressed as follows

\[\frac{3}{2}N=\frac{E}{k}.\]

As the result we obtain that the jet energy resolution has not the constant term and the stochastic term of a jet is evaluated as the follows

\[A_{j}\approx\sqrt{(2/3)A_{\pi}^{2}+(1/3)A_{e}^{2}+(3/2)k(4/9)C_{\pi}^{2}}.\]

With the crude estimation the k-factor is about 10-20. From this expression it follows that the hadron constant term gives the large part of the jet energy resolution. To check this conclusion there were simulated the MINIBIAS jets with different jet-energies. The energy resolution of these jets was determined both for the calorimeter with layered structure of cells (version 2) with iron absorber plates (2 cm) and for the hybrid calorimeter with iron absorber plates (2 cm) and with 91 tubes in each cell. Besides there is the iron constructive layer with the thickness 3 cm before these calorimeters. The thickness of iron cell walls is 2 mm. The energy resolution data for jets and a single pion are presented in the fig. 12. One can see, that the jet energy resolution is much better than the same for a single pion, but the stochastic term for jets is greater than for a single pion owing to the large value of the constant term C. The jet energy resolution can be expressed in the following form:

for the sampling calorimeter

\[\left(\frac{\sigma}{A}\right)_{{}_{jet}t}=\frac{(90\pm 10)\%}{\sqrt{E}} \leftrightarrow(3\pm 2)\%,\]

and for the hybrid one \[\left(\frac{\sigma}{A}\right)_{jrt}=\frac{(96\pm 15)\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus(3\pm 2) \%.\]

For a single pion the data can be taken from the tables 4 and 5. It is necessary to mention that this energy resolution was obtained for the case when there are 3 calorimeter longitudinal sections (1\(\lambda\), 1.5\(\lambda\) and the rest) for the version 2 and 2 longitudinal sections for the hybrid version. In the case without any longitudinal division the stochastic term is enlarge by \(\thickapprox 10\%\) for the sampling calorimeter and by \(\thickapprox 5\%\) for the hybrid calorimeter. The constant term is of the same value.

The coordinate jet resolution in the \(\phi\) and R variables can be expressed for the version 2 in the form:

\[\sigma_{\phi}=\frac{(1.10\pm 0.30)}{\sqrt{E}}+(0.04\pm 0.02)(rad).\]

\[\sigma_{R}=\frac{(15.1\pm 1.5)}{\sqrt{E}}+(0.4\pm 0.1)(cm).\]

The average deviation value from zero for the R-resolution is about 2 cm.

The coordinate jet resolution in the X,Y variables can be expressed in the form:

\[\sigma_{X,Y}=\frac{(25.0\pm 3.0)}{\sqrt{E}}+(0.6\pm 0.2)(cm).\]

The average deviation value from zero is about 1 cm. Approximately the same values have been obtained for the hybrid version. If we compare these coordinate resolution with that from the table 6, then one can make the conclusion that the coordinate resolution for a single pion is better than jets one because of the bad electromagnetic coordinate resolution.

Taking into the account all these data one can make the conclusion that practically all calorimeter variants of versions 2 and 3 meet the ATLAS requirements[1].

In conclusion we would like to thank F. Carminati, A. Dell'Acqua and S. Giani for their help in solving some problems in programs, connected with the GEANT code.

## Appendix.

The simulated data obtained with the help of the program GEANT3.15 have been compared with the experimental ones with the aim to fix the parameters values for the program. There where used experimental data from the electromagnetic gas ionization prototype with the energy of beam electrons E= 25 GeV. The calorimeter is a tube with the radius R= 5 cm filled with lead absorber plates with the thickness 0.55 cm. The thickness of the gas gap between absorber plates is 0.24 cm. The length of the prototype equals 30 cm. The gas mixture (\(90\%Ar+10\%CF_{4}\)) were pumped into the prototype under the pressure P= 30 atm. There were used two sets of parameters values for the program GEANT3.15. They are presented in the fig.1. For the first set of the parameters the simulated energy resolution equals (\(4.6\pm 1.3\))%, for the second one - (\(3.9\pm 1.0\))% (fig.1b). The experimental energy resolution equals 4.0%. Hence, both sets of parameters values give contented description of the experiment although the second parameters set gives much more time consuming process compared with the first one.

Another experimental results were presented for hadron calorimeter which has the following characteristics (L3 experiment[13]). The thickness of uranium absorber plates is 4.5 mm with gaps 6 mm. The total length of the calorimeter is 5 interaction lengths. Proportional chambers are filled with the gas mixture (\(80\%Ar+20\%CO_{2}\)) under the pressure 1 atm. The energy of incoming particles is 6 GeV. The next experimental data have been taken for high pressure gas ionization sampling calorimeter [4]. Uranium absorber plates in the first part of the calorimeter were covered by the aluminium clads. The thickness of uranium plates is 6.5 mm and for aluminium ones 1.5 mm and 3.5 mm. In the second part of calorimeter there were iron absorber plates. The total length of the hadron calorimeter is about 6 \(\lambda\). Gas mixture (\(95\%Ar+5\%CF4\)) files the gas ionization chambers under the pressure P= 30 atm. The energy of particles was E= 20 GeV. The comparison of experimental data and simulated ones is presented in the table 1 for different parameters of the GEANT315 program. From the table it is follows that FLUKA (HADR=4) does not describe the energy resolution for hadrons in the gas calorimeter.

Therefore for the simulation in the article will be used the first set of parameters values (fig.1a).

Table 5: Version 3. The dependence of the energy resolution parameters A and C from expression (1) on the calorimeter radius R, the distance between tubes and absorber type in the first part of cells. The last column of the table presents the average hadron energy leakage with the dispersion of the energy leakage distribution at the energy E= 100 GeV. The width of iron cell walls is 2 mm. The line marked with the word ’Rod’ presents results for the structure, where enstead of usual tubes we use tubes with iron rods inside (see text). The line marked with one asterisk presents results for the structure, where the absorber plates consist of lead and aluminium material (see text). The line marked with two asterisks has the same meaning as previous one but with aluminium tubes instead of iron one.
