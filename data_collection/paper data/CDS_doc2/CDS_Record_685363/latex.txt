**Abstract**

Hadron and electron tracks selected from events fully simulated and reconstructed using DICE and level-2 \(B\)-physics trigger algorithms were used to obtain parameterisations for track smearing and reconstruction efficiencies in the Inner Detector. To test the performance of the parameterisations, they were implemented in the FORTRAN fast-simulation package ATLFAST, and the obtained results were compared with the corresponding full-simulation results.

Introduction

In this note, parameterisations for hadron and electron tracks reconstructed in the ATLAS Inner Detector (ID) for the level-2 (LVL2) \(B\)-physics trigger are presented. The procedure to obtain the parameterisations followed closely the one described in Ref. [1] for hadrons reconstructed in the offline environment. The testing of their performances with respect to full simulation was also done in a similar way.

The hadron and electron tracks were reconstructed through dedicated algorithms in the Pixel Detector and in the SCT. No extrapolation was done into the TRT, therefore no electron identification is included. The "ATLAS Physics TDR" [2] geometry for the ID was used.

These parameterisations can be used in a fast simulation of the ATLAS trigger, which aims to produce similar results as the full trigger simulation by taking as input generator-level events.

This note is organised as follows: Section 2 summarises the data samples and software tools used in this study. Section 3 describes the characteristic features of the parameterisations for hadron and electron tracks, and how these parameterisations were obtained. Section 4 gives details about how the new parameterisations were implemented in ATLFAST[3] in order to test them and compare their performance with the one from full simulation; results of these tests and checks are presented in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 shortly summarises the results and gives an outlook to future work.

## 2 Data Samples,

Simulation and Reconstruction Software

The hadron and electron tracks used in this work were selected from n-tuples which had been produced via the following procedure. Events were generated at particle level with the PYTHIA-based atgen[4, 5, 6]. The ATLAS detector response was then simulated with DICE 98_2[6] using the ID only. Pile-up from minimum-bias events [5] (2.3 events on average in the ID for low luminosity, _i.e._, \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) was superimposed at DICE level. The simulated events were then passed on to dedicated trigger software: ASCII dump files produced by ATRIG[7] were subsequently used as input for the stand-alone LVL2 \(B\)-physics trigger reconstruction package CTrig[8]. CTrig produces n-tuples containing information about the reconstructed tracks.

Details about the reconstructed tracks are summarised in Table 1 for hadrons and in Table 2 for electrons.

Approximately 200k hadron (_i.e._, kaon and pion) tracks were selected from signal events of types \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}(\phi\pi^{-})\,\pi^{+}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}(\phi\pi^{-})\,a_{1}^{+}\), and from background events of type \(b\bar{b}\to\mu 6\,X\).

The n-tuples containing these tracks were already studies for the "ATLAS High-Level Triggers, DAQ and DCS: Technical Proposal" [9] and its accompanying back-up note [10]. The track-reconstruction algorithms were the same in the different CTrig versions used to produce the n-tuples. Track seeds are first obtained in the Pixel Detector using the PixTrig algorithm [11], and the tracks are then extrapolated into the SCT. The label p418d means Pixel-guided SiKalman algorithm with muon guidance, where track seeds from the Pixels pass a \(p_{T}\) cut of \(p_{T}>1.0\) GeV and are selected in a window \(\Delta z<0.4\) cm around the muon vertex \(z\) position.

Electron tracks were selected mainly from \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi(e^{+}e^{-})\,K^{0}\) and \(b\bar{b}\to\mu 6\,X\) events. 2000 events were available from previous studies; about 5000 events with superimposed pile-up were simulated in addition from already existing DICE files. The CTrig reconstruction algorithm used was Pixel-guided SiKalman with muon guidance, where track seeds from the Pixels pass a \(p_{T}\) cut of \(p_{T}>0.5\) GeV and are selected in a window \(\Delta z<1.0\) cm around the muon vertex \(z\) position (abbreviated by p420c). About 15k reconstructed electron tracks were selected from all generated n-tuples.

Details of the Parameterisations

The procedure for determining the hadron and electron track parameterisations follows closely the one applied for hadron tracks from offline described in detail in Ref. [1].

The offline parameterisation was done in terms of three variables: the transverse distance of the track's production vertex \(\boldsymbol{v}\) to the primary vertex, \(r_{T}:=\sqrt{v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{\,2}}\); the modulus of the track's pseudo-rapidity, \(|\eta|\); and the track's transverse momentum, \(p_{T}\). For the LVL2 \(B\)-physics trigger, the parameterisation is done in terms of two variables only: \(|\eta|\) and \(p_{T}\). The variable \(r_{T}\) was not needed, because PixTrig requires three space points in the Pixel Detector, one in each of the three Pixel layers; hence all reconstructed tracks start at the first (\(B\)) layer, whose transverse radius is \(r_{T}=4.0\) cm.

#### Pre-Selection of Tracks, Binning

The acceptance interval in \(|\eta|\) for both hadron and electron tracks was \(|\eta|\in[0.0,2.5)\). For hadrons, this interval was divided into five equidistant bins; for electron tracks into two equidistant bins, due to the smaller statistics.

The true transverse momentum was required to be \(p_{T}>1.0\) GeV for hadron tracks and \(p_{T}>0.5\) GeV for electron tracks. Similar to the procedure described in Ref. [1], the binning in \(p_{T}\) was chosen to be variable: boundaries and the \(p_{T}\) expectation value in a given \(p_{T}\) bin were calculated using the fitted functional shape of the tracks' true \(p_{T}\) spectrum.

#### Determination of Quantities Related with Track Helix Parameters

Tracks contained in a given \((|\eta|,p_{T})\) cell were selected from the available n-tuples. For these tracks, the residual distribution of each of the five track helix parameters \(d_{0}\), \(z_{0}\), \(\phi_{0}\), \(\cot\theta_{0}\), \(q/p_{T}\) was fitted with the sum of two Gaussian functions, and the correlation coefficient \(\rho\) was calculated for each pair of track-parameter residuals.

In the case of hadron tracks, the distributions for all helix-parameter residuals are symmetrical around zero, thus apart from a normalisation factor three parameters are sufficient to define each fit function: the Gaussian core resolution, the Gaussian tail resolution, and the core fraction. For electron tracks, bremsstrahlung gives a small asymmetry of the \(d_{0}\) residual distribution, see Fig. 4. The asymmetry could be modelled by taking the mean values of the core and tail Gaussians as free fit parameters. No significant deviation from symmetry within the available statistics could be observed in the distributions of the residuals of the other four track parameters. Hence the quantities extracted from the fits for electron tracks were: the Gaussian core and tail resolutions, core fraction for all five helix parameters \(d_{0}\), \(z_{0}\), \(\phi_{0}\), \(\cot\theta_{0}\), \(q/p_{T}\); the mean values of the Gaussian core and tails for \(d_{0}\).

### Determination of Track-Reconstruction Efficiencies

The reconstructed tracks contained in the CTrig n-tuples come from three different sources: primary tracks from signal events, primary tracks from superimposed pile-up events, and secondary tracks resulting from interaction of primary tracks with the detector material.

The CTrig track-reconstruction algorithms have been designed and tuned to be efficient for primary tracks from signal events. The efficiencies for secondary tracks and pile-up tracks are lower, because their average \(p_{T}\) is lower in general; in addition, pile-up tracks originate from events with shifted primary vertex.

The hadron reconstruction efficiencies were calculated in each \((|\eta|,p_{T})\) cell separately for each of the three track categories. For electron tracks, the reconstruction efficiency was calculated in each \((|\eta|,p_{T})\) cell only for electrons from \(J/\psi\) decays. The statistics of pile-up and secondary electrons was too low to obtain a parameterisation.

### Parameterisation of the Extracted Quantities

Similar to the offline parameterisation, the aim was to achieve a parameterisation independent of the binning in \(p_{T}\) and to find a functional \(p_{T}\)-dependence of all the extracted quantities.

For a given \(|\eta|\) bin, the \(p_{T}\)-dependence of the \(d_{0}\), \(z_{0}\), \(\phi_{0}\), \(\cot\theta_{0}\), \(q/p_{T}\) Gaussian core and tail resolutions, core fractions, the \(d_{0}\) mean values of Gaussian core and tails (electrons only), and the correlation coefficient \(\rho\) for each track-parameter pair was fitted with a function of the type

\[f(p_{T})=C_{\infty}+\frac{C_{1}}{p_{T}}+\frac{C_{2}}{\sqrt{p_{T}}}+\frac{C_{3 }}{p_{T}^{2}} \tag{1}\]

where \(C_{\infty}\), \(C_{1}\), \(C_{2}\), \(C_{3}\) are \(|\eta|\)-dependent coefficients. The \(p_{T}\)-dependence of most quantities was reproduced by Eq. (1) with \(C_{2}=C_{3}=0\). For hadron tracks, \(C_{2}\neq 0\), \(C_{3}=0\) were used in the fits of the core and tail resolutions, and \(C_{2}=0\), \(C_{3}\neq 0\) in the fits of the correlation coefficients. See Fig. 1 as an example.

Significant correlations were observed for both hadron and electron tracks only between the four track-parameter pairs \((d_{0},\phi_{0})\), \((d_{0},q/p_{T})\), \((\phi_{0},q/p_{T})\), \((z_{0},\cot\theta_{0})\). The correlation

coefficients between the remaining six track-parameter pairs were found to be compatible with zero.

The \(p_{T}\)-dependences of the track-reconstruction efficiencies for each \(|\eta|\) bin were described by functions of the type

\[\mbox{\it Eff}_{\rm had}(p_{T})=E_{\infty}\;\frac{E_{1}+p_{T}^{2}}{E_{2}+p_{T}^{ 2}} \tag{2}\]

for hadron tracks and

\[\mbox{\it Eff}_{\rm el}(p_{T})=E_{\infty}\;\frac{E_{1}+p_{T}}{E_{2}+p_{T}} \tag{3}\]

for electron tracks, where \(E_{\infty}\), \(E_{1}\), \(E_{2}\) are \(|\eta|\)-dependent coefficients. For hadron tracks from pile-up, \(E_{1}=E_{2}=0\) was a reasonable choice. The reconstruction efficiency for secondary tracks was found to be negligible. As an example, Fig. 2 illustrates the \(p_{T}\)-dependence of the hadron reconstruction efficiencies for signal and pile-up events.

Although CTrig track reconstruction through Pixel-guided SiKalman makes use of the \(z\) position of the tracks' vertices relative to the trigger-muon vertex in order to reduce combinatorics and reject tracks from pile-up, introducing \(\Delta z\) as an additional parameter was not necessary. This might not be the case for high luminosity, where there are more pile-up tracks per event.

To summarise, the following sets of coefficients were determined for each \(|\eta|\) interval:

* \(\{C_{\infty},C_{1},C_{2},C_{3}\}\), parameterising the \(p_{T}\)-dependence according to Eq. (1) of the Gaussian core resolutions, Gaussian tail resolutions, core fractions of the helix parameters \(d_{0}\), \(z_{0}\), \(\phi_{0}\), \(\cot\theta_{0}\), \(q/p_{T}\), and of the correlation coefficients \(\rho(d_{0},\phi_{0})\), \(\rho(d_{0},q/p_{T})\), \(\rho(\phi_{0},q/p_{T})\), \(\rho(z_{0},\cot\theta_{0})\); for electrons only, also of the mean values of the Gaussian core and tail resolutions for \(d_{0}\);
* \(\{E_{\infty},E_{1},E_{2}\}\), parameterising the \(p_{T}\)-dependence of the reconstruction efficiencies, according to Eq. (2) for hadron tracks from signal and pile-up events, and according to Eq. (3) for primary electron tracks from signal events.

The values of the coefficients were assembled in dedicated data files.

Implementation in Atlfast

The obtained LVL2 parameterisations were implemented in ATLFAST similarly to the offline parameterisation; see details in Ref. [1].

In the case of hadron tracks, the file containing the data necessary for the smearing of the five track helix parameters was assembled in the same format as the corresponding one from offline. Hence, the track smearing for the LVL2 \(B\)-physics trigger was obtained by simply replacing the offline parameter file with the new one for LVL2.

The default electron smearing procedure implemented in ATLFAST is organised qualitatively differently from the one applied to hadron tracks. Therefore, in order to have electron smearing similar to hadrons, a new smearing routine had to be written. The new routine has the same interface as the default one, but performs the smearing similarly to hadron smearing.

The default reconstruction efficiency assigned to a track in ATLFAST was overwritten with the appropriate one for LVL2 in the user-defined ATLFAST routine MAKUSE.

## 5 Comparison between Fast and Full Simulations

In order to test the agreement between full (DICE/ATRIG/CTrig) and fast (ATLFAST) simulations, two types of checks were performed. First, the shapes of the residual distributions for the track parameters, the values of the total reconstruction efficiencies, and the values of the correlation coefficients, as obtained with full and fast simulations, were compared. Second, an ATLFAST analysis analogous to the full-simulation analysis from Refs. [9, 10] was performed to determine the LVL2 \(B\)-physics trigger rate for the hadronic channel \(D_{s}\to\phi(K^{+}K^{-})\pi\).

#### Agreement of Track-Parameter Residual Distributions, Correlation Coefficients

Tests of the first type were based on sets of tracks common in full and fast simulations. For hadrons, the track sample consisted of \(\sim\)68k kaon and pion tracks from \(B^{0}_{s}\to D_{s}\,\pi\) events. For electrons, \(\sim\)13k tracks from \(J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}\) decays were selected from \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi\,K^{0}\) events. Primary tracks from signal events (_i.e._, excluding pile-up tracks), within the corresponding \(|\eta|\) and \(p_{T}\) acceptances, were read from the KINE block of the CTrig n-tuples. The same sets of hadron and electron tracks were then identified at particle level and subsequently used as input for the fast-simulation analysis.

For tracks reconstructed by CTrig, the distributions of \(d_{0}\), \(z_{0}\), \(\phi_{0}\), \(\cot\theta_{0}\), \(q/p_{T}\) helix-parameter residuals were obtained. Using ATLFAST, the sets of particle-level tracks were smeared and corrected for reconstruction efficiencies, according to the parameterisations described in Section 3. The resulting distributions of the helix-parameter residuals are shown in Fig. 3 (hadrons) and Fig. 4 (electrons) for full and fast simulations.

Figure 3: The \(d_{0}\), \(z_{0}\), \(\phi_{0}\), \(\cot\theta_{0}\), \(q/p_{T}\) track-parameter residuals for hadron tracks, obtained with full (DICE/ATRIG/CTrig; error bars) and fast (ATLFAST; filled histograms) simulations.

Figure 4: The \(d_{0}\), \(z_{0}\), \(\phi_{0}\), \(\cot\theta_{0}\), \(q/p_{T}\) track-parameter residuals for electron tracks, obtained with full (DICE/ATRIG/CTrig; error bars) and fast (ATLFAST; filled histograms) simulations. Note the asymmetry in the \(d_{0}\) residual distribution.

A bin-by-bin comparison of the individual histograms obtained from full and fast simulations was performed, and the quantity \(\chi^{2}\), defined as

\[\chi^{2}\;:=\;\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\rm bin}}\left(\frac{\mathcal{N}_{i}^{\rm full}- \mathcal{N}_{i}^{\rm fast}}{\sigma_{i}}\right)^{2}\qquad\mbox{where}\quad\sigma _{i}\;:=\;\sqrt{\mathcal{N}_{i}^{\rm full}+\mathcal{N}_{i}^{\rm fast}}\]

was calculated: \(N_{\rm bin}\) denotes the number of non-empty histogram bins, \(\mathcal{N}_{i}^{\rm full}\) and \(\mathcal{N}_{i}^{\rm fast}\) are the numbers of entries in bin \(i\) from full and fast simulation, respectively. The error on the bin entries was assumed to be Poissonian. The bin-by-bin comparison checks the combined performance of track smearing and reconstruction efficiency.

Table 3 summarises the values obtained for \(\chi^{2}/n_{\rm dof}\), where \(n_{\rm dof}\equiv N_{\rm bin}\). The agreement between full and fast simulations is reasonable. Tails in the \(d_{0}\) residual distribution for hadrons are however underestimated, and a general tendency to overestimate the cores in the electron distributions is seen. The asymmetry in the \(d_{0}\) residual distribution is correctly reproduced, see Figs. 3 and 4

The total (integrated) reconstruction efficiencies for primary tracks from signal events, given in Table 4, are also in agreement between full and fast simulations.

The correlation coefficients \(\rho\) of the four pairs \((d_{0},\phi_{0})\), \((d_{0},q/p_{T})\)\((\phi_{0},q/p_{T})\), \((z_{0},\cot\theta_{0})\) of track-parameter residuals were also calculated for the same samples of reconstructed tracks. The results are summarised in Table 5. Again, reasonable agreement between the full and fast simulations is obtained.

### Determination of the \(D_{s}\) LVL2 \(B\)-Physics Trigger Rate

In the second type of tests, an analysis chain similar to the one used in full simulation was set up in ATLFAST.

The fully simulated data consist of signal events with on average 2.3 minimum-bias pile-up events superimposed, whereas the associated particle-level atgen files contain signal events only; therefore pile-up had to be added at particle level. For low luminosity, pile-up does not affect the \(B\)-physics trigger performance significantly; it can however be important for high-luminosity studies.

Using the GNZPILE routine from GENZ[6], on average 2.3 minimum-bias particle-level events were superimposed on each of the 5000 \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}(\phi\pi^{-})\,\pi^{+}\) and 8000 \(b\bar{b}\to\mu 6\,X\) events. The spatial positions of the primary vertices in pile-up events were smeared according to the resolutions \(\sigma_{x}=\sigma_{y}=15\)\(\mu\)m, \(\sigma_{z}=5.6\) cm [2], giving an event'start time' resolution of \(\sigma_{t}=0.187\) ps. Since the Silicon Tracker is fast, the added pile-up events are from the same bunch-crossing.

These samples were used as input data for the ATLFAST analysis. All the hadron tracks were smeared according to the parameterised resolutions and correlations as described in Sections 3 and 4, and the appropriate reconstruction efficiencies, depending on whether the tracks came from the signal or pile-up stream, were applied.

The event reconstruction was performed as in full simulation. It consists of three steps: track pre-selection, \(\phi\) reconstruction, \(D_{s}\) reconstruction. The analysis was run on the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}(\phi\pi^{-})\,\pi^{+}\) sample to determine the \(\phi\) and \(D_{s}\) mass resolutions. These mass resolutions defined the size of the mass windows in which \(\phi\) and \(D_{s}\) candidates were selected in \(b\bar{b}\to\mu 6\,X\) events. Using the percentage of events selected in the \(b\bar{b}\to\mu 6\,X\) sample and a LVL2 input rate of 9 kHz, the \(D_{s}\) trigger rate was computed for fast and full simulations. The results are presented in Table 6. Reasonable agreement between full and fast simulations could be achieved.

## 6 Summary and Outlook

In this note, it was shown that the output and performance of LVL2 \(B\)-physics track-reconstruction algorithms for fully simulated hadrons and electrons in the Silicon Tracker of the ID can be satisfactorily parameterised.

The results will be implemented in a fast simulation of the ATLAS trigger. Future work will also include updating the parameterisations to the latest ID layout, looking at the electron identification using the TRT, and porting the analysis to the ATHENA environment.
