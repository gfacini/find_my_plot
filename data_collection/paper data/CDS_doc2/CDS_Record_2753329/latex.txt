## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS muon spectrometer (MS) consists of three large air-core superconducting toroidal magnets (two end-caps and one barrel) providing a field of approximately \(0.5\,\mathrm{T}\). The deflection of the muon trajectories in the bending plane of the magnetic field is measured via hits in three stations of monitored drift tube (MDT) precision chambers covering the region in pseudorapidity1 up to \(|\eta|<2.7\). In the innermost end-cap wheels of the MS, cathode strip chambers (CSC) are used instead of MDTs in the region \(2.0<|\eta|<2.7\).

Footnote 1: The global ATLAS coordinate system is right-handed and has its origin in the nominal interaction point, with the \(X\) axis pointing toward the centre of the LHC, \(Y\) pointing upward, and \(Z\) along the beam line. The polar angle, \(\theta\), is defined with respect to the positive \(Z\) axis, and the azimuthal angle, \(\phi\), with respect to the positive \(X\) axis. The pseudorapidity, \(\eta\), is defined as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\). The radius, \(R\), is defined as \(R=\sqrt{X^{2}+Y^{2}}\).

The precision chambers are arranged such that their plane of measurement is roughly aligned with the bending plane of the magnet system (approximately along \(R\)-\(Z\)). The coordinate perpendicular to the muon trajectory in the measurement plane is referred to as the "precision coordinate" (approximately along \(\theta\) or \(\eta\)), while the "second coordinate" is orthogonal to the measurement plane (approximately along \(\phi\)).

The magnetic field strength is such that the sagitta of a track, i.e. the maximum deviation of the curved track from a straight line joining its endpoints in the spectrometer, is on average \(500\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) for a transverse momentum of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=1\,\mathrm{TeV}\). An optical alignment system [1] monitors in real time the positions of precision chambers with respect to each other and to calibrated reference objects in the detector. The system also measures chamber deformations and thermal expansion. The stand-alone momentum resolution of the spectrometer, as expected from design, is better than \(\Delta p_{\mathrm{T}}/p_{\mathrm{T}}=4\%\) over a large range in momentum, increasing to around \(10\%\) for a track of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=1\,\mathrm{TeV}\), with substantial variations across the acceptance caused by the variety of the detector layout and by the heterogeneity of the magnetic field. It is dominated at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) by energy loss in the calorimeters, at intermediate \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) by multiple scattering in material inside the spectrometer, and at high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) by the design alignment accuracy of \(30\)-\(40\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) and the precision chamber single-hit resolution of \(80\)-\(90\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\).

Three stations of resistive plate chambers (RPC) in the barrel (\(|\eta|<1.05\)) and three or four stations of thin gap chambers (TGC) in the end-caps (\(1.05<|\eta|<2.4\)) provide the muon trigger, and also measure the second coordinate.

The inner, middle, and outer stations of the barrel and end-cap chambers are labelled BI, BM, BO and EI, EM, EO, respectively, and muons are normally detected in those three "standard" stations. In the barrel-end-cap transition region (\(1.05<|\eta|<1.3\)) muons are detected instead in the EIL4 or BIS7/8, EE(extra), and EM stations. In a small region around \(|\eta|=1.6\) where the magnetic field reverses sign, the BEE chambers provide a fourth measurement station. The MS is sub-divided azimuthally (along \(\phi\)) into 16 sectors, eight large (L) and eight small (S), covering \(28^{\circ}\) and \(17^{\circ}\), respectively. Large sectors are located in between the eight barrel toroid coils, and small sectors overlap in \(\phi\) with the coils. Sectors are numbered starting from 1 at \(\phi=0\) (sector 1 is thus a large sector).

A particular feature of the reconstruction in the MS is the heterogeneity of the magnetic field, and the variety of the detector layout. This leads to strong variations of the bending power across the spectrometer acceptance. The bending power is defined here as the proportionality factor between the inverse of the muon transverse momentum and the sagitta, valid in the high-momentum regime. It can be derived directly from the map of the magnetic field and from the MS layout: this is shown in Fig. 1, and average values in several detector regions are presented in Table 1. As the bending power is heterogeneous across the detector acceptance, one may derive different target values for the alignment performance, depending on the detector region.

The optical alignment system and the reconstruction procedure are described in [2] for the barrel and [3] for the end-cap. The array of optical sensors consists of 5800 sensors for the barrel, and 6600 sensors for the two end-caps. In addition, temperature sensors are attached to each muon chamber. Most of the optical lines are either Rasniks [4] or BCAMs [3]. Both types of devices are 3-point straightness monitors: an illuminated target is imaged using a lens on a sensor (CCD or CMOS). The recorded image is used to measure the deviation from a straight line of the center points of the three elements (sensor, lens, target), indicative of the positions and deformations of the muon detectors or reference objects they are attached to. A thorough campaign of measurements and calibrations of the optical sensors and of the muon chambers was undertaken at the time of the construction of the MS to determine with high precision the positions of the optical elements with respect to the devices they are attached to. The alignment reconstruction programs make use of this information to build response models of every optical sensor, as a function of the positions and deformations of the muon chambers and reference objects (the "alignment constants"). These programs carry out \(\chi^{2}\) minimization by comparing the actual sensor measurements to these response models, and are thus able to reconstruct the alignment constants.

Using the optical system alone, it is however impossible to reconstruct the alignment of the MS with the precision required for the reconstruction of high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) muons: the overall calibration of the optical system falls short of this target [5]. The optical system data is thus combined with track information. In particular, special calibration ATLAS runs (cosmics and collisions) are recorded with the toroid magnets switched off. In these runs, the muon trajectories deviate from straight lines only by the effect of multiple scattering. A \(\chi^{2}\) is built from these track data, and combined with that of the optical system. The alignment constants resulting from the minimization are collectively called the "reference geometry". The optical system is then used to extrapolate this reference geometry to the time of the physics runs (in which the toroid magnets are on). The determination of this reference geometry is, effectively, a re-calibration of the optical system.

An updated MS alignment has been prepared for the 2017 and 2018 ATLAS data, and will be used in the reprocessing that is in preparation. This alignment update accounts for various events during the extended winter shutdown of 2016/17: the installation of new chambers (BMG) covering acceptance holes in the barrel feet sectors (12 and 14), the disassembly and repair of several CSC chambers, and an overall performance loss that is a consequence of damages to alignment sensors during the numerous detector accesses. For the purpose of determining this new alignment, several toroid-off runs have been recorded and used: a toroid-off cosmic run recorded in December 2017, and two toroid-off collision runs recorded in June 2017 and June 2018. For the barrel, the cosmic run and the 2018 toroid-off collision run are used to compute a single reference geometry, valid for the full 2017/18 period. For the end-cap, several CSC chambers were disassembled during the winter shutdown of 2017/18, leading to the necessity of computing two separate reference geometries, using each of the 2017/2018 toroid-off collision runs for the corresponding year.

This note presents the performance of the internal alignment of the MS in 2017 and 2018 data, using the updated alignment. Section 2 presents an analysis of the sagitta deviations observed in toroid-off collision runs, and Section 3 presents a validation of the alignment obtained in toroid-on collision runs using tracks in the overlap regions of neighbouring MS sectors.

## 2 Performance measurement with toroid-off collision runs

When the toroid magnets are switched off, the muon trajectories deviate from straight lines only by the effect of multiple scattering as they cross detector material. Averaging out the effect of multiple scattering,the sagitta may thus be used to quantify the performance of the MS internal alignment.

In this section, the sagitta \(s\) is defined for tracks measured by three precision chambers which have their strips or wires nearly parallel, i.e. three MDT or CSC chambers belonging to a single sector. Assuming three points of measurement, I, M and O, the sagitta is defined to be the signed distance between M and the line connecting I and O, projected in the sector measurement plane (see Fig. 2). A tower is defined as any triplet of chambers suitable for the measurement of the sagitta.

We present here an analysis of the per-tower sagitta deviations observed in the ATLAS collision run recorded in June 2017 without field in the toroids.

First, tracks are selected by requiring that they have precision coordinate hits in at least three stations of chambers, belonging to a single sector. In addition, at least one second-coordinate hit is required. The muon track is also required to be associated to an inner-detector (ID) track by the combined muon reconstruction [6]. As the solenoid field in kept on, the ID provides a measurement of the track transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{ID}}\). A loose momentum cut is applied at this point: \(10\,\mathrm{GeV}<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{ID}}<100\,\mathrm{GeV}\).

For a given track, it is sometimes possible to select several triplets of chambers suitable to define a tower (e.g. in the case of a track crossing the overlap of neighbouring chambers). Every such triplet is considered. Towers with insufficient acceptance (size in \(\eta\) smaller than 0.05) or towers not connected by the optical system (in the barrel/end-cap overlap) are discarded. For a given track and a given tower, a set of acceptance cuts is then applied: these cuts are needed either to reduce the selection bias on the sagitta near the edge of the acceptance (for the I and O chambers), or to provide well-defined bounds \(\{s^{\mathrm{min}},s^{\mathrm{max}}\}\) in the distribution of the sagitta (for the M chamber).

In order to make the best use of the available statistics of the toroid-off sample, the per-tower sagitta deviations are determined from a likelihood analysis, in which per-track resolutions are used. For each track, a sagitta resolution \(\sigma_{\mathrm{sag}}(s)\) is computed, dominated by the multiple scattering contribution which is estimated from the track momentum (measured in the ID) and from the known distribution of material in the MS volume (provided by the muon reconstruction program).

For a sample of \(N\) tracks selected in a given tower, with sagitta values \(\{s_{i}\}\), the tower sagitta deviations are determined by minimizing the following function:

\[-2\log\mathcal{L}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}-2\log f_{i}(s_{i}) \tag{1}\]

Figure 2: Definition of the sagitta from three measurements I, M and O of precision stations belonging to a single sector. The vector \(\mathbf{w}\) refers to the wire direction for the MDT detectors (for the CSC detectors, the precision strip direction plays this role). The plane orthogonal to \(\mathbf{w}\) is the measurement plane (it coincides approximately with the actual bending plane of the muon trajectory in the presence of magnetic field).

The probability density function \(f_{i}(s_{i})\) for track \(i\) is the distribution \(g_{C}(s_{i};\mu,\sigma,\rho)\) with proper normalization for the sagitta bounds \(\{s_{i}^{\text{min}},s_{i}^{\text{max}}\}\), where \(g_{C}\) is a compound distribution of a Gaussian with a flat distribution around the standard deviation in the range \([(1-\rho\sqrt{3})\sigma,(1+\rho\sqrt{3})\sigma]\). \(\rho\) effectively serves here as a shape parameter, and may be interpreted as the fractional resolution of the resolution. The \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) parameters differ for each track and are taken as:

\[\mu=\mu_{0}+\mu_{\theta}\frac{\theta_{i}-\langle\theta\rangle}{ \text{rms}(\theta)}+\mu_{\phi}\frac{\phi_{i}-\langle\phi\rangle}{\text{rms}( \phi)} \tag{2}\] \[\sigma=\text{SF}\times\sigma_{\text{sag}}(s_{i}) \tag{3}\]

Where:

* SF is a scale factor applied to the sagitta resolution, modelling a possible uncertainty of the overall amount of multiple scattering in the given tower;
* \(\langle\theta\rangle\), \(\text{rms}(\theta)\), \(\langle\phi\rangle\) and \(\text{rms}(\phi)\) are the mean and RMS of the first and second coordinates \(\theta_{i}\) and \(\phi_{i}\) of all the tracks in the tower acceptance;
* \(\mu_{0}\) is the mean sagitta deviation in the tower, \(\mu_{\theta}\) and \(\mu_{\phi}\) are sagitta deviation dependence parameters with first and second coordinates inside the tower.

While the parameter \(\mu_{0}\) models an overall sagitta deviation in the tower, the parameters \(\mu_{\theta}\) and \(\mu_{\phi}\) give access to sub-tower granularity, by modelling a linear variation with first and second coordinates. \(\mu_{0}\), \(\mu_{\theta}\) and \(\mu_{\phi}\) are all expressed in \(\upmu\)m. For each tower, the following free parameters are fitted: \(\mu_{0}\), \(\mu_{\theta}\), \(\mu_{\phi}\), SF and \(\rho\). Typical values found in the result of the fit are \(\rho\sim 30\%\) and \(\text{SF}\sim 1.3\) (barrel), \(1.5\) (end-cap).

The sagitta deviation parameters, \(\mu_{0}\), \(\mu_{\theta}\), \(\mu_{\phi}\), are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, for all the selected towers of the MS. Most of the values lie within a range of \(\pm 0.1\,\text{mm}\). Outliers are found mainly for \(\mu_{0}\) in a few barrel and end-cap sectors. The statistical sensitivity of this test is weaker in the barrel feet sectors (12 and 14) because of the large multiple scattering induced by the foot material.

As the number of towers selected in this analysis is quite large, it is desirable to summarize the distributions of \(\mu_{0}\), \(\mu_{\theta}\), \(\mu_{\phi}\) with some overall standard deviations. It would be incorrect to simply compute the RMS of these values because each tower measurement comes with a sizeable statistical error. Instead, we define overall alignment performance numbers \(\sigma_{\text{ali}}\) as the quantity to be added in quadrature to the statistical error of the per-tower sagitta deviations to make their scattering around zero compatible with the total error.

More precisely, for a sample of \(K\) towers with sagitta deviations \(\mu_{j}^{i}\) (\(j=0,\theta,\phi\) and \(i=1\) to \(K\)), \(\sigma_{\text{ali}}(\mu_{j})\) is determined by minimizing the following function, with \(g\) the normal (Gaussian) distribution:

\[\begin{split}-2\log\mathcal{L}&=\sum_{i=1}^{K}-2 \log g\,\left(\mu_{j}^{i};0,\left(\sigma_{\text{stat}}(\mu_{j}^{i})\oplus \sigma_{\text{ali}}(\mu_{j})\right)\right)\\ &=\sum_{i=1}^{K}\left(2\log\left(\sigma_{\text{stat}}(\mu_{j}^{i}) \oplus\sigma_{\text{ali}}(\mu_{j})\right)+\left(\frac{\mu_{j}^{i}}{\sigma_{ \text{stat}}(\mu_{j}^{i})\oplus\sigma_{\text{ali}}(\mu_{j})}\right)^{2}\right) +\text{ (constant terms)}\end{split} \tag{4}\]Results for \(\sigma_{\rm ali}\) in the 2017 toroid-off runs are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2. The value \(\sigma_{\rm ali}({\rm total})\) is defined as the quadratic sum of the three values \(\sigma_{\rm ali}(\mu_{0})\), \(\sigma_{\rm ali}(\mu_{\theta})\) and \(\sigma_{\rm ali}(\mu_{\phi})\).

Using the other toroid-off run recorded in 2018, the present analysis is repeated, and the results for \(\sigma_{\rm ali}\) are presented in Table 3.

As the amount of toroid-off collision data is limited, we cannot avoid completely to use the same samples in the performance analysis presented here that were used in the determination of the alignment reference geometry. This may lead to a too optimistic estimation of the alignment performance. The effect is particularly true for the barrel numbers reported with the 2018 data: the results of Table 3 are strongly biased toward too-good values for the barrel as the 2018 toroid-off collision data is used (along with toroid-off cosmics and optical sensors data) in the determination of the barrel reference geometry, using a track selection and weighting that is close to that of this analysis. The 2017 toroid-off collision run is not used in the barrel reference geometry, and the numbers in Table 2 are thus representative of the barrel alignment performance. For the end-cap, the same toroid-off collision runs are used for determining the alignment and analysing its performance, however the track selection and weighting is quite different from

## 4 Conclusion

The yellow bands indicate the range \(\pm 0.1\,\mathrm{mm}\). Regions of the muon spectrometer are differentiated: standard barrel large or small towers (BA large, BA small), standard end-cap large or small towers (EC large, EC small), forward end-cap CSC large or small towers (CS large, CS small), end-cap towers comprising EEL, EES or BEE (EE large, EE small, BEE).

this analysis, resulting in smaller bias, and the end-cap numbers of the two tables 2 and 3 are believed to be representative of the alignment performance.

For most of the acceptance, we observe an alignment performance between \(30\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) and \(80\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\), which is close to the design goal.

## 3 Performance validation with tracks in the small/large sector overlap

In toroid-on runs, a validation of the internal alignment may be carried out using tracks in the overlap regions between neighbouring small and large sectors. The principle is to select tracks with three stations of chambers in each sector (six in total). Such tracks may then be refitted in two independent configurations, retaining the hits of only one sector for each fit. The difference between \((q/p_{\mathrm{T}})_{S}\) (from the small sector fit) and \((q/p_{\mathrm{T}})_{L}\) (from the large sector fit) is computed for each track, and is averaged for every available overlap region.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l r r r r} \hline \hline  & \(\sigma_{\mathrm{ali}}(\mu_{0})\) [\(\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\)] & \(\sigma_{\mathrm{ali}}(\mu_{\theta})\) [\(\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\)] & \(\sigma_{\mathrm{ali}}(\mu_{\phi})\) [\(\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\)] & \(\sigma_{\mathrm{ali}}(\mathrm{total})\) [\(\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\)] \\ \hline BA large & \(24\pm 1\) & \(8\pm 1\) & \(13\pm 1\) & \(28\pm 1\) \\ BA small & \(57\pm 6\) & \(8^{+4}_{-6}\) & \(19\pm 3\) & \(61\pm 6\) \\ EC large & \(36\pm 4\) & \(21\pm 3\) & \(26\pm 3\) & \(49\pm 4\) \\ EC small & \(62\pm 8\) & \(40\pm 6\) & \(36\pm 6\) & \(82\pm 7\) \\ CS large & \(26\pm 4\) & \(23\pm 4\) & \(36\pm 5\) & \(50\pm 4\) \\ CS small & \(42\pm 6\) & \(13\pm 4\) & \(42\pm 7\) & \(60\pm 6\) \\ EE large & \(60\pm 7\) & \(17\pm 3\) & \(39\pm 5\) & \(73\pm 6\) \\ EE small & \(59^{+19}_{-15}\) & \(19^{+15}_{-19}\) & \(32\pm 11\) & \(70^{+18}_{-13}\) \\ BEE & \(104\pm 10\) & \(47\pm 5\) & \(41\pm 5\) & \(121\pm 9\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

For tracks with moderate momentum (around 50 GeV), multiple scattering is a significant contribution to the \(q/p_{\mathrm{T}}\) resolution. However, the two values \((q/p_{\mathrm{T}})_{S}\) and \((q/p_{\mathrm{T}})_{L}\) are affected in a correlated way, because there is only one muon trajectory. Hence in the difference \((q/p_{\mathrm{T}})_{S}-(q/p_{\mathrm{T}})_{L}\) the multiple scattering cancels out partially, and information may be obtained on the high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) detector performance, even with moderate statistics. The cancellation is only partial because the multiple scattering is a 3D effect, which will project differently in the planes of measurement of the two sectors, resulting in slightly different multiple scattering biases, with \(\eta\) dependence.

The following validation of the internal alignment performance in the small/large sector overlap is obtained with a sub-sample of \(7.3\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of the toroid-on physics data recorded in 2018.

First, tracks with precision coordinate hits in two sectors are selected, with three stations of chambers in each sector. The tracks are required to be combined muons, and to have a momentum \(p_{\mathrm{CB}}>20\) GeV. Regions of the MS not connected by the optical alignment system (in the barrel/end-cap overlap) are discarded.

For each selected track, two track fits are thus performed, retaining the precision hits of only one sector (large or small), but retaining the second coordinate hits of both sectors, and disabling the scattering centres.

The difference \((q/p_{\mathrm{T}})_{S}-(q/p_{\mathrm{T}})_{L}\) is put in a histogram, for each overlap configuration, i.e. for each sextuplet of crossed muon chambers. The histogram is subsequently fitted with a Cauchy distribution, whose mean value is extracted.

The mean \((q/p_{\mathrm{T}})_{S}-(q/p_{\mathrm{T}})_{L}\) deviation is shown for every overlap of the muon spectrometer in Fig. 6: most of the measurements lie within \(\pm 0.3\,\mathrm{TeV}^{-1}\), with some notable exceptions in the end-cap overlaps. The region \(1.0<|\eta|<1.3\) (EEL and EES towers) is mostly inaccessible to this analysis as the six-chamber overlap in this region is too small.

Using a similar method to what was presented in Eq. 4, overall alignment performance numbers \(\sigma_{\mathrm{SL}}\) are extracted from the distribution of per-overlap \((q/p_{\mathrm{T}})_{S}-(q/p_{\mathrm{T}})_{L}\), defined as the quantity to be added in quadrature to the statistical error of the per-overlap results to make their scattering around zero compatible with the total error.

\begin{tabular}{l r r r r} \hline \hline  & \(\sigma_{\mathrm{ali}}(\mu_{0})\) [\(\mathrm{\mu m}\)] & \(\sigma_{\mathrm{ali}}(\mu_{\theta})\) [\(\mathrm{\mu m}\)] & \(\sigma_{\mathrm{ali}}(\mu_{\phi})\) [\(\mathrm{\mu m}\)] & \(\sigma_{\mathrm{ali}}(\mathrm{total})\) [\(\mathrm{\mu m}\)] \\ \hline BA large & \(5\pm 2\) & \(6\pm 2\) & \(-0\pm 2\) & \(8\pm 2\) \\ BA small & \(16\pm 7\) & \(0^{+7}_{-0}\) & \(0^{+5}_{-0}\) & \(16\pm 7\) \\ EC large & \(26\pm 5\) & \(24\pm 4\) & \(17\pm 4\) & \(39\pm 4\) \\ EC small & \(50\pm 10\) & \(49\pm 9\) & \(31\pm 8\) & \(76\pm 9\) \\ CS large & \(29\pm 5\) & \(16\pm 4\) & \(24\pm 4\) & \(40\pm 4\) \\ CS small & \(26\pm 5\) & \(12\pm 5\) & \(23\pm 7\) & \(36\pm 6\) \\ EE large & \(49\pm 6\) & \(14\pm 3\) & \(21\pm 4\) & \(56\pm 6\) \\ EE small & \(74^{+25}_{-20}\) & \(52\pm 25\) & \(23^{+16}_{-23}\) & \(94^{+26}_{-19}\) \\ BEE & \(109\pm 11\) & \(49\pm 7\) & \(41\pm 6\) & \(127\pm 10\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

## 4 Conclusion

An updated set of muon spectrometer alignment corrections has been released for the reprocessing of 2017 and 2018 ATLAS data. The observed alignment performance is close to the design target of a high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) track resolution of the order of 10% at 1 TeV.
