**Abstract**

This note summarizes the results of MDT ageing studies conducted at the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility GIF between autumn 2001 and summer 2003, using for the first time a series-production MDT chamber (of type BIS) and a prototype of the gas recirculation system to be installed at Atlas.

The main outcome of the measurements was a very high sensitivity towards any silicone contamination of the Atlas MDTs when operated in a high rate environment. The ageing effects observed were traced to several contaminated parts in the off-chamber gas system, proving the paramount importance of an effective quality control during the gas system assembly and component selection process.

The measurements discussed here found their continuation in a second phase of tests at GIF between December 2003 and May 2004; these will be described in a separate note.

Introduction

Due to the complexity of the Atlas detector design, exchanging individual MDTs or muon chambers after some years of operation in case of a failure will be virtually impossible; a careful study of the factors limiting their lifetime is therefore essential. Typical symptoms of a performance degradation with time include losses in gas gain, a decrease of resolution or efficiency, excessive currents and the formation of sparks. The various effects are often summed up in the expression 'ageing'; in a stricter sense ageing refers to changes in a drift tube that are

* radiation induced,
* not reversible by a simple gas exchange,
* affecting the tube operation.

While numerous ageing studies have been carried out already during the design phase of the Atlas MDTs (see e.g. [8], [11], [10], [9]), they usually used single drift tubes in dedicated laboratory setups. Only in 2001 a full Atlas series-production chamber became available for further tests. This note summarizes the results of ageing studies conducted between autumn 2001 and summer 2003 with the BIS module-0. Among the main goals of the investigations presented here were

1. the evaluation of the MDT ageing behaviour when the drift tubes are irradiated over their full length,
2. the (re)validation of all material used in the series MDT production,
3. a first test of an operating mode close to the Atlas one in which the major part of the drift gas (Ar:CO\({}_{2}\)=93:7) is recycled and only a fraction is replaced by fresh gas in each cycle,
4. the evaluation of the longterm behaviour when using gas recirculation.

### Rate environment at the LHC

A large fraction of hits detected in the Atlas muon spectrometer will be due to background events rather than due to muons themselves. In the MDT case the main background contributions are photon and neutron interactions, where neutrons typically stem from secondary particles produced in the beam pipe and other machine elements as well as in the calorimeters. Photons are to a large extent created by (n,\(\gamma\))-reactions. The maximum expected MDT count rate is approximately 100 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) for chambers located in the inner part of the EI station [4]. Including a safety factor 5 to allow for uncertainties in the background simulations, the maximum rate an MDT must be able to sustain without significant degradation of its performance is defined as [3]

\[R_{max}=5\cdot 100\,\mathrm{Hz/cm^{2}}=5\cdot 300\,\mathrm{Hz/cm}\,. \tag{1}\]

Formula (1) translates into a maximum accumulated charge of

\[Q_{max}=5\cdot 0.12\,\mathrm{C/cm}=0.6\,\mathrm{C/cm} \tag{2}\]

in 10 years of LHC operation (\(10^{8}\,\mathrm{sec}\)), assuming a gas gain of \(2\cdot 10^{4}\) and treating all background events as photons with on average \(\bar{N}_{p.e.}=1235\) primary electrons created by the interacting photon.

Experimental setup

The ageing studies reviewed in this note were performed at CERN's Gamma Irradiation Facility GIF [1]; The 240 BIS MDTs, grouped into 2\(\times\)4 layers and each having a length of 170 cm,were irradiated over their full length with 660 keV photons from a 740 GBq \({}^{137}\)Cs source.

Cosmic muons were used to monitor the chamber performance in weekly reference runs with the GIF radioactive Cs-source'switched off', i.e. retracted into its lead housing. For all 240 BIS MDTs the drift time spectrum was recorded, using the 10k MDT prototype electronics (ASD-lite and AMT1), which was read out via the CSM0. With the ASD-lite the analogue signal after the shaping stage of the amplifier is available for every third channel for debugging purposes; charge integrating ADCs of type LeCroy 2249W were connected to these outputs in order to perform a pulse height - more precisely pulse charge - measurement for in total 75 of the 240 BIS MDTs. For this the differential analogue pulses were transformed into single ended signals by a set of pulse transformers. The position of MDTs for which a pulse height measurement was performed is shown in 1. 12 tubes, 6 in each of the two multilayers, were disconnected from HV when the chamber was irradiated with \(\gamma\)'s. They served as a reference in order to help disentangle potential changes in the gas gain due to temperature effects etc. from a real gain reduction due to ageing.

The conversion constant between integrated charge and ADC counts can vary from channel to channel. The LeCroy ADC 2249W has a mode in which these constants can be calibrated by supplying different d.c. voltage levels to a special calibration input. Such a calibration was performed at regular intervals and after each change in the channel assignment.

### Scintillator trigger hodoscope

The BIS chamber was'sandwiched' between 2 double layers of plastic scintillators; the coincidence signal of the hodoscope planes served as a start signal for the drift time measurement and was used to generate the ADC gate, which had a length of 1 \(\mu\)s.

Each hodoscope double layer consists of \(2\times 6\) scintillators with a size of \(110\times 20\) cm\({}^{2}\) each; they were arranged in a parallel configuration such that the second 6 scintillators are placed on top of the first 6, but shifted perpendicular to their axis by half a strip width (fig. 2) in order to achieve better granularity. The total active area of the hodoscope was \(120\times 105\) cm\({}^{2}\). The top and bottom plane of each double layer were read out to opposite sides; with the help of TDCs LeCroy 2228 is was thus possible to reconstruct the muon track position from the timing of the individual scintillator signals.

### On-chamber gas system

The BIS chamber was equipped with the standard Atlas on-chamber gas system in a fully parallel version, i.e. each tube was separately supplied with the operating mixture Ar:CO\({}_{2}\)=93:7 from the gas manifold ('gas bar') by a small tubelet. Since the measurements started before the decision to change the tubelet material to stainless steel was taken, the original brass version was used. The total chamber leak rate, including the gas manifolds, was measured to 9.2 mbar/day, which is slightly higher than the Atlas specification of 1.4 mbar/day (\(2\cdot 10^{-5}\) mbar\(\cdot\)l/sec. per MDT).

### Off-chamber gas system

Of the 240 BIS MDTs half (multilayer 1) were operated with gas recirculation, while for the remaining (multilayer 2) the classical flushing mode, in which the operating gas passes the chamber only once, was used. The operating mixture in both cases was Ar:CO\({}_{2}\)=93:7, supplied as a premix to keep potential changes in the mixing ratio to a minimum.

The complete off-chamber gas system is shown in a schematic way in figure 3; since the system has been described in detail in a previous Atlas note [5], the reader is referred there for particulars. Here it shall suffice to summarise the most important facts:

Both for tubes in multilayer 1 and in multilayer 2 the operating gas entered the MDTs on their readout (RO) side and left them on the HV side. The chamber was kept at 3 bar absolute pressure with the help of electronic pressure regulators (3),(10)3. The total gas flow through the MDTs varied between 1 and 2 volume exchanges per day (20-40 NI/h). For tubes in multilayer 1 90% of the flow was recycled while 10% of the gas was replaced from the premix supply in each cycle. The core component in the recirculation system is a high-speed turbine, the Argon Turbo Circulator ATC [2], to recompress the gas and thus compensate for the pressure drop occuring over the MDTs. The ATC is a custom-design by the Czech Company Ateko4 specifically for Atlas; the design is such that at no point the MDT operating mixture is in contact with any lubricated parts, thus minimising the risk of a potentially fatal contamination of the gas.

Footnote 3: Labels correspond to figure 3

A large diameter bypass loop ("big loop") had to be included in the recirculation prototype, in order to run the ATC at its nominal gas flow of 100 Nm\({}^{3}\)/h despite connecting only a tiny fraction of the later Atlas volume to the system. During standard operation less than 0.1% of the gas pumped by the ATC was'sent' to the BIS chamber by the flow controller (6); the remaining 99.9...% passed a 200 l buffer volume, which together with the flow restriction (15) simulated the rest of the Atlas detector. No purification or filtering stage was included in the prototype system, except for a stainless steel mesh retaining particles above 5 \(\mu\)m in size.

### Data taking periods

Due to the heavy demand on space and measuring time at GIF the ageing studies presented here had to be conducted in two phases:

* 5/3/02 to 10/5/02
* 27/9/02 to 8/5/03, with * Subperiod 'Age2a'
- 5/3/03 to 8/5/03

Period 'Age1' was preceded by a 2-month commissioning phase in Nov./Dec. 2001 and by two months of data taking (5/1/02 to 15/3/02) without irradiation5. Ageing investigations with the 120 tubes of multilayer 2 operated in flushing mode ended on March 5th, 2003. At that point the two multilayers were connected in series for the remaining two months of irradiation and operated together under gas recirculation (Subperiod 'Age2a').

The ageing periods were supplemented by 2 weeks of testbeam data taking with the X5 muon beam in May/June 2002; the results gained from these measurements can be found in [7].

The mechanical setups during the two ageing periods were different and are shown in figures 4 and 5. The main difference is in the relative orientation of the trigger hodoscope with respect to the MDT wire direction. This had the consequence that for phase 'Age1' the muon track position in wire direction could be reconstructed with an accuracy of \(\pm\) 5 cm directly from the pattern of scintillators showing a signal. During period 'Age2' on the other hand it was necessary to use the timing information from the TDC connected to the scintillators, which implied a larger uncertainty.

The two setups differed also in their trigger acceptance; the original design was such that the complete BIS chamber (170 cm tube length) was covered, with the exception of the first 30 cm, measured from the readout side, of multilayer 1. In the 'Age2' configuration only the first 105 cm, again measured from the readout side, could be monitored with cosmic muons.

### Naming conventions

Individual MDTs are referred to by a five digit tube number, which is defined as

\[tube\_ID=x\,y\,z\,aa\,; \tag{3}\]

\(x\) is the chamber number (1 in the case of the single BIS), \(y=1,2\) the multilayer, \(z=1..4\) the layer and \(aa=1..30\) the tube number within a given layer. Multilayers are numbered starting from 1 in the direction of traversing muons; the same convention is used for tube layers within each multilayer.

## 3 Integrated charge

The overall accumulated charge reached in the two BIS multilayers and its development with time is shown in figure 6; the different measurement periods can be clearly seen. The gas gain was set to \(4\cdot 10^{4}\) for phase 'Age1' and for the first weeks of phase 'Age2'; after this the gain was increased to approximately \(10^{5}\) while simultaneously doubling the gas flow (both fresh and recycled) in multilayer 1. The average tube count rate was 1400 Hz/cm in period 'Age1' and 1200 Hz/cm in 'Age2'. In the latter phase count rates decreased by almost a factor 2 over the chamber width due to the inclinded geometry of the BIS with respect to the vertical orientation. The minimum and maximum integrated charge is indicated by the two dotted lines in figure 6. On average a charge of \(\approx\)240 mC/cm was collected per tube and centimeter wire length until the end of the measurements in May 2003. This corresponds to about 40% of the LHC requirement specified in formula (2).

## 4 Methods of analysis

As has been pointed out above, the chamber performance was monitored during the ageing study with the help of cosmic muons in weekly reference runs. For each event the following information was recorded:

* drift time \(t_{drift}\) for all tubes traversed by the muon track,
* pulse charge integrated over a gate of 1 \(\mu\)s for all tubes with ADC readout,
* hit and timing information from the scintillator hodoscope.

Each data run, comprising typically between \(250\,000\) and \(400\,000\) events, was processed three times. In the first iteration, the position \(t_{0}\) of the leading edge of the drift time spectrum was obtained for all tubes by fitting a Fermi-function to the rising edge. Iteration 2 was dedicated to determining the ADC pedestals, \(Q_{ped}\); the last pass over the data used \(t_{0}\) and \(Q_{ped}\) as input and produced the actual pulse height spectra of the individual MDTs. Steps 1 and 2 could have been combined into a single one which was however not done for technical (programming) reasons.

During all ADC data analysis and separately for each MDT, events were classified into two classes, namely

* **Class A**: Events where the data for the tube under study contained an AMT reading, i.e. events where an ASD threshold crossing occured, implying that the tube'saw' a muon or a noise hit;
* **Class B**: Events where no ASD threshold crossing occurred, i.e. no AMT data word was present in the data for the tube under study.

Class B events were used to determine the ADC pedestal, \(Q_{ped}\). A Gaussian was fitted to the pulse height spectrum (fig. 7) for this purpose; \(Q_{ped}\) was then defined as the center of the Gaussian distribution.

### Analysis of class A events

The left column of figure 9 shows typical ADC spectra measured during the two ageing periods and - for comparison - during the test beam data taking; the ADC pedestal has already been subtracted in all cases. All three histograms show a tail towards large pulse charges \(Q\), which is typical for a Landau distribution; they however significantly deviate from the Landau shape for small values of \(Q\) in so far as the rising edge of the distribution is less sharp. The reason for this behaviour is the fact that muons traversing an MDT travel different distances in the operating gas, depending on the drift radius \(r_{drift}\) and the track angle \(\varphi\) with respect to the tube axis, and consequently produce a different amount of ionization. All pulse height data has therefore been corrected on an event-by-event basis for the actual ionization path length \(l_{ion}\) according to

\[Q_{corr}=(Q_{counts}-Q_{ped})\cdot c_{adc}\cdot\frac{30\,\mathrm{mm}}{l_{ion}} \tag{4}\]

with

\[l_{ion}=2\cdot\frac{\sqrt{b^{2}-r_{drift}^{2}}}{\sin\varphi},\qquad 1\, \mathrm{mm}\leq r_{drift}\leq 13\,\mathrm{mm}; \tag{5}\]

\(Q_{counts}\) is the ADC reading, \(c_{adc}\) is a channel specific constant ('ADC gain') for the conversion of ADC counts into a charge and \(b\) is the inner tube radius. The drift radius \(r_{drift}\) was calculated from the measured drift time using an appropriate rt-relation while the angle \(\varphi\) was obtained by performing a crude track reconstruction based on the hodoscope data.

The right column of figure 9 shows pulse height spectra for the different run periods after the above corrections were applied; the inlay in the two lower plots is the spectrum one obtains correcting for \(r_{drift}\), but not for the track angle \(\varphi\). A Landau distribution in the Moyal approximation

\[f(\lambda)=A\cdot\sqrt{\frac{e^{-(\lambda+e^{-\lambda})}}{2\pi}}\,\quad\, \mathrm{with}\,\quad\,\,\lambda:=\frac{Q-Q_{p}}{\xi}\,, \tag{6}\]was fitted to the histograms for all cosmics data; the most likely charge \(Q_{p}\) was then defined as 'the' pulse height for a given tube and run. Test beam spectra, which were used for temperature calibration, were fitted with the correct Landau function

\[f(\lambda)=\frac{1}{\pi}\cdot\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-s\ln s-s\cdot\lambda}\cdot \sin(\pi s)\,ds\,, \tag{7}\]

in order to better reproduce the sharp rising edge. The larger width of ADC spectra measured in periods 'Age1' and 'Age2' compared to the ones found from test beam data is explained by the fact that mono-energetic muons were used in the latter case, but not in the former.

#### Relative pulse height definition:

Since changes in temperature, operating gas composition or anode voltage all affect the gas gain, in addition to \(Q_{p}\) a relative pulse height \(Q_{rel}\) was defined as

\[Q_{rel}:=\frac{Q_{p}(\mbox{tube }xxx)}{Q_{p}(\mbox{reference tube})}\,, \tag{8}\]

in order to help disentangle such effects from true ageing. Reference tubes6 were disconnected from HV during irradiation, as pointed out in section 2.

Footnote 6: MDTs 11101 and 11106 in multilayer 1, 12403 and 12404 in multilayer 2

#### Temperature correction

The gas gain \(G\) of an MDT is highly dependent on the operating gas density and thus its temperature according to Diethorn's formula

\[G=\left[\frac{V}{a\cdot\ln\frac{b}{a}\cdot E_{min}(\rho_{0})\cdot\frac{\rho}{ \rho_{0}}}\right]^{\frac{\ln 2\cdot V}{\ln(b/a)\cdot\Delta V}}\,, \tag{9}\]

where \(a\) denotes the wire, \(b\) the tube radius, \(\rho\) the gas density and \(V\) the applied voltage. \(\Delta V\) and \(E_{min}\) are material constants ('Diethorn parameters') specific to the gas mixture. Instead of relying on equation (9) to correct measured pulse heights for changes in the temperature, a calibration was performed on the basis of the data acquired with the X5 muon test beam in June 2002, as can be seen from figure 8. The relation

\[Q_{p,20}=\frac{Q_{p}(T)}{1+(0.022\pm 0.003)\cdot[T-20^{\circ}\mbox{C}]} \tag{10}\]

was then used to correct all pulse height data to \(20\,^{\circ}\mbox{C}\).

#### Accuracy and systematic errors

The relative error estimate on the parameter \(Q_{p}\) returned from the Landau fit ranges from 0.3% to 1%, depending on the number of events for a particular run and tube. When comparing pulse heights from different runs, as done when looking for any evidence for ageing, the accuracy of the measurement is however dominated by systematic effects like changes in the exact operating conditions (gas mixture, anode voltage,...), shifts in the ADC calibration and temperature non-uniformities. A detailed analysis of the individual contributions and their impact on the overall accuracy has been performed as part of the studies presented in this note and can be found in [12].

The detection limit for ageing phenomena is estimated to be 3%, under the assumption that ageing occurs in more than one tube. Absolute pulse heights \(Q_{p,20}\) are assumed to be accurate to between 5 and 7%; they have larger uncertainties than the relative measurements \(Q_{rel}\) due to the temperature correction, which is necessary in the former case but not in the latter.

## 5 Results

### Results for BIS multilayer 2 -- vented gas system

The results for a typical MDT in multilayer 2 are shown in figure 10. The shape of the relative pulse height \(Q_{rel}\) as a function of either the accumulated charge or the time is consistent with a straight line with zero slope; the data therefore excludes ageing effects or a loss in gas gain exceeding the detection limit of 3% given in the previous section. The slight decrease in the absolute pulse height \(Q_{p,20}\) in the region marked as 'A' is thought to be due to the temperature correction (formula (10)) being slightly wrong. This is well conceivable, since (10) was derived from test beam data taken at temperatures between 18.5 and 24.5 \({}^{\circ}\)C, and thus had to be extrapolated to the lower temperature values during ageing periode 'Age2' (14.5 to 21 \({}^{\circ}\)C). None of the 38 monitored MDTs showed any distortion in the ADC spectrum.

The measurements confirmed Ar:CO\({}_{2}\)=93:7 as an ageing-free operating gas for the Atlas drift tubes; they further (re)validated all materials and components used in the construction of an MDT chamber.

### Results for BIS multilayer 1 -- gas recirculation

In contrast to the MDTs of multilayer 2, ADC spectra for MDTs operated with gas recirculation (BIS multilayer 1) started to show a distortion from an accumulated charge of a few tens of mC/cm onwards (fig. 11). The distortion progressed with time, with a clear double peak structure visible at the end of period 'Age2'. By using the hodoscope data to reconstruct the muon track position, a massive loss in pulse height in the first 30 to 40 cm from the readout, i.e. gas input side of the chamber was established as the cause for this behaviour, as can be seen from figure 12; the same figure also shows the result of a cross check done by moving a small radioactive source along the MDTs. In addition the following was established:

* All 33 MDTs of multilayer 1 kept under high voltage during irradiation and equipped with a (functioning) ADC readout show a decreased pulse height close to the gas inlet side, while the two reference tubes disconnected from HV during irradiation do not exhibit such a gain loss.
* A distortion of the ADC spectrum is visible from the first run of period 'Age2' (\(\approx\)20 mC/cm integrated charge); no spectrum distortion can be found for any 'Age1' run.
* The gain reduction and the spectrum distortion are progressing with time (fig. 13, left graph).

* For a distance greater than \(\approx\) 50 cm from the MDT gas inlet side no gain drop is observable over the full duration of the ageing study (fig. 14).
* The fraction by which the pulse height is reduced close to the gas inlet with respect to the opposite tube end does not depend on the level of irradiation, which varied by a factor 2 over the width of the BIS chamber, as described in section 3.
* The gain loss is significantly more pronounced for MDTs in layers 3 and 4 than for tubes in layers 1 and 2 (fig. 13, right graph).

#### Discussion

The observation of a gain loss solely in the region close to the gas inlet side of the MDTs strongly points to a contaminant in the operating gas rather than to a polymerization of the gas components themselves. A chemical analysis performed after the completion of the tests at GIF confirmed this suspicion, as discussed in the next section.

For ageing effects to be absent after the first few tens of cm, the contaminant has to attach itself very effectively to the wire, so that it is totally removed from the gas mixture after this distance. Alternatively one can speculate that in irradiating the drift gas and in the gas amplification process certain chemical substances ('active species') are formed, which catalyze etching effects and thus prevent the formation of wire deposits further downstream of the tubes. Such substances will typically be short-lived. In the MDT case they indeed cannot have an infinite lifetime; otherwise they would be re-introduced into the MDT gas stream by the recirculation system and no ageing should occur anywhere along the wire. If their lifetime on the other hand is finite, one expects ageing to re-appear when connecting a second set of drift tubes in series with the first one, with the gas flowing from the first to the second passing a region in which no gas amplification processes take place. To check for this possibility, BIS multilayer 2 was connected in series with multilayer 1 on the 5th of March 2003, 2 months before the end of ageing period 'Age2'. As can be seen from figure 10, no loss in pulse height was observed for the on average 50 mC/cm charge collected per tube in this configuration. It was thus concluded that etching or screening effects by active species did not play a role in the measurements presented in this thesis.

The reason why no distortion in the pulse height spectrum is visible for any 'Age1' run is the fact that in this period the first \(\approx\) 30 cm of the tubes, measured from the gas inlet side, were not covered by the trigger acceptance of the hodoscope. The cause for tubes in BIS layers 1 and 2 showing distinctly more pronounced ageing than tubes in layers 3 and 4 is unclear; the only significant difference between them is the different length (and inner diameter) of the metal tubelets supplying gas to the MDTs. It was at first believed that this might have caused different gas flows in the various BIS layers and thus a different amount of contamination introduced into the individual tubes and deposited on the wire; a direct measurement of the tubelet impedances however ruled out this hypothesis.

## 6 Chemical and surface analysis

After irradiating the BIS chamber at GIF ended, several MDTs of multilayer 1 were opened and samples both from the anode wire and from the cathode were removed. In order to confirm (or discard) the suspicion of a contaminant being responsible for the observed ageing effects and to find its source, various chemical and surface analysis methods have been used; their results are summarised in this section.

### MDT anode and cathode results

Figure 15 shows micrographs obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for different sections of the anode wire of MDT 11112. Pictures (a) and (b) were taken close to the gas inlet of the tube. A needle-like growth perpendicular to the wire surface is clearly visible, with individual whiskers having a length between 5 and 7 \(\mu\)m. The needles become shorter when moving further along the tube, as can be seen from graph (c), which shows the wire surface approximately 40 cm from the gas inlet. Close to the gas outlet side of the MDT no deposits on the wire were found (plot (d)).

The SEM results agree well with the pulse height behaviour discussed in the previous section. An EDX7 analysis identified the whiskers as consisting of silicon, oxygen and possibly hydrogen (plot (e)). Since silicon atoms are not part of any of the gases making up the operating mixture, the observed ageing effects are clearly due to a contaminant. Since pure silicon oxides are non-volatile and can thus not be transported by the gas, the contaminant almost certainly is a silicone with a (Si-C-)\({}_{n}\) backbone chain. On the other hand no carbon was detected; this is a clear indication that a complicated chemical reaction has to take place near or on the wire surface.

In several locations on the wire, structures in the shape of a perfect sphere with a diameter of 2 to 3 \(\mu\)m were observed (framed region in plot (b)); the EDX analysis revealed them as consisting of pure carbon. Since their number is small, they do not have any impact on the MDT performance. Samples of the cathode were also analysed; the results were unremarkable with mainly aluminium and oxygen being found by the EDX method, consistent with the tube material.

Footnote 7: Energy dispersive X-ray

### Results for gas system components

After the deposits on the anode wire were identified as a form of silicon oxide, efforts were made to locate the source of silicon(e) in the system. Since the gas used by the MDTs of multilayer 2 came from the same premix supply as the one for tubes in multilayer 1, the gas mixture itself could not be the origin of the contamination. Based on the same argument the components (endplugs, Al-tube, O-rings) making up an individual MDT were excluded from the list of potential Si-sources. The search concentrated on the components of the gas system, which was totally dismantled after the measurements at GIF ended. The following was found:

Sources of silicone:Silicone materials in contact with the operating gas were identified by IR-spectroscopy in one seal of the hygrometer, labelled (41) in figure 3, used to monitor the water content in BIS multilayer 1, and in the three large diameter valves of the bypass loop. The latter are believed to be the main cause for the observed ageing effects, since the hygrometer was present in the setup for phase 'Age2' only, while a pulse height loss is visible already for the very first run of this data taking period. The valves were recuperated from the Time Projection Chamber of the Aleph experiment at LEP, where they did not cause any problems during 10 years of operation and therefore were unfortunately considered as 'clean'.

The examination of the gas system also revealed a state of cleanliness far from perfect for some of the components. A hydrocarbon grease was found on several O-rings, in violation with the specification drawn up for the system assembly. Traces of oil were also found on the inside of the ATC compressor.

Conclusions and Outlook

The studies conducted at the Gamma Irradiation Facility and presented in this note revalidated Ar:CO\({}_{2}\)=93:7 as an ageing-free operating gas well suited for use in the high-rate LHC environment. All materials and components used in the MDT construction were also validated by the absence of any ageing phenomena in the MDTs operated in classical flushing mode. Tubes connected to the gas recirculation prototype on the other hand developed severe ageing effects due to the formation of silicon-oxide deposits on the anode wire, which clearly shows quality control as well as cleaning procedures were not yet sufficiently under control when the prototype system was assembled. A lot of work has since been spent on drawing up precise specifications and implementing validation procedures, both by the Atlas muon community and by the CERN PH-TA1-GS group.

Due to the observed pulse height reduction the goal of validating the ATC compressor could not be reached. Additional measurements at GIF were therefore started in December 2003 with a fully cleaned and reassembled system; a second aim of the new study is the test of MDTs operated with a serial gas system as used for certain chamber types (BIL, BML,...). Results of the new study will be summarised in a seperate Atlas note once the analysis is finished.
