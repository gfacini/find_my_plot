## Summary plots from ATLAS searches for pair-produced leptoquarks

This note collects summary plots with exclusion contours derived for four different pair-production scenarios of scalar leptoquarks. In all these scenarios, the decay products of the leptoquarks include only quarks from the third generation, whereas depending on the scenario they can either include third-generation leptons (neutral or charged) or first-/second-generation leptons. Several dedicated searches and two reinterpretations of searches for supersymmetric particles target these signal models. The full Run-2 dataset recorded with the ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb\({}^{-1}\). The contours indicate the observed and expected exclusion limits as a function of the leptoquark mass and the branching fraction of the leptoquarks into a quark and a charged lepton.

## 1 Overview of LQ Models

In total, four different models with pair production of scalar leptoquarks are employed in the summary plots in this note. The plots overlay contours obtained from different dedicated searches for leptoquarks and reinterpretations of two searches for supersymmetric particles, all of which are based on the full Run-2 dataset of \(139\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). No statistical combination of the different analyses is done. The previous versions of these figures can be found in Ref. [1].

### Third-Generation Model

Figures 1 and 2 present limits on the pair production of scalar leptoquarks, where all possible decays of the leptoquark into a quark of the third generation (\(t\), \(b\)) and a lepton of the third generation (\(\tau\), \(\nu\)) are considered. The limits are presented as a function of the leptoquark mass and the branching fraction into a charged lepton and a quark for up-type (\(\mathrm{LQ}^{\mathrm{u}}_{3}\to t\nu/b\tau\)) and down-type (\(\mathrm{LQ}^{\mathrm{d}}_{3}\to b\nu/t\tau\)) leptoquarks.

### Mixed-Generation Model

Figures 3 to 8 present limits on the pair production of scalar leptoquarks, where all possible decays of the leptoquark into a quark of the third generation (\(t\), \(b\)) and a lepton of the first or second generation (\(\ell\), \(\nu\), with \(\ell=e,\mu\)) are considered. The limits are presented as a function of the leptoquark mass and the branching fraction into a charged lepton and a quark for up-type (\(\mathrm{LQ}^{\mathrm{u}}_{\mathrm{mix}}\to t\nu/b\ell\)) and down-type (\(\mathrm{LQ}^{\mathrm{d}}_{\mathrm{mix}}\to b\nu/t\ell\)) leptoquarks.

### Signal sample generation

Simulated events with pair-produced scalar LQs were generated at next-to-leading order (NLO) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO 2.6.0 [2], using the method described in Ref. [3], in which fixed-order NLO QCD calculations [4; 5] are interfaced to Pythia 8.230 [6] for the parton shower (PS) and hadronisation. Parton luminosities are provided by the five-flavour scheme NNPDF 3.0 NLO [7] parton distribution functions with \(\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}=0.118\) and the underlying event (UE) is modelled with the A14 set of tuned parameters [8]. The mixed-generation model was produced in the same way but using an extended version of the IQ model of Ref. [3] that adds the possibility of decays to different generations. Signal cross sections were obtained from the calculation of the pair production of scalar coloured particles, like the supersymmetric partner of the top quark, as such particles have the same production modes and their pair-production cross section depends only on their mass. These cross sections are computed at approximate next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD with resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) soft gluon terms [9; 10; 11; 12]. The cross sections do not include lepton t-channel contributions, which are neglected in Ref. [3] and may lead to corrections at the percent level [13]. Madspin [14] was used for the decay of the IQ, where the couplings of the leptoquark to the quark-lepton pair are determined by two parameters: a model parameter \(\beta\) and the coupling parameter \(\lambda\). The coupling to a charged lepton and a quark is given by \(\sqrt{\beta}\lambda\), and the coupling to a neutrino and a quark by \(\sqrt{1-\beta}\lambda\). Note that for equal couplings, i. e. \(\beta=0.5\), the branching fraction will not be 50 % due to the sizeable top-quark mass. The samples were produced for a model parameter of \(\beta=0.5\) or \(\beta=1\), and target branching fractions were obtained by reweighting the samples based on generator-level information. The parameter \(\lambda\) was set to 0.3, resulting in a IQ width of about 0.2 % of its mass [15; 16].

## 2 Input Analyses

All contours shown in the summary plots have been or will be published in the conference notes or papers cited below.

Contours from the following seven dedicated analyses are included in the plots:

* \(b\tau\tau\)/\(\tau b\nu\): "Search for new phenomena in \(pp\) collisions in final states with tau leptons, \(b\)-jets, and missing transverse momentum with the ATLAS detector" [17],
* \(t\tau\tau\): "Search for pair production of third-generation scalar leptoquarks decaying into a top quark and a \(\tau\)-lepton in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV with the ATLAS detector" [18].
* \(b\ell b\ell\): "Search for pairs of scalar leptoquarks decaying into quarks and electrons or muons in \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV \(pp\) collisions with the ATLAS detector" [19].
* \(t\ell t\ell\) (\(2\ell\)): "Search for pair production of scalar leptoquarks decaying into first- or second-generation leptons and top quarks in proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV with the ATLAS detector" [20]. This search was performed in fully hadronic \(t\bar{t}\) decay channel.
* \(t\ell t\ell\) (\(3\ell+4\ell\)): "Search for leptoquark pairs decaying into \(t\ell^{-}\bar{t}\ell^{+}\) in multilepton final states in in \(pp\) collisions at 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector" [21]. This search covers di-leptonic or semi-leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) decay channels.
* \(b\ell\tau\)/\(t\ell b\nu\): "Search for pair-produced scalar and vector leptoquarks decaying into third-generation quarks and first- or second-generation leptons in \(pp\) collisions with the ATLAS detector" [22].
* \(b\tau b\tau\): "Search for pair-production of third-generation leptoquarks decaying into a bottom quark and a \(\tau\)-lepton with the ATLAS detector" [23].

Contours from the following reinterpretations of searches for pair production of supersymmetric particles are included in the plots:

* \(t\nu t\nu\): "Search for a scalar partner of the top quark in the all-hadronic \(t\bar{t}\) plus missing transverse momentum final state at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV with the ATLAS detector" [24].
* \(b\nu b\nu\): "Search for new phenomena in final states with \(b\)-jets and missing transverse momentum in \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV \(pp\) collisions with the ATLAS detector" [25].

## 3 Summary Plots

The summary plots are presented on the following pages.

### Scalar-IQ Up-type Third-Generation Model (\(\text{LQ}_{3}^{\text{u}}\))

Figure 1: Expected and observed exclusion contours at the 95 % confidence level for pair-produced scalar third-generation up-type leptoquarks with decays \(\text{LQ}_{3}^{\text{u}}\to t\nu/b\tau\), as a function of the leptoquark mass and the branching fraction \(\mathcal{B}(\text{LQ}_{3}^{\text{u}}\to b\tau)\) into a charged lepton and a quark. The mass ranges to the left of the contours are excluded for a given branching fraction. In addition to the dedicated searches for leptoquarks, the plot includes a reinterpretation of the search for pair production of supersymmetric top squarks with no leptons (\(t\nu\nu\)) in the final state.
