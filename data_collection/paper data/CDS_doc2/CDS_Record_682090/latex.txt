Signal readout in ATLAS EM Calorimeter

The basic principle of signal readout in a LAr EM calorimeter is illustrated in fig. 1. Ionization signal \(I_{d}\) delivered in detector cell \(C_{d}\) is taken via \(\approx 5\) m cable by line receiver preamplifier (0-T). The high voltage isolation at the 2 mm gap of LAr cell could be momentary broken by sparking due to different reasons (this is equivalent to switching on \(S_{1}\)) and in that case the energy accumulated at the coupling capacitance \(C_{b}\) ( kapton) connecting the electrode with the preamplifier will be delivered to its input transistor ( shown in the figure 1).

One of the possible solutions to limit the amount of this destructive energy, instead of making a continuous electrode, is to make a resistive coating between copper sections of smaller area. Nevertheless, the amount of energy can be still sufficient to damage preamplifier. This is why a protection network (P.N.) is put between preamplifier and electrodes. This circuit is realized using SMD components: 4 BAV99 diodes, a 47 nH inductor and a 200 \(\Omega\) resistor. We have established that the most sensitive component of PN is diode \(D_{1}\), which should absorb the negative part of a discharge pulse. In the early

stage of damage, when the preamplifier performance in terms of gain, noise and timing still looks good, this diode exhibit s the appearance of a second "knee" in its U-I characteristics (see fig. 2) and a slight increase of input capacitance (\(\approx 5\) pF).

It is obvious that the energy stored in \(C_{b}\) should be shared between all the components having ohmic resistance in the path of HV discharge signal. Unfortunately, we are not able to perform HV tests with a set-up exactly resembling the real chain detector-electrode-connector-cable. It is therefore useful to measure the margin of protection under ideal circumstances (zero resistance of discharge circuit) and then, multiplying by the ratio of full series resistance to the resistance of diodes, to evaluate the margin at arbitrary experimental conditions.

## 2 Series resistance of HV Set-Up

The series resistance \(R_{x}\) is a sum of the real part of the impedance of blocking capacitance, resistance of "spark", cable, contacts etc. After the relay is switched-on( fig. 3), signal

waveform U(t) on resistor R was measured and energy E dissipated by R is calculated as

\[E=\frac{\int_{0}^{\infty}U^{2}(t)\cdot dt}{R} \tag{1}\]

Let the energy \(E_{0}\), accumulated by the capacitance \(C_{b}\), is equal to

\[E_{0}=\frac{C_{b}\cdot U^{2}}{2}. \tag{2}\]

If \(R_{x}\) is unknown ohmic resistance of network and \(E_{x}\) is energy dissipated by \(R_{x}\), then the balance of energy is expressed in a following way

\[E_{0}=E+E_{x} \tag{3}\]

As long as \(R_{x}\) and R are connected in series(fig. 4),

\[\frac{E_{x}}{E}=\frac{R_{x}}{R} \tag{4}\]

Figure 3: _Direct measurement of energy dissipated by external resistor R after switch-ON of relay \(S_{1}\)._

\[E=\frac{E_{0}}{1+\frac{R_{x}}{R}} \tag{5}\]

Measurements are performed using both mechanical and Hg-wetted relays.

The blocking capacitor was high-Q silvered MICA 2.2 nF in case of mechanical relay and parallel combination of the same type high-Q capacitors with total 19.8 nF for the case of Hg-wetted relay. Digital scope (HP54510) was used in DC RMS mode, which allows to take integral (1) on-line. Resistance values R have been varied from 0.5 to 100 \(\Omega\). Also DC voltage on relay has been varied from time to time to check validity. Results of measurements are fitted by formula (5) with two parameters \(R_{x}\) and \(E_{0}\). The last parameter was introduced just to check that there are no another losses of energy and that the total energy delivered to system actually equal the value defined by (2).

Results:

* Hg-wetted relay (\(C_{b}\) = 19.8 nF): \(R_{x}\) = \(0.6\pm 0.06\Omega\) (fig. 5);

Figure 4: _Equivalent electrical circuit for the determination of the effective internal series resistance \(R_{x}\)._

* Hg-wetted relay (\(C_{b}=2.2\) nF): \(R_{x}=0.96\pm 0.08\Omega\) (fig. 6);
* Mechanical relay(\(C_{b}=2.2\) nF): \(R_{x}=0.9\pm 0.08\Omega\) (fig. 7).

From those data, we deduce that the impedance of "spark" is approximately the same for both types of relays \(\thicksim 0.5\Omega\) and that the series resistance of high-Q capacitance \(2.2\) nF is about \(0.4\Omega\). Later we have measured \(R_{x}\) in a set-up equipped with ceramic HV capacitor. We have found that its resistance is about \(1.4\Omega\). We never thought that the Q-factor of blocking capacitor is so crucial for protection network. Using low-Q capacitor, the major part of energy is dissipated on it and it looks like the threshold energy needed to damage diodes is 2-3 times larger then in reality.

## 3 Protection diode resistance

An other set of measurements was performed to find the energy dissipated by protection diodes and their equivalent ohmic resistance. The set-up is shown in fig. 8. Current

Figure 5: _Measured values of energy dissipated by R versus R in case of Hg-wetted relay with \(C_{b}=19.8\) nF. Nominal energy \(E_{0}=612\)\(\mu\)J_

flowing through diode has been defined by voltage drop on 1 \(\Omega\) resistor ( difference between Channels 1 and 2 on fig. 8). The second trace of scope (Channel 2) allows to measure voltage drop on diode. Two types of diodes were tested : BAV99 and BAS21. It is well known that a diode under the condition of very high density of injected current (\(\geq 10^{4}\,A/cm^{2}\)) has the potential drop across the junction which is negligible compared to the ohmic drop on both sides around the junction. It means that we can characterize diodes with only one parameter (resistance) in stead of the U-I curve. The measured values of equivalent resistance are the following:

* 0.6 \(\Omega\) for BAV 99 (0.3 \(\Omega\) for a couple of BAV99) and
* 0.3 \(\div\) 0.4\(\Omega\) for BAS 21.

Measurements have been done with both types of relays and the result s are very similar.

## 4 Effective resistance of cables

We have measured the effective resistance of cold and warm pieces of 25-\(\Omega\) cable in the frequency band of interest with the set-up shown in fig. 9. Resistance values were extracted by a fit of the measured dependence of energy E as a function of R, using the same procedure described above. Only mercury relay was used.

RESULTS:

* \(R_{x}=1.5\ \Omega\) (fig. 10)(5 m at 77K) + relay + contacts +.....
* \(R_{x}=1.1\ \Omega\) (fig. 11)(1 m at 300K) + relay + contacts +.....

To summarize, the cold cable has \(\approx 0.2\ \Omega/\)m and warm \(\approx 0.5\ \Omega/\)m, respectively. Those and all another values of resistances are presented in Table 1.

Figure 7: _Measured values of energy dissipated by R versus R in case of mechanical relay with \(C_{b}=2.2\ nF\)._

## 5 Thresholds to damage BAV99

Using the same set-up as in fig. 8 we have measured the energy dissipated by diodes as a integral

\[E=\int_{0}^{\infty}U(t)\cdot I(t)\cdot dt \tag{6}\]

All the data on thresholds to start damage of BAV99 are presented in Table 2.

Figure 11: _Measurement of an effective resistance of 1 m cable at 300K. \(R_{x}\) is equal to a sum of 0.6 \(\Omega\) from relay and cable contribution._

Summary and discussion

* In last series of tests we confirmed that the occurrence of low-value breakdown voltage in I-U characteristics ( about 3-5 V) of first diode BAV99 (\(D_{1}\))is a good indicator of start of damage, while the rest of protection network and preamplifier are still good.
* The threshold energy to start damage of a pair of BAV99 diodes is only 1.8 mJ. Putting an additional couple of diodes and 47 nH ( exactly the same circuit like protection in 0-T) increases this threshold up to only 2.2 mJ. Maybe is L=47 nH too much? Do we have to optimize its value respective to real conditions?
* The margin of the protection network can be expressed in the following form \(E=2.2mJ\cdot(1+\frac{R_{x}}{0.4\Omega})\), where unknown \(R_{x}\) includes resistance of cable, contacts, "spark" and real part of impedance of kapton capacitor. We expect that the spark in a LAr gap has larger value of resistance then Hg-wetted ( or mechanical) relay (i.e. \(\geq 0.5\Omega\)) and the kapton capacitor has a resistance in a range \(0.4\div 1.4\Omega\), but, nevertheless, it should be experimentally proved with real electrodes and cables. We must organize full-test of protection network.
* The use of diodes with lower value of ohmic resistance can help us. We are going to test alternative diodes ( PHILIPS BAS31, BAS21, BAS678 or Motorola MMBD7000LT1, which are supposed to have a lower value of R).
