###### Abstract

We present our best estimate of the radiation length of SCT endcap modules, based on our knowledge of their composition and measurements of their mass.

Our approach is to first try to understand the compositions and masses of module components. The conclusion of this section then feeds in to our prediction for the complete module. Any difference between the predicted and measured module mass is then used as a scale factor, which is used to produce our best estimate for the module composition. All of the raw data and calculations reported in this note are contained in spreadsheets available on the web [1].

**Changes since version 2:** NIKEHF inners have been re-weighed. Previous weighing mistakenly assumed that all handling frames were identical. New results are much more consistent with expectation.

A large number of hybrid flexes were weighed and thickness of layers measured in cut sections. The conclusion is that the copper layer thickness is around 17 \(\upmu\)m rather than the nominal 15 \(\upmu\)m. The calculation now uses 17 \(\upmu\)m and it increases the mass of flex and hybrid by 0.23 g.

**Changes since version 3:** New data on Freiburg inners and bug fixed in Middle spreadsheet.

## Module Components

Table 1 shows an overview of the calculated and measured weights of the principle module components for which we have reasonably large statistics.

There is good agreement between the calculated and measured **detectors**, not surprising given the well-defined dimensions and material of detectors. We take the calculated values as input to the module composition.

In the case if **spines**, there is not such good agreement between measured and calculated masses. In the second stage of our calculation we will scale the spine mass, based on the measured weight of the whole module. For the moment we remain with the calculated value.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & Calculated & Measured & No. & R.M.S. & Meas - Calc & Meas/Calc \\ \hline Middle detectors & 10.408 & 10.464 & 9 & 0.009 & 0.056 & 1.005 \\ \hline Middle spines & 5.769 & 5.591 & 12 & 0.061 & -0.178 & 0.969 \\ Inner spines & 3.542 & 3.469 & 7 & 0.092 & -0.073 & 0.979 \\ \hline Flexes & 3.149 & 3.195 & 21 & 0.219 & 0.046 & 1.015 \\ \hline Hybrids & 7.614 & 7.662 & 26 & 0.177 & 0.048 & 1.006 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

## Modules

Taking as input the measured hybrid mass and calculated values of all other component weights, we produce a calculated module mass for comparison with the measured values. The results for each module type are shown in Table 3.

There is generally good agreement between measured and calculated module masses for all three types of module. We take account of the slight disagreement by scaling the amount of material in the spine, fan-ins, washers and glue so as to exactly match the measured module weight. We do not scale the hybrid because that has already been done, nor do we scale the detectors because Geant will probably need the true detector thickness in order to correctly simulate the signal.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & Calculated & Measured & No. & r.m.s. & Meas-Calc & Meas/Calc \\ \hline Inner & 16.794 & 16.824 & 30 & 0.290 & -0.030 & 0.998 \\ \hline Middle & 25.577 & 25.292 & 28 & 0.170 & 0.285 & 1.011 \\ \hline Outer & 25.908 & 25.969 & 33 & 0.210 & -0.061 & 0.998 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Inner Modules

The distribution of inner module weights is shown in Figure 2. Our best estimate of the composition of inner modules is shown in Table 4. A scale factor of 0.9522 has been applied to the calculated mass of all components except the hybrid and the detectors, in order to exactly match the measured weight of real inner modules.

## Geant model of modules

We suggest that the modules are modelled in Geant with four volumes: One each for the front and back detector pairs, one for the hybrid, and one for the spine and all the other components. This last volume should fill the space between the detectors and extend up to the hybrid at one end and project by about 5mm at the far end.

## Elements in listed materials

The elements that make up the materials in the tables are not always clear from their names. Here is what we know about them.

* Kapton is polyimide; C\({}_{22}\) H\({}_{10}\) N\({}_{2}\) O\({}_{5}\)
* The adhesive and screen epoxy in hybrids and the araldite (2011) in modules are probably all phenol epoxies; C\({}_{6}\) H\({}_{6}\) O
* The Eotite P102 and the AIT in hybrids are both electrically conducting glues. They contain a significant density of silver, which gives them their short radiation length.
* The Elastosil in spines has been assumed to have the same properties as Araldite, though in fact it is a silicone rubber; Si H\({}_{2}\)
* The Glass D263 is made up of SiO\({}_{2}\), B\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), Na\({}_{2}\)O in the ratio 80:12:5 with 3% of something else.
* The FR4 is made up of epoxy and glass in the ratio 44:56 by volume.
