This document describes the details of the contents of the LAr Hadronic EndCap Wheel Assembly Database. This database contains the important data from the wheel assembly: mechanical alignment, electrical properties, cabling, and a summary of the readout gap failures. This document describes the final database that is intended mainly for archival purposes. This database should be viewed in conjunction with the HEC module production database that describes the modules that form the wheel and the Feedthrough database that describes the signal feedthroughs. This wheel database lists for instance the location of the modules, the amplifiers to which they are connected, and the details of the alignment measurements. It also details all non-conformances. It is important that for all non-conformances, whether they occurred during wheel assembly or in the B180 cold tests, that a single table be produced of all the non-conformances listing the non-conformance in a format suitable for making offline corrections to the data. This non-conformance table will be derived from a set of queries of this database.

This database covers the description of the HEC from the liquid argon gaps to the pins in the front end crate (FEC). As some non-conformances are described in terms of FEC module number and FEC module channel number some extension is included to this basic definition.

The database is initially being developed as a MS Access Database, initially maintained by the TRIUMF group. Now the data in this database is complete (as the work in B180 is completed), the data will be transferred to the CERN Oracle Database, maintained by the CERN IT group. This wheel assembly data will be maintained for the lifetime of ATLAS, and are useful for the experts who produced the HEC, and the end-users (technicians, physicists) to aid access to any or all pertinent details regarding a particular HEC module or component. In addition, it is required by the ATLAS Technical Coordination (TC) that any parts of the detector that will be moved to the ATLAS Cavern should have detailed data in the database at the time of installation.

**IMPLEMENTATION:**

The LAr Hadronic EndCap Wheel Assembly data is currently residing in the MS Access database 'HEC_Wheel_Assembly_Database'. This effort is now completed. The database will soon be permanently handed over to the LAr database group. This database will be migrated to the official CERN production database infrastructure upon final review.

**Figure 1 :** Architecture for LAr HEC Wheel Assembly Database. The _module serial number_, allows this database to be connected to the HEC module production database, by making a relationship on this entry between to two databases. The _Feedthrough Database_ connects through the feedthrough location identifier. Shown also is the highest level table the _Wheels & Cryostats Table_ that lists the four wheels and two cryostats described in the database.

_Outer Faces of the Two Sliding Rails_

Specimen value: 4255 mm, this being the distance between the two outer faces of the two sliding rails (the rails at 3 and 9 o'clock on the wheel, on which the wheel is supported). This number is recorded because it partly defines the outer envelope of the HEC.

_Maximum Inner Diameter (Plates 1-8)_

Specimen value: 746 mm, this being the maximum inner diameter of the hole in the middle of the HEC (for plates 1-8). This number is recorded because it partly defines the inner envelope of the HEC.

_Minimum Inner Diameter (Plates 1-8)_

Specimen value: 745 mm, this being the minimum inner diameter of the hole in the middle of the HEC (for plates 1-8). This number is recorded because it partly defines the inner envelope of the HEC.

_Maximum Inner Diameter (Plates 9-24)_Specimen value: 952 mm, this being the maximum inner diameter of the hole in the middle of the HEC (for plates 9-24), in which the Forward Calorimeter sits. This number is recorded because it partly defines the inner envelope of the HEC.

_Minimum Inner Diameter (Plates 9-24)_

Specimen value: 951 mm, this being the minimum inner diameter of the hole in the middle of the HEC (for plates 9-24), in which the Forward Calorimeter sits. This number is recorded because it partly defines the inner envelope of the HEC.

The table below gives the contents of this table in March 2004. The comment field has been truncated to allow easy reproduction of this table in this document. As row 1 is not completed at time of writing, row 2 will be used as table as our _specimen value_.

This identical to the front wheel alignment summary except:

\(\circ\) Maximum Inner Diameter (Plates 1-8)

\(\circ\) Minimum Inner Diameter (Plates 1-8)

\(\circ\) Maximum Inner Diameter (Plates 9-24)

\(\circ\) Minimum Inner Diameter (Plates 9-24)

are not present. Instead the following two items are present:

_Maximum Inner Diameter (Plates 25-40)_

Specimen value: 952 mm, this being the maximum inner diameter of the hole in the middle of the HEC2 (for plates 25-40), in which the Forward Calorimeter sits. This number is recorded because it partly defines the inner envelope of the HEC.

_Minimum Inner Diameter (Plates 25-40)_

Specimen value: 950 mm, this being the minimum inner diameter of the hole in the middle of the HEC2 (for plates 25-40), in which the Forward Calorimeter sits. This number is recorded because it partly defines the inner envelope of the HEC.

To give the reader a feeling for the variance in this value we have calculated the mean and RMS values. After ignoring null entries (where the position was not accessible), the mean and RMS for the entries is given in the table below.

\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|r|} \hline  & Gap Top Inner & Gap Top Outer & Gap Bottom Inner & Gap Bottom Outer \\ \hline Average (mm) & 1.72 & 1.78 & 1.77 & 1.62 \\ \hline RMS (mm) & 1.09 & 0.92 & 0.96 & 0.90 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The connecting bar that connects the adjacent modules together at the outer radius is a large flat bar. To marry this flat connecting bar to the many copper plates of the module which do not present a perfectly flat face, it was anticipated that shims would be used. One shim for each plate was anticipated. However it was found that these shims were not mechanically necessary, and as they were a potential source of metal material that can cause HV shorts, it was decided NOT to use them. We leave in the database the record of the measurements made to check that these shims were not required at any location. All these measurements were made on the wheel assembly table, prior to rotation.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline Cryostat/Wheel/Wedge1 2/PlateNumber & A/HEC1/4 5/10 & A/HEC1/4 5/11 \\ \hline Cryostat & A & A \\ \hline Wheel & HEC1 & HEC1 \\ Wheel Cryostat & HEC1A & HEC1A \\ \hline Wedge 1 & 4 & 4 \\ \hline Wedge 2 & 5 & 5 \\ Plate Number & 10 & 11 \\ \hline Shim Thickness Required & 0.718 & 0.656 \\ \hline Installed Shim Thickness & 0 & 0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

This table connects this wheel assembly database with the database that describes the 128 modules that make up the four wheels. This is done through the serial number of the modules. The items in this table have already been described in the description of the mechanical detail tables. For completeness we give below the reference drawings of the locations of the modules in the four wheels.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Voserview:**

One HEC wedge is equipped with 5 PSBs:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Amplifier Table & A & B & C & D & E \\ \hline PSB type & Gaps1-8 & Gaps 9-24, pads 1-8 & Gaps 9-24, pads 9-23 & Gaps 25-32 & Gaps 33-40 \\ \hline Quadrant Cabling Table & 1 & 2-1 & 2-2 & 3 & 4 \\ PSB type & & & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Table 1:** PSB labeling conventions.

The production volume was 75 PSBs of each type. All PSBs are named like "_A23_", where "_A_" is the PSB type, "_23_" is the serial number.

The PSB's A00, A01, A02, B01, B02, C00, C02, D00, D01, E00, E01 are "reference" PSBs, they were not used for HEC modules, so they are not included into data base.

During the QC tests, the main parameters of all preamplifiers were measured. A PSB passed the QC tests if all parameters were within the specified window. A summary of these parameters is given in the database. A review of the tests undertaken is given in:

Two pads are connected to every amplifier. So for instance 4 amplifiers are used to produce the signal for gaps 1-8, with gaps 1 - 2, gaps 3 - 4, gaps 5 - 6, and gaps 7 - 8 connected to them.

Given below are some typical values from this table. In what follows we will use the first row of this table as our _specimen value_.

_PSB Serial/Tower_

Unique identifier for this table in the database. This table includes some spare amplifiers. There are typically about 67 amplifiers of each type (64 are required) and about 19 towers on average peramplifier (A:24, B:8, C:15, D:23, E:24), total entries should be about 6000 entries in total. There are 6097 entries. Specim value: A06/1, where: A06 : PSB board serial number as described above 1 : Tower number from 1 to 24 (at most)

_PSB Serial_

Specimen value: A06, where: A06 : PSB board serial number as described above

_Tower_

Specimen value: 1, where: 1 : Tower number from 1 to 24 (at most)

See Figure 8 for the definition of these tower numbers.

_# Amplifiers in Tower_

Specimen value: 8, where: 8 : Number of amplifiers in tower (between 2 and 16)

_% Non-Linearity_

Specimen value: 0.76, where: 0.76 : Non-linearity in %, measured when varying the input current from 0 to 1 mA

The definition of the linearity was that the input current was varied from 0 to 1 mA (15 points), then the 15 points fit with linear (y = ax) function. Then the non-linearity is just the percentage deviation of the point furthest from the fitted line.

16/BEach HEC calorimeter wedge has 5 PSB boards, three on the front wheel (1, 2-1, 2-2) and two on the rear wheel (3, 4) (see table 1, page 25). They correspond to the 4 longitudinal readout depths (Z=1 to 4). The PSB boards have 3 output connectors. Signals from the outer psuedo-rapidity \(\eta\) region are collected at PSB OUTCON 1 (ETA=2-5), those from the middle psuedo-rapidity \(\eta\) region at PSB OUTCON 2 (ETA=6-9), and those from the inner region (ETA=10-15) at PSB OUTCON 3. Signals from 2 neighbouring wedges are transfered to patch panels with Harness A cables. There are 12 patch panels in a quadrant, four for each psuedo-rapidity \(\eta\) region:

* ETA=2-5 (OUTCON=1);
* ETA=6-9 (OUTCON=2);
* ETA=10-15 (OUTCON=3).

Harness B (Pigtail) cables serve to connect the patch panels with the feedthroughs. At the patch panel end they have 8 (8 signal pin) MPI connectors J1 to J8, at the cold feedthrough end an ATI connector (64 signal pin). Diagrams of patch panel connectors are shown in Appendix I. Connectors positoning at the HEC feedthrough warm flange and their mapping to FEC slots are shown in the figure below and Fig.??.

Feedthrough connectors (FT) column A are connected with FEB input connector J1 (FEB channel 1 - 64), those of column B - with FEB input connector J3 (FEB channel 65 - 128).

For FT column A the FEB channel number is equal to the ATI Pin number and for FT column B the FEB channel number is equal to ATI Pin number plus 64. The shaper channel number is equal to the FEB channel number minus 1.

There are 16 ADC's in the FEB. Each serves 8 channels. ADC 1 - 8 belongs to FEB channels \(1-64\), while ADC 9 - 16 belongs to FEB channels \(65-128\).

FEB connector J2 serves to transfer trigger sums from shaper mixer outputs to the baseplane.

Two trigger driver boards (TDr= 1 and TDr=2) are used to transfer trigger sums to reciever.

Cleland notations for TDr pins and channels are used (W.E.Cleland. Layer Sum Boards for the ATLAS Liquid Argon Calorimeters. EDMS Document ATL-AL-EN-0019)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:34]

There is one calibration board (128 channels) in a quadrant. 16 generators are used for calibration of one wedge using 6 for the rear and 10 for a front module:

\(\bullet\) \(\Delta\)Cal_Gen = (1 - 6) + (QWedge -1) x 16 for rear module

\(\bullet\) \(\Delta\)Cal_Gen = (7 -16) + (QWedge-1) x 16 for front module

Initially there were two tables in the data base: EC_A_upd and EC_C_upd for the quadrant of end cap A and C respectively. They differed in 2 columns: Wedge and PHI. Both items are reversed for EC_C_upd compared to EC_A_upd. For simplicity these two tables have been combined in this database. The column Cryostat has been added to allow these tables to be appended to each other.

The calibration lines are arranged in such a way as to be able to calibrate the calorimeter with the minimum number of lines. To avoid signal saturation at the summing stage of amplifiers different calibration generators for different parts of readout channels formed with more than the normal 8 pads (such as tower 5 in the gaps 9-24 depth, which is composed of 16 5a pads and 16 5b pads). Hence regions where tiles are split (into a and b) and/or the depth is 16 liquid argon gaps not the more normal 8, are calibrated by two or four independent calibration lines.

### Quadrant Signal and Calibration Cabling Table Entries:

_Cryostat/QWedge/Z/Sub_Z/Pad:_

This is the unique identifier for this table. Cryostat is either A or C. QWedge (described below) goes from 1 to 8. Z (described below) goes from 1 to 4, and combines with Sub_Z (1 or 2) to give the possibility of two entries for each \(Z=2\) entry. Pad (described below) is the descriptor for each type of pad in a HEC wedge. Table 3 lists all entries per wedge. At the bottom of table 3 the entries are summed. There are 28 Z = 1 SubZ = 1 entries, 27 Z = 2 SubZ = 1 entries, 25 Z = 2 SubZ = 1 entries, 22 Z = 4 SubZ = 1 entries, giving at total of 127 entries in total per wedge. In addition there are 9 redundant entries (cables present but not attached to towers, denoted by SubZ = 0) in this table per wedge. So in total there are 136 entries per wedge, giving with 8 wedges per quadrant and two cryostats: 2176 entries in this quadrant table.

_Cryostat/Qwedge/PSB_letter/Tower:_

This is the entry to connect to the table with one entry per signal line. There can be up to four lines in this table for a line in the signal summary table.

_Cryostat:_

A or C cryostats.

_QWedge:_

A wedge is the combination of a front and rear HEC module. It has a \(\varphi\) width of 2\(\pi\)/32 radians. Eight wedges make a quadrant. Thus the value of quadrant wedge QWedge goes between 1 - 8 in a quadrant. QWedge number increases with increasing \(\varphi\).

_PSB Letter:_

A letter between A and E, denoting the type of PSB board.

_Pad:_

All the pads are labeled according to the notation on page 287, ATLAS Liquid Argon TDR (reproduced below in Figure 7). A typical value is P1A, where P stands for PAD and 1a is the label on the drawing. 1 is the lowest psuedo-rapidity pad, and 24 is the highest psuedo-rapidity pad (having psuedo-rapidity = 3.2 as its nominal high psuedo-rapidity boundary).

_Gap:_

Within each Z region the tiles are readout in pairs. The first pair in a Z region is called channel 2, the second pair channel 4 etc.. The notation used by the gap identifier is the first pair channel dash last pair channel. Allowed values are: 2-4, 2-8, and 10-16. So for instance:

* Z=1, Gap = 2-8 corresponds to gap_new 1 to 8.
* Z=2, Gap = 2-8 corresponds to gap_new 9 to 16.
* Z=2, Gap = 10-16 corresponds to gap_new 17 to 24.
* Z=3, Gap = 2-4 corresponds to gap_new 25 to 28. (see for instance pad P3 in table 2)

_Gap_new:_

The liquid argon filled gaps between the copper plates in the HEC are numbered from front to rear: 1 to 40. Gaps 1 to 24 are in the front wheel, and 25 to 40 in the rear wheel. In this database numbers of gaps summed to make towers or sub-towers are given. Allowed values are: 1 to 8, 9 to 16, 17 to 24, 25 to 28, 25 to 32, 33 to 36, and 33 to 40.

_ETA_:

ETA is a number between 2 and 15. Below is a lookup table (table 1) between this ETA number and the nominal range of psuedo-rapidity the entry lies within. This number indicates which output connector is used from the PSB board for this entry.

Figure 9: Definition of the pads of the readout electrodes, as given in the ATLAS Liquid Argon TDR, Figure 8-5.

_PHI:_

For the inner tiles where there is only one tile across the whole module (pads 21 to 24) this number is equal to wedge. Where the module is two tiles wide (pads 1 to 20) it is twice wedge if the tile is on the high \(\varphi\) side of the module, and it is twice wedge minus one if it is on the low \(\varphi\) side of the module

\begin{table}

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:38]

_PHI_letter:_

This is the same as PHI except the notation instead of being from 1 to 16 is from A to P. PHI = 1 is equivalent to PHI_letter=A. This letter along with ETA defines the Trigger Towers in "Colas-Cleland notation". (W.E.Cleland. Layer Sum Boards for the ATLAS Liquid Argon Calorimeters.

EDMS Document ATL-AL-EN-0019)

_Z:_

This is the readout depth. Z=1 is the readout depth gaps 1-8, Z=2 is the readout depth gaps 9-24, Z=3 is the readout depth gaps 25-32, Z=4 is the readout depth gaps 33-40. See table 2 for conversion from Z to nominal position in ATLAS in mm.

_SubZ :_

This is 1 for all entries except:

* For entries with Z = 2 where it is 1 for the gaps 9-16 and 2 for gaps 17-24.
* For entries where the cable is not connected to a tower it is set to 0.

_PSB:_

Pre-amplifier and summing board (PSB) type used. Allowed values are : 1, 2-1, 2-2, 3, 4. Where 1, 2-1, 2-2 are on the front wheel and 3 and 4 are on the rear wheel. PSB n contains the amplifiers for readout depth n. PSB boards 2-1 and 2-2 are used for readout depth 2 (inner and outer regions). (See Appendix I)

_Incon:_

PSB input connector ( value 1 to 15).

_Inpin:_

PSB input connector pin this has a notation of the type: 1-2, 1-4, 5-6 and 5-8. Each of these represents a set of pins: 5-8 means pins 5, 6, 7, and 8 are used. Connected to each pin are a pair of readout pads. Each pin has an amplifier attached to it. Inside the PSB the various signals from the various pad pairs that make up a readout tower are summed and the anologue signal is sent out on a single output pin. As an example of this pin assignment notation in table 4 below we take tower 7 in the third readout depth where we sum pads 7a and 7b for gaps 25 to 32.

_OUTCON:_

PSB output connector ( value 1 to 3).

_OUTPIN:_

PSB output connector pin (1 to 8)

_Tower:_

This is the tower as defined on page 287 Figure 8-5 of the TDR (or the number in the **Pad** entry defined above). Note at this point in the readout chain divided pads such as 2a and 2b have been summed to provide a single tower (number 2 in the case of 2a and 2b). The tower can be derived from OUTCON and OUTPIN by:

\(\mathrm{Tower}=8(\mathrm{OUTCON}\)-1) + OUTPIN

\(\mathrm{Except}\) in the case of PSB readout channels, 22 and 23 where the output pin is switched, so:

\(\mathrm{Tower}\) 22 is connected to OUTCON 3 and OUTPIN 7

\(\mathrm{Tower}\) 23 is connected to OUTCON 3 and OUTPIN 6

This switching of the OUTPIN for these two pads was required due to engineering constraints in the layout of the PSB board and the mechanical design of the HEC modules (that did not allow all even numbered pads to be on the wiring harness on one side of the module and all odd numbered on the other side).

### HV Cabling Table

Two unique identifiers exist for each entry. The first defines the calorimeter volume served, the second the location of the pin on the cryostat serving this HV volume.

* The first unique identifier for this table is Cryostat/Wedge/Z/subgap, with 2 cryostats, 32 wedges, 4 Z depths and 4 subgaps, there are 1024 entries in this table. The table gives the wiring details for these lines.
* The second unique identifier for this table is Cryostat/HVfeedthrough/Pin, with 2 cryostats, 16 feedthroughs and 32 pins, there are 1024 entries in this table. The figures below define the locations of the pins and HV feedthroughs.

The entries for ISEG module and channel number are included for completeness but this is not the definitive definition of these. If for technical reasons these assignments are changed this database will not be changed. The database seeks only to define the items that will not change, in this case: feedthrough and pin number.

The unique identifier for this table is: Cryostat/Wedge/PSB/voltage. There are 2 cryostats, 32 wedges, 5 PSB per wedge, and 6 voltage lines per PSB. In addition there are two shield lines per wedge: 2048 entries in this table (2x32x(5x6+2) entries).

This table describes the wiring of the low voltages that power the PSB boards which are mounted on the modules in the liquid argon. These low voltages are supplied from a power supply box, feed into the front end crate (in slots 37 and 38), and then through the signal feedthroughs to the PSB's of the HEC.

### Description.

One Power Box is used to supply low voltage to each HEC quadrant. Each Power Box has 40 Low Voltage Channels (a channel being a set of 3 voltages suitable for supplying one PSB), produced on 8 output connectors each with 5 channels. The Power Box output cables 1 to 4 are connected to four inputs of LV FEB1 (slot 37), cables 5 to 8 to those of LV FEB2 (slot 38). Outputs of FEB1 are connected with signal feedthrough (FT) 14A (J1) and FT 14B (J3), and those of FEB2 with FT15A (J1) and FT15B (J3). In the cold the LV pigtail has an ATI connector at the feedthrough end and 10 MPI connectors A1-E1, A2-E2 at the patch panel end. Each HEC quadrant is equipped with 4 Low Voltage patch panels (LV PP) each of these serves two neighbouring wedges (Wedge = n, n+1) For both End-Caps the connectors (A1-E1) belong to a wedge n, and (A2-E2) to wedge n+1. Connectors sets 1 and 2 are swapped at End Cap C patch panels. Two MS Excel tables were produced describing this situation for each end-cap: HEC_LV_A andHEC_LV_C. These have only one difference: in the table HEC_LV_A LV PP is ordered by wedge number, while in the table HEC_LV_C LV PP is in the inverse order. During feedthrough cabling installation it was found that some swapped voltage and ground lines had been produced. Two new tables HEC_LV_A_new and HEC_LV_C_new with swapped voltage and ground lines were produced and are used in this database. In the list of items below the label used in these files for each entry is given in brackets.

List of items:

1. **Cryostat/Wedge/PSB_letter/Voltage** Unique identifier for this table

Qwedge is 1 for the first wedge in a quadrant and goes up to 8 for the final wedge in the quadrant.

## Appendix I

TDR Measurements and Reconstruction of HEC Cable Parameters in the EC-C cold test (reproduced here from ATL-AE-QR-0001 v.1)

The TDR waveform displays structure that indicates the wave impedances in the line and its termination conditions. The HEC signal line (PSB to Baseplane) is a set of cables:

The measurements were done with TDS 8000 oscilloscope running in TDR mode. The instrument settings are shown in the table below. One channel (CH1) was used for all tests. The measurements were not automated, as all re-plugging operations were done manually.

\begin{tabular}{l l l} \hline VERT & Scale & 100 mV/div \\  & Offset & 250 mV \\ \hline HOR & Scale & 20 ns/div (50 for calibration channels) \\  & Offset & 21.4 ns \\  & Length & 4000 samples \\ \hline ACQ & Type & Average \\  & N of samples & 50 \\  & Stop & Condition \\  & N of acquisitions & 50 \\ \hline TRIG & Source & Internal \\  & Frequency & 25 KHz \\  & Mode & Auto \\ \hline TDR & Channel & C1 \\  & Scale & V \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Each waveform is saved in an ASCII file with csv format. The file name reflects the board number and channel number e.g.: s1a33.txt means FEB (signal) line of FEB \(\#\)1, connector "a" (first half of FEB, "b" corresponds to the second half of FEB), channel 33. Other files are: "p" - re-measurement of signal channel, "c" - calibration line, "d" - calibration line with 50 ns/div (200 ns is not enough to see allthe line). There is no quadrant number in the file name because the files are grouped in four folders, one per quadrant.

There is a mismatch between in-board channels numbering and TDR file numbers. File number 01 corresponds to pin A32 of the baseplane connector while the FE boards starts with C32. Channel number (counted from 1, not 0) can be obtained from file number by applying simple odd-even transform.

There are 128 calibration lines and 768 signal lines per quadrant, so in total 3584 measurements are done. In the case that the measurement quality was in doubt, the test was repeated.

A typical oscillogram for signal line is shown below. Each part of the line can be recognized in the waveform:

Similar waveform for calibration line (from baseplane to the end of strip line):

[FIGURE:S4.F1][ENDFIGURThe vertical scale, originally measured in mV, is recalculated to equivalent impedance:

\[Z=50\Omega\cdot\frac{V}{500mV-V}\]

For each cable a time window is defined as shown at the next two plots. The cable parameters are determined by analyzing data from corresponding window. The impedance of W and V cables are determined from the minimum value found in slots [t1, t2] and [t2, t3] respectively. For long cables: pigtail (P), quadrant (Q), calibration (C) and stripline (S) both wave impedance and serial resistivity can be reconstructed. It is done by a linear fit of the corresponding subset of points: [t4, 5] for P-cable, [t6, 7] for Q-cable, etc.

Then, the resistivity is determined from the slope of the fit line. It is measured in \(\Omega\)/ns. The wave impedance is obtained from the value of fit function in the area of the cable start point: t3 for pigtail, t5 for quadrant cable, t8 for calibration cable and t10 for strip line. To obtain a better estimation of the wave impedance, the integral resistivity of all cables up to this point has been subtracted. Such subtraction is done only for Q-cables and not done for others. Therefore the reconstructed value is not exactly the cable wave impedance. It is shifted with respect to the real value by few \(\Omega\). Another source of shift is the inexact definition of the cable starting point.

The length of each cable can not be accurately determined because all the lines have nearly equal impedance of 50 \(\Omega\). Also there is no well defined boundary between two consecutive cables because of signal slow down due to skin effect in the cables. But the total length of signal line can be easily estimated. It is done only for FEB lines where the PSB is connected. For disconnected channels it makes no sense and thus this parameter is fixed to 0. The beginning of the chain is defined as t1 and the end of the chain is determined in the region of 150 ns (upper plot of the last figure) when the waveform starts to rise rapidly. The end point is calculated as a point where waveform crosses the level of Q-cable impedance plus 5 \(\Omega\). Then the propagation time is the distance between end point and t1.

Other reconstructed parameters are PSB output impedance (impedance at the end of the FEB oscillogram) and strip line termination (impedance at the end of the CAL oscillogram). These values are calculated as an average over last 10-20 samplings.

The distributions of the cable parameters both for the signal and calibration lines can be found in a separate EDMS documents:
