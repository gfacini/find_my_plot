Abstract

Information on the light yield for the different radial layers of tiles inside a cell is provided by the source calibration scans and by the response of the calorimeter to muons impinging at 90 degrees with respect to the plane of the tiles. The results obtained from these two data sets are compared and interpreted in terms of a model based on a parametrization of the fiber and tile response. A more detailed study of individual tile row responses indicates additional effects that need further investigation.

The Source Calibration Data

### The Source Calibration systems in 1996.

Two source drives were tested during the summer of 96 [1].

1.- The hydraulic drive: A capsule containing a 8 mCi \({}^{137}\)Cs source is propelled by a hydraulic system across the hollow tubes that traverse the calorimeter. As the source passes through a cell the current induced in the PMT is measured, by means of an operational amplifier integrator with a time constant between 0.7 and 10 ms [2]. A typical spectrum is shown in Fig. 1. Peaks and valleys in the structure appear as the source passes through tiles and steel respectively. The current is sampled approximately every 3 mm. In these data, the peak-valley structure is suppressed due to an electronics problem which was corrected in 1997.

2.- The pneumatic drive: In this system compressed air was used to push the source capsule down the tubes. The capsule, restrained by a thin flexible line, is released at constant speed by an appropriate spooling mechanism. The measurement of the source signal is done as in the previous system. In these data, the peak-valley structure is more evident due to the smaller speed of the pneumatic drive.

### The Data.

Most of the results presented here were obtained with source calibration data taken with the hydraulic drive. Some cross-checks were made with data from the pneumatic system. The precision of an individual measurement of the response is 0.7 % as extracted from repeatibility measurement [3]. All Cesium runs have been analized. For what concerns the present study they all give similar results. The source data presented here belong mostly to run number 1048 taken on September 6th.

The analysis of the data proceeds as follows:

1.- The integral of the current structure measured in a cell is proportional to the amount of energy deposited in the calorimeter, the light yield of that particular cell and the quantum efficiency and gain of the PMT. In order to compare cells of different width, the integral of the response curve (fig. 1) is divided by the cell width measured in number of samplings of the current. Note that this normalization also eliminates the effect of any variation of source velocity from run to run.

2.- The source traverses a row of tiles in a cell through a hole situated at 15 mm from edge. Due to the range of the photons in the calorimeter structure, about 77% of the energy is deposited in that row, 22% in the closest neighbour and about 1% in the row situated on the opposite side. Those fractions were estimated by MC simulation and are in agreement with source data obtained with the Tilecal prototype modules ([4]). In the hydraulic drive the source went through the lower hole of tiles, i.e. the one on the inner radius while the pneumatic system used the other hole. In order to extract the response of a particular tile row, this effect has to be unfolded.

3.- The particular case of the two rows of tiles adjacent to the border between the two sub-cells of sample 2 (see Fig. 2) has also to be considered. An example of the curve obtained in one of the sub-cells is shown in Fig. 3. This case is a useful example, that shows what happens when the source goes along tile row 7. The first bump shows the 22% of light that gets deposited in row 6 of cell BC4 when the source traverses tile row 7 in cell BC3. Then we find that all light is collected in cell BC4, and this is the large second bump. Finally, the third bump is when only 77% of light is deposited in cell BC4, the 22% is collected in tile row 6 in cell BC5. This was taken into account when unfolding the light budget from the current measured in cells of tile 6 or 7.

A few cells have been discarded from this analysis. PMTs 9, 15 and 16 presented readout problems and all the PMTs reading the cells on the high \(\eta\) side were partially equipped with the new profiles and did not present a uniform response. The unfolded individual tile row response for all PMTs used for this study are given in Tables 1, 2 and 3.

The Data taken with Muons at 90 degrees.

Information complementary to the source calibration data is provided by data where muons impinge at 90 degrees to the tile plane in the center of the tiles. The results presented here come from runs from 11859 to 11869 (one run per tile, taken on September 16th, 1996) and from 11235 to 11245 (this set of runs does not contain tile 5, taken on September 6th, 1996). The aim of this study was to check the consistency between the source and muon results.

During the September 1996 testbeam the Barrel Module 0 was read out by the FERMI system that samples the signal every 25 nsec. The muon data were analysed with the Tilemon software ([5]). Two methods to reconstruct the signal from the set of FERMI samples have been compared: the full integral consists in summing up the set of 40 samples; in the filter method the filter function algorithm calculates the sum of 5 samples ([6]) provided by FERMI around a maximum applying appropriate weights. The maximum for this algorithm was fixed to sample 14. The muon signal obtained with the filter method presents a smaller width to peak ratio than the one with the integral method (see fig.4). The filter method has been used in this study. As in the case of the source, the muon signal is normalized to the width of the cell, in this case the number of scintillator tiles forming each row of that cell.

For the muons at 90 degrees data we have used the results obtained by T. Davidek ([7]), which apply the parametrization for the muon response proposed by T. Davidek & R. Leitner ([8]). The Fermi look up table (LUT) used is the one from November 1996. We checked that the differences introduced by using a more recent LUT do not alter the conclusions of this study.

The repeatability of the fit to the muon signal can be inferred from the study of the stability of the ratio of muons signals for two different tiles in a cell in the two sets of available runs. The "ratio-of-ratios" method [9] was used; the results are given in fig. 5. The distribution of the "ratio-of-ratios" has a rms of 2.9%; which indicates that the muons response is repeatable with an error of 1.5% (i.e. 2.9 divided by the square root of 4).

The results of the fit to the muon spectra can be found in Tables 4, 5 and 6. Data from PMT 39 were not used because of a high pedestal. The tables of results is presented for the set of PMTs common to muons and source.

The light yield of Module 0 as measured with Source and Muon data.

At this point data from muons and source can be compared to the model, developed by the Lisbon Group ([10]). It consists on one hand on parametrizing the fiber response by a sum of two exponentials with a long (\(L_{att}^{long}\)=250 cm) and a short (\(L_{att}^{short}\)=25 cm) attenuation length. The reflection coefficient of the aluminized end of the fibers is set to _R_=0.75. These parameters were chosen according to the measurements done by the Pis a Group ([11]). So, in the model, the fiber response is calculated as:

\[f(x,L)\ =\ I_{0}^{short}\ e^{-\frac{x}{L_{att}^{short}}}\ +\ I_{0}^{long}\ e^{-\frac{x}{L_{att}^{ long}}}+R(I_{0}^{short}\ e^{-\frac{2L_{att}^{short}}{L_{att}^{short}}}\ +\ I_{0}^{long}\ e^{-\frac{2L_{ att}}{L_{att}^{long}}}) \tag{1}\]

where \(I_{0}^{short}\)=3.1 and \(I_{0}^{long}\)=4.8 (in arbitrary units). \(L\) is the fiber length and \(x\) is the distance along the fiber length between the hole illuminated by the source and the PMT.

On the other hand the tile response is parametrized as a function of the tile size ([12]).

\[t(i)\ =\ K_{1}\ +\ K_{2}\frac{w(i)}{a(i)} \tag{2}\]

where \(K\)1=0.49 and \(K\)2=105.2 (in arbitrary units); \(w\) and \(a\) are the width and the area of the tile.

First we discuss the average response of the module as a function of the tile row and then turn to study the individual cell response.

### The response average over tile rows.

For each tile row the average of the different cell responses was calculated. For the model, the dispersion (and rms) for each tile row average arises from the different fiber lengths corresponding to each cell. The same subsample of cells was used for source, muons and the model. The results are shown in figures 6 and 7 and can be summarised as follows:

1.- The same basic features of the profile are seen with source and with muons (see Fig. 6), which are seen to be in good agreement. This is illustrated further by looking at the correlation between the results obtained for individual cells in the two sets of data. Figures 8 and 9 show a clear correlation. The rms of the correlation is 6.6%. Note the non-zero intercept of the correlation line, this indicates some uncontrolled systematic effect (for example, a problem in the pedestal subtraction could produce such effect).

2.- The trend of the longitudinal profile is, to a first approximation, explained by the model (see figure 7). The main disagreement between the model and source-muon dat a is found for tiles 6, 7 and 8.

In order to get more insight to the problem we studied, with the help of the model, the different contributions coming from tiles and fibers. Figure 10 shows separately the contribution to the non-uniformity of response from fibers and tiles in a Barrel Module 0 configuration. The two effects compensate in first approximation except for the case of tiles 7, 8 and 9 where fibers appear to be too short. For the compensation to work effectively 10 cm should be added to the fiber lenghts of tiles 7, 8 and 9. Figure 11 shows the expected longitudinal profile for Module 0 in that case. A better uniformity is obtained. Hence, two conclusions can be reached:

1.- The disuniformity between the two subsamples of sample 2 can be controlled by a fine adjustment of the fiber lengths.

2.- There is a remaining disuniformity: the one of tile 3 with respect to tiles 1 and 2 (or tile 6 with respect to tiles 4 and 5, etc.). This is a consequence of the fact that two different tiles are read by the same fiber, and the remaining disuniformity is governed mostly by the difference in the light yield in the two tiles.

In conclusion, the features are explained globally by the model, but some discrepancies appear, such as the relative response of tile 7 and 8, which is almost equal for the model but not for the data.

### The individual cell response.

The individual cell response, rather than average response for a tile row, was investigated next.

In Module 0, the different cells of a sample have different fiber lengths (see Fig. 2). The ratio of the response of tile7/tile4 and tile8/tile5 should depend only on the difference in fiber lengths. That difference can vary from 40 to 70 cm. Following the model, the dependence of the ratio 7/4 and 8/5 on that difference should be to a first approximation linear as shown in Fig. 12 and with a maximum expected difference of about 9%; also, the ratios 7/4 and 8/5 should be the same for the same fiber length difference. But when the same distribution is done for source and muons, a large dispersion appears, see Fig. 13 and 14. We can see that the behaviour of PMTs in tile 7 and 4 (open dots) is compatible with what the model predicts (more clearly with muon data than with source data). However the 8/5 response ratio is higher than predicted by the model, has a large dispersion (around 20 % or more) and shows no correlation with the difference in fiber lengths. The signal of tile 8 is higher than expected: this effect is seen in both source and muons (the same discrepancy was already observed in the average longitudinal profile plot of fig. 7). In this subsample of data, the correlation between the source and muons response for this ratio of signals is again clearly seen and good to 6 % (see Fig. 15), so this unpredicted dispersion must be due to some effect, in the fibers, the tiles or the routing that is not considered in the model.

To see if the effect is due to the fibers or to the tiles we compared the response from the two sides of the module ("left" and "right" PMTs). Figure 16 (source data) shows the difference of response left - right for tiles 1 to 9 included. Muons give consistent information. There are large differences between left and right of up to 10-20 %. This cannot be explained by the small differences in the fiber lengths that read the left and right side of a cell. These are only about 5 cm, and should not contribute to the dispersion by more than 2 %; this difference is due to the asymmetric location of left-right PMTs on the two sides. In addition the left side should be systematically larger than the right side, which is not the case.

Figure 17 shows two examples with a large difference left/right. The plots on the left show left and right PMTs for tiles 2 and 5 that give an equal response as a result of the fact that those tiles have been used for the equalization. The bottom left plot shows two equal dips. This is suggestive of one (or two) tiles giving less signal; it is unlikely that both dips are due to a default in both the left and right fibers.

The two right hand plots show the responses from tiles that belong to the same read-out cell but are not equalised by the gain setting process. The left/right differences are larger than could be expected. The top right plot shows a left/right difference of about 6%; however the two structures are very similar in form. This is not so for the bottom right response curves; where the dips and bumps are not coincident. Instead, it appears that a dip in one tile is coincident with a bump on the other. In this case, the anomaly most likely is associated to some fault in one or more fibers.

Another information from fig. 17 is that the individual tile or fiber "effects" are not sufficient to account for the fluctuations of the ratios shown at the beginning of this section. This was more clearly seen in the study of individual fiber to fiber fluctuations and tile to fiber coupling inside a tile row of a cell ([13]). The current spectrum in a cell is fitted by the sum of the individual tile response. A symmetric exponential form has been chosen to represent the variation of individual (tile + fiber) signal vs the distance (positive or negative) of the source from the axis of the tile. An example of the fit to pneumatic source data can be seen in fig. 18. The attenuation length of this exponential, and the distance tile to tile, in source coordinate units, are kept the same within a cell. These two parameters come out in good agreement with the values expected from the module geometry and the attenuation lengths of Cs\({}^{137}\) gammas in iron. The maximal signal is determined tile by tile by the fit. The responses of approximately 400 tiles are shown in fig. 19. The values are given relatively to the average response for each source current spectrum, i.e. for each tile row in a cell, to exclude contributions from residual PMT miscalibrations or effects due to different fiber lengths. The sigma is 5%. A few entries are far away in the tail, but altogether individual fiber effects cannot explain the dispersion we see in fig. 16.

To further investigate the effect, we separated the sample in tiles connected to the same fibers (fig. 20) and tiles connected to different fibers (fig. 21). In one case a strong correlation is observed while in the other case not. This is yet another indication than the effect seems to be connected to the fibers themselves and not to the tile-fiber connections.

So this large dispersion seems to originate at the level of the bundles or subbundles. A closer look should be given to the data to see if the effect can be correlated to how the bundling was done, like the grouping in subbundles or their curvature.

Conclusions

The Lisbon model explains the basic features of the average longitudinal profile of light budget for the Barrel Module 0. There is an intrinsic disuniformity caused by the fact that two sets of tiles of different size are read by the same fiber. In the configurations of the Barrel Module 0 (3-6-2), the second sampling is built out of two groups of 3 tiles connected to different fibers. The difference in fiber length between these two groups has to be finely tuned to optimize the uniformity of the longitudinal profile.

A large dispersion is observed between cells inside a row that cannot explained by the fiber length or individual fiber-fiber fluctuation, or tile-fiber connection. This dispersion may find its origin in the bundles or subbundles. It should be further investigated in terms of the routing.
