Abstract

We describe a dedicated trigger for the ATLAS-Muon Spectrometer. The proposed detector combines two technologies, the Resistive Plate Chambers and the Thin Gap Chambers, in order to obtain the best triggering result in terms of time resolution, rate capability and cost.

(*) Institutions not yet committed with the Atlas collaborationIntroduction

Leptons play a crucial role in the physics at the LHC. In particular an efficient level-1 Muon trigger with a large rapidity acceptance over a wide range of \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) thresholds is essential for the discovery of new processes as well as for the study of heavy quarks.

In past and present collider experiments the muon detection has been characterized by a relatively clean environment in which muons were easily identified as penetrating particles beyond the central calorimeters. The expected experimental conditions at the LHC are different: very small cross sections for the interesting processes, high background environment, tight timing requirements and very large area coverage. Therefore the first level muon trigger system must be robust, redundant and fast with a good and flexible momentum measurement capability; the detectors should be simple and cost effective.

In this note, a Dedicated Trigger System for the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer is proposed which uses a combination of two types of detectors, the Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) and the Thin Gap Chambers (TGC). Both RPC and TGC provide solutions that satisfy the above requirements in a way that optimizes the costs while keeping conservative rate capabilities and the best possible time resolution. In particular, the RPC with its 1.5 ns time resolution is a good option for the barrel region, where its rate capability is an order of magnitude larger than the expected soft particle background. The TGC, that has been successfully tested up to rates of 100 KHz/cm\({}^{2}\), although with a slightly worse time resolution, is a good solution for the high rapidity region.

The exact value of rapidity where the transition between the two techniques occurs is not specified; this will be done once more accurate background calculations are available. However the compatibility between the two techniques makes this definition non-critical.

In Section 2 we will briefly recall the physics requirements on the muon trigger and summarize the present estimate of the expected background levels. In Section 3 we discuss the problem of bunch crossing identification. Section 4 describes the proposed trigger scheme. Sections 5 and 6 summarize the performances of the RPC and TGT respectively. Finally in Section 7 some preliminary indications on the hardware implementation of the trigger logic are given.

## 2 Physics requirements and background rates

### Physics requirements

The relevance of lepton identification on the physics discovery potential of LHC has been extensively discussed in the ATLAS LOI and milestone document [1, 2, 3]. In particular, lepton identification and measurement will allow to study:the standard model Higgs production in the mass window from 130 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) to 800 GeV/c\({}^{2}\).
* the precise measurement of top mass and the top spectroscopy.
* the CP violation in B-decays.

Also beyond the standard model, leptons are essential for new physics as, for example, the supersymmetric Higgs productions, extra gauge boson W' and Z', new particles and new interactions.

If we want to access this wide field of physics processes, the level 1 trigger system must be able to identify muons from very low \(\rm p_{T}\) (6 GeV/c, for B-physics) to high \(\rm p_{T}\) (40 GeV/c for heavy boson search). Moreover while a rapidity coverage up to \(\sim\) 2.5 is needed for Higgs physics at high luminosities (Table A), for B physics at lower luminosities a coverage up to 1.6 is sufficient [3]. In both cases multi-lepton triggers will require a very high and bias free single lepton trigger efficiency.

### Background rates

The estimation of the low energy neutral and charged particle background in the experimental hall is very important for designing a safe level-1 muon trigger system. Extensive M.C. simulation with FLUKA[4] and DTUJET[4] have been performed [5] in order to evaluate the expected fluxes. The main sources of background are:

* 10\({}^{6}\) Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) -10\({}^{2}\) Hz/cm\({}^{2}\)) to make the experiment impossible. With a plausible shielding the particle background fluence is reduced
by a factor of about 100. For a trigger chamber sensitivity of \(s_{n}=10^{-3}\) for neutrons and \(s_{\gamma}=10^{-2}\) for photons [5] the detector rate would range from 30 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) to 90 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) in the barrel and up to 500 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) for \(\eta\) close to 3. Soft muon rates of a few Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) in the barrel and a few tens of Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) in the forward region are expected. Hadron rates are about 10 times higher.
* secondary muons and hadrons from the p-p interactions leaking through the cracks present in the central calorimeter (those separating the central barrel calorimeter from the extended barrel calorimeter are by far the most dangerous), produce rates similar to the previous ones over a large surface around the cracks extension. Otherwise the calorimeter thickness (\(>\)10\(\lambda\)) is sufficient to keep the flux from punchtrough well below 1 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) up to \(\eta\) = 2 [6].
* Muons and hadrons due to the beam halo. The value is not yet well predicted. Machine constraint are such that a high beam halo would prevent the normal LHC operation mode [7]. For this reason the level of this background should be negligible in comparison to the ones discussed before.
* Muons produced by pion and kaon decays in the Atlas central cavity. The level of this background has been studied in great detail by several authors [6]; at the design luminosity the rate expected in the barrel is about 0.2 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\), whereas the rate in the endcaps reaches the value of 70 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) at \(\eta\) = 2.
* Cosmic rays background depends on the layout of the experimental hall and has not been studied with care. Preliminary estimates give a rate below 0.001 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\).
* Charged and neutral particles produced by radioactive materials present in the very forward regions, excited by the large particle flux at small angles. Depends on the detailed experiment layout and has not been yet studied in detail.

### Prompt muon rates

For transverse momentum thresholds of 10 GeV/c, direct muon production dominates over seconday muons generated by hadron decays and punchthrough. To estimate the rate, the main processes that have to be taken into account are:

* heavy-quark decays: \(pp\to c\overline{c}\), \(b\overline{b}\), \(t\overline{t}\)
* vector boson decays: \(pp\to\ W\), \(Z+X\)
* Drell-Yan pairs: \(pp\to\,\mu^{+}\mu^{+}+X\).

From M.C. simulation and using theoretical estimates of the production cross sections at LHC energy, the rate of muons with \(\rm p_{T}\) \(>\) 20 GeV/c at L = 1.7 10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{\mbox{-}2}\)s-1 in the full barrel (\(\rm\eta\)\(\rm I\) \(<\) 1) is about 1 kHz [8], mainly due to the beauty and charm semileptonic decays; dimuon rate is around 30 Hz. Muons with \(\rm p_{T}\) \(>\) 6 GeV/c are equally produced by heavy flavours and \(\pi\)-K decays; at L = 1.0x10\({}^{33}\) cm -2 s-1 the expected muon rate is about 10 kHz.

## 3 Bunch crossing identification

The LHC bunch crossing period of 25 ns is much smaller than the maximum drift time of the muon tracking detectors. To correctly reconstruct the muon trajectory there is need to know at which time \(\rm t_{o}\) the muon crossed the detectors, or, equivalently, the absolute time of the bunch crossing in which the muon was produced. Moreover the bunch crossing identification is essential to combine the muon with the other sub-detector triggers belonging to the same p-p crossing.\({}^{(*)}\)

The most natural and simple solution to this problem is to split the task of the muon spectrometer in two independent systems: a very fast one (\(<\)25 nsec) for the level-1 trigger and bunch crossing identification and the second for the precise muon momentum measurement. With such a solution, simple trigger schemes based on a coincidence logic can be adopted: moreover short coincidence times will strongly reduce the trigger rate induced by the background.

Alternatively, one can use the tracking drift chambers to derive also the level-l trigger toghether with the bunch crossing identification [9]. This solution is more complex from the electronic point of view and would imply a large coincidence time and, as a consequence, higher accidental rates. With a maximum drift time of 500 nsec, background occupancies of the order of 0.10 per drift cell are well possible and in this condition it is very difficult to conceive a simple and reliable level-l muon trigger and bunch crossing identification.

## 4 Level-l muon trigger

### Requirements

Summarizing the arguments discussed in previous sections, the following are the most important requirements for designing the level-l muon trigger of the Atlas detector:

1 safe operation in presence of high level of background and enough redundancy to keep the rate of accidental trigger well below the muon rate;

* The bunch crossing cannot be estimated by the second level trigger because this will require a too high DAQ bandwidthunique bunch crossing identification ;
* 3tunable and sharp pt-threshold over a large range of possible values: from \(\rm p_{T}^{th.}=6\) GeV/c to \(\rm p_{T}^{th.}=40\) GeV/c;
* 4possibility of vetoing very noisy regions;
* 5provision of the Region-Of-Interest (ROI) for the level-2 trigger (typical granularity required: \(\rm\Delta\eta\) x \(\rm\Delta\phi\) = 0.2 x 0.2); possibility of flagging the ROIs with \(\rm p_{T}^{th}=6\) GeV/c, for the second level muon trigger;
* 6short trigger latency: below 2 \(\rm\mu s\);
* 7synchronization of the system with an accuracy of a few ns over the whole area of the detector.

_4.2 The trigger principle_

The first level trigger concept is shown in fig. 1. After a given path inside the field the knowledge of the muon position and direction in the bending plane, with respect to the p-p interaction point, gives a measurement of the muon transverse momentum. If for the vertex position its nominal value is used, two points are sufficient to perform the momentum estimate. These two points are provided by two planes of chambers separated by a suitable lever arm. Strip read-out detectors with granularity at the centimeter level are adequate for the required \(\rm p_{T}\) thresholds while keeping the number of channels to an accetable level.

The muon spectrometer is divided in "trigger towers" with tipical size \(\rm\Delta\eta\) x \(\rm\Delta\phi\) = 0.2 x 0.2 to keep the signal propagation time along the strips below 10 ns. A tower can be seen also as a Region Of Interest. Each tower is a single trigger unit providing independent trigger information.

A tower is organized in two stations: in the barrel the first, S1, is placed inside the field region at a radius of 750 cm, whereas the second, S2, is placed outside the magnet at a radius of 1000 cm.

The first station is split in two substations \(\rm S1_{in}\) and \(\rm S1_{out}\) separated by a gap of about 40 cm. S1 is equipped with 4 single gap detectors, 2 in \(\rm S1_{in}\) and 2 in \(\rm S1_{out}\); S2 \(\rm\pm\) made with 3 single gap detectors. Globally, 7 plane of detectors are employed to keep the random coincidence rate, due to the high background level, well below the physical rate. Each detector layer is equipped with a two orthogonal coordinates read-out. In this way the trigger detector will provide at the same time an additional trigger condition in the non-bending plane and the second coordinate for the muon tracking. A position accuracy of a few cm is well matched with the magnetic field non-uniformity as function of the azimuthal angle.

For low-p\({}_{\rm T}\) trigger only the station S1 is used: each strip in S1\({}_{\rm in}\) opens a coincidence window in S1\({}_{\rm out}\). The size of the window in the bending projection determines the p\({}_{\rm T}\)-cut; the lever arm between the two sub-stations has been optimized for a window size of 20-30 cm at \(\eta\) = 0. The required majority of the coincidence is 3/4 ; in this way, for a 95% single detector efficiency, an overall trigger efficency of 98% can be obtained.

The trigger efficiency as a function of the muon transverse momentum is shown in fig. 2 for three coincidence window sizes; very sharp thresholds are easily achieved in the p\({}_{\rm T}\) range 5-10 GeV/c. The momentum resolution measurement is around 20% and it is limited mainly by the Coulomb scattering and by the fluctuations of the energy loss in the central calorimeter.

A similar approach can be used for the high-pt trigger; first a "pointing to the vertex" condition between S1\({}_{\rm in}\) and S1\({}_{\rm out}\) in both projections is requested. The hit pattern of Sl\({}_{\rm in}\) is then put in coincidence with the station S2; in this station a majority 2/3 in both projections is required providing an overall trigger efficiency \(\sim\)98%, for a 95% single detector efficiency. Again the coincidence window size defines the p\({}_{\rm T}\) threshold.

The transverse momentum resolution is about 30% and it is limited mainly by the fluctuation of the interaction point position (\(\sigma\) = 6 cm) and by the Coulomb scattering in the central calorimeter. Fig. 3 shows the trigger efficiency as a function of p\({}_{\rm T}\) for a window size of 9 strips at \(\eta\) = 0 optimized for a p\({}_{\rm T}\) threshold = 20 GeV/c.

A similar scheme based on two trigger stations outside the end cap magnet is at present under study for the forward region.

### Trigger rates

A detailed calculation of the trigger rate induced by incoherent and coherent background has been performed.

It is convenient to classify the background in two classes:

- incoherent background, that produces completely uncorrelated hits on the trigger chambers (mainly electron hits produced via Compton effect of neutron capture photons);

- coherent background, made of charged particles that can cross at least two adjacent trigger chambers, thus producing pattern of correlated hits.

At L = 1.7x1034 cm-2 s-1 the assumed average counting rate (for s\({}_{\rm T}\) = 0.01) is about 50 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) for incoherent phton-neutron background plus 15 Hz of soft charged particles. Fig. 4 shows the trigger rate expected in the whole barrel for the low-p\({}_{\rm T}\) trigger, as a function of the luminosity. At L = 1 x 1033 cm-2 s-1 the expected average background rate is about 4 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\). The corresponding low p\({}_{\rm T}\) trigger rate in the full barrel is below 1 kHz for the threshold p\({}_{\rm T}\) = 6 GeV/c. The expected rate from muons due to heavy flavour decays and pions/kaons in flight decays is of about 10 kHz.

For high p\({}_{\rm T}\)-threshold trigger the full system is used. The trigger rate induced by background is shown in fig. 5 as a function of the luminosity. The trigger rate for a threshold of 20 GeV/c at the luminosity L = 1.7 x 10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{\cdot}\)2 s\({}^{\cdot}\)l is about 20 Hz, to be compared with a trigger rate due to beauty and charm muons of about 4 kHz; the contribution of muons from hadron decays is expected to be lower than 500 Hz.

## 5 Properties of the Resistive Plate Chambers

The Resistive Plate Chambers, sketched in fig.6, is a gaseous parallel plate detector that combines the spacial resolution of the wire chambers with the time resolution typical of a scintillator counter. It is therefore particularly suitable for a fast space-time particle tracking as required by the Atlas muon trigger.

From the point of view of the construction a very actractive feature is the absence of wires that makes the production procedure very simple. An RPC is made by a pair of plates (usually bakelite) held together, parallel to one another, by a set of glued spacers. The outer surfaces of the plates are coated with graphite paint layers connected to the high voltage supplier. An insulating film is glued on the graphite with the purpose to shield external electrodes from high voltage.

The pick up strips are not embodied inside the detector. They are rather fixed on a film of a plastic material which is pressed against the detector surface on both sides. Two sets of orthogonal strips allow two dimensions read-out of the particle position.

The detector, filled with a gas mixture of Argon/Butane in the ratio 60/40 and a few per cent of freon, can be operated in streamer mode at a field intensity of about 4 KV/mm.

This "standard" operation mode has been widely studied both in accelerator and cosmic ray experiments [10]. The large size of the signals, 100 pC, makes the project and the realization of an adequate front-end electronics simpler.

On the other hand the large signal size also limits at about 100 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\)[11] the maximum rate at which an RPC can be efficiently operated. It has been pointed out in ref [12] that the rate capability can be improved by decreasing either the electrode resisitivity or the signal size, i.e. the gas amplification. A low gas amplification working mode with signals a factor of 100 smaller than in the standard mode is possible for RPCs provided a high front-end amplification is used to compensate for the lower gas amplification. A RPC operating with low gas amplification has been tested in RD5 [13]. It exhibited a gain of one order of magnitude in rate capability (see fig. 7) that is well adequete to cope with the background rate expected in the ATLAS hall. A further front end improvement would possibly result in a even better chamber performance.

The low gas amplification operating mode is characterized by the following features :

signal charge < 1 pC signal duration < 10 nssignal risetime < 3 ns rate capability \(\sim\) 1kHz/cm\({}^{2}\) time resolution 1.3 ns at 100 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) and 1.8 ns at 1kHz/cm\({}^{2}\) (single gas gap) Negligible increase of the delay with the counting rate (1 ns/kHz) Absence of non gaussian tails in the time distributions. spacial resolution \(\sim\)1 cm (limited by the strip size)

In a further test the same chamber was irradiated with intense sources of photons and neutrons with the purpose of simulating in a more realistic way the LHC working conditions in which the muon detector is exposed to a continuous and essentially uniform background interesting the full area. The performance of the chamber was monitored with cosmic muons defined by a scintillator telescope. The rate capability is shown in fig.8 where the detection efficiency is reported vs rate per unit surface induced by a photon source. This result confirms the one obtained at the RD5 test beam.

In this test the photon and neutron sensitivities have also be measured. The results are listed below:

Sensitivity for the photons of \({}^{137}\)Cs (0.66 MeV) 0.5% Sensitivity for the photons of the \({}^{60}\)Co (1.2-1.3 MeV) 1 % Sensitivity for the neutrons of the Americium-Berillium (about 4 MeV) \(\sim\)0.2 %

RPCs are currently produced in the industry. The existing mass production facility is adequate to cope with the ATLAS need. The estimated cost is 330 CHF/m\({}^{2}\) for the mechanics including supports and most of the manpower.

## 6 Properties of the Thin Gap Chambers

Thin-gap chambers operating in a saturated mode have been developed [14] by Israeli Institution for the use in the OPAL Pole-Tip Hadron Calorimeter [15] and Endcap Electromagnetic Presampler [16]. The devices were developed in 1983-1984 and a mass production facility was established in 1985. The detectors consist of 50 \(\upmu\)m wires spaced every 2 mm, sandwiched between two graphite cathode at a distance of 1.6 mm from the anode plane. Behind the graphite cathode planes there are strips or pads to perform a capacitive readout in any desired geometry. A description of the internal mechanical structure of the TGC is given in fig.9. The general characteristics of these detectors are summarized in the following.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]

Due to its operational characteristics in a saturated mode, thin gap chambers provide a timing signal with a small time jitter. A large (1.2 x 0.8 m\({}^{2}\)) chamber was scanned with a Ru source, where the trigger (start signal) was provided by an outside scintillator. The typical time jitter obtained shows an RMS of 5 ns and it is all contained within a 25 ns time interval. Distributions obtained at various points in the detector show the same characteristics. The maximal variation of the peak positions obtained was less than 3 ns, which is consistent with the expectations of the signal propagation along the length of the detector (1.2 m length).

Two such devices, staggered by 1/2 the wire spacing, have been exposed to muons in the ATLAS Muon Test Area. This arrangement eliminates the dead area due to wire support. It further improves the time resolution by more than it should be expected from the use of two consecutive chambers, leading to an RMS of 3.5 ns. The above time resolution values have been obtained with the so called "Standard Operating Gas", which is made of a mixture of 55% CO\({}_{2}\), 45% n-Pentane. Other mixtures have been tried that include 80% CF\({}_{4}\), 20% Iso-Butane, which lead to a better time resolution of 4 ns for a single layer and 2.7 ns for a two layer system; however the operating conditions for this type of gas need further investigation. As it can be seen from the above, TGC can provide a fully efficient trigger device for the ATLAS muon system, and in particular for the End Cap region with a large enough safety margin to cope with the high backgrounds expected.

## 7 Hardware implementation of the level 1 muon trigger

### The algorithm

For the implementation of the low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) trigger algorithm we propose a dedicated gate-array circuit whose prototype is under development in the RD27 collaboration [17].

When a muon hits the first detector layer, a signal of \(\sim\) 20 ns duration is generated and sent to the x input of the coincidence matrix circuit located on the second detector layer. The \(y\) input of the matrix receives a similar signal generated by the second layer. The two signals arrive at the input of the matrix almost simultaneously (the flight time of the muon through the apparatus partially compensates for the time taken to transmit the signal generated on the first layer to the second one). If there is a coincidence in the programmed matrix, a trigger signal is generated. The circuit operates on the four data patterns of S1, making the programmed coincidence and performing a 3/4 majority logic operation. Two \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) thresholds simultaneously can be programmed.

The implementation of the high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) trigger is done by a second gate-array circuit, identical to the one that performs the low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) trigger, but programmed in a different way, in order to perform the 2/3 majority logic operation.

A preliminary test of such a triggering scheme has been performed using the RD5 experimental set-up. In the test, the output of two planes of RPCs, separated by 2 m, are sent to a coincidence matrix implemented with very fast GaAs commercial components. The measured time resolution is well below the 25 ns LHC bunch-crossing period [18].

### 7.2 Bunch-crossing identification and system synchronisation

Every triggered muon must be assigned to an unique bunch-crossing number. This operation is performed by the synchronisation system that has to take into account two fundamental aspects: the distribution of the 10 MHz clock over a very large area, and the difference in time of flight of the particles through the apparatus (this difference can be of the same order of the bunch-crossing period).

For the synchronisation of the system we plan to make a logical subdivision of our apparatus into "zones", so that the propagation time of the signal from one zone to the next is equal to one bunch-crossing period. In this way, the most remote zone will be the last to receive the clock, the zone next to this will receive the clock one bunnch-crossing earlier and so on. The difference in propagation delays are compensated by introducing at the input of each zone an electronic delay of an integer number of bunch-crossing (see fig. 10). To compensate for different time of flight of the particles through the apparatus an additional delay is added to the clock entering each zone.

In addition we include a time interpolator for each zone, synchronous with the machine clock and running at four time the machine frequency. The value of the time interpolator for each trigger gives the exact time of arrival of the trigger pulse within the bunch-crossing. It is possible to correct "time in" the trigger system by analysing the time-interpolator data and by adjusting the programmable delays.

### 7.3 The Region of Interest

The trigger system contains information on the position of each muon, its \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) and the bunch-crossing from which is originated. This "Region of Interest" (ROI) information can be used by the level-2 trigger. In our design, the ROI corresponds to a region covered by a single coincidence matrix and its extension in \(\eta\) and \(\Phi\) will depend on the detector segmentation.

The ROI is the elementary unit of trigger processing and a total of \(\sim\) 400 ROIs will be generated. These will be arranged in groups of roughly - 64 to form about 8 "sectors" of trigger information. For each sector the trigger will give the number of triggered muons for every bunch-crossing, and their ROI information. The information coming from the different sectors is sent to the central muon processor that will generate the global muon trigger information that is passed to the level-1 central trigger processor.

## Conclusions

A combination of two techniques is proposed for the Dedicated Trigger System of the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer in a way that optimizes the costs while keeping conservative rate capabilities with the best possible time resolution.

The Resistive Plate Chambers are proposed as the detector element for the low rapidity region, based on their 1.5 ns, time resolution, combined with their lower cost. Thin Gap Chambers are proposed for the high rapidity region, where its high rate capabilities can cope with background rates that are expected to be as high as several KHz/cm\({}^{2}\). The two techniques are furthermore compatible in their readout characteristics.

The groups interested in the ATLAS Muon Trigger consider this combined solution as a good optimization to provide the best muon trigger performance combined with a reliable and unambiguous bunch crossing identification in the presence of high background levels.
