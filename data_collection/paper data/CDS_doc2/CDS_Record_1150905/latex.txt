###### Abstract

Test beam data taken in 1995 with a stack of 5 Tile Calorimeter prototype modules were reanalysed in order to compare the response to pions - in particular, the \(\pi/e\) ratio - to that of production modules tested in 2002. Attention was devoted to the following aspects: (1) electron/pion separation in electron runs; (2) response to electrons and its linearity, to establish the electromagnetic (EM) response scale; (3) selection of hadron runs with no electron contamination; (4) careful inspection of hadron data for spurious effects, and their correction; (5) cell intercalibration with a procedure that preserves the EM scale; (6) correction for the proton fraction in positive particle runs; (7) longitudinal and transverse leakage corrections.

The fully corrected \(\pi/e\) ratio is compared with the results from the 2002-2003 test beam data obtained with the production modules. We observe a 9.2% increase of \(\pi/e\) over the energy range of 20 to 300 GeV in the 1995 data vs. an increase of 6.3% with projective pions at 20\({}^{\circ}\) in the 2002-2003 test beam data.

Introduction

This study was motivated by inconsistencies between the hadron response of prototype and production modules of the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter (TileCal). The former were tested in 1993-1995 while the latter were tested in 2002-2003; the production module data were analyzed again by a TileCal task force in 2007 and 2008 [1]. In prototype modules, the observed variation of response to pions between 20 and 300 GeV is about 10% [2], whereas in production modules it is only about 6.3%. There are several differences in the hardware of prototype modules and production modules; the most relevant in this context is that production modules are about 1.5 \(\lambda_{t}\) (nuclear interaction lengths1) shorter. Data from the 1995 test beam period were analyzed in great detail in [3]. Part of these data are reanalysed here using techniques developed in the production module analysis, which lead to a further understanding of the hadron and electron responses.

Footnote 1: We take \(\lambda_{t}=20.55\) cm, calculated from Ref. [4].

This note begins with a brief description of the calorimeter and the test beam setup, followed by a section listing the available data sets and those that were analysed. In Section 4 we analyze electron data at 20\({}^{\circ}\) in order to precisely determine the electromagnetic (EM) energy scale. We define an electron/pion separation procedure similar to what was shown in Reference [1], and correct the response for sampling fraction variation with the usual sinusoidal shape.

In the analysis of hadron runs, several spurious effects were newly observed and corrected: an optical cross-talk, pedestal shifts and asymmetries in the cells between up and down PMTs. These effects as well as the corrective measures taken are described in Section 5.

A cell intercalibration procedure using muons incident at 90\({}^{\circ}\) was developed and applied, in a manner that preserves the previously established calibration of the EM scale as discussed in Section 6. The pion response is described in Section 7, with sequential application of the corrections for spurious effects previously described and the cell intercalibration procedure. In addition, to account for the proton component known to be present in the positive hadron beams, we used the TileCal results from later test beams to estimate the proton component and correct for it.

Finally, we compare the responses vs. energy to pions of prototype modules to the production module responses, applying longitudinal and transverse leakage corrections.

Detailed aspects of electron/pion separation, electron energy resolution, and certain signals in WLS fibers and PMT windows are described in three Appendices.

## 2 The prototype modules and test beam setup.

The prototype Tile Calorimeter studied here is composed of five modules vertically stacked, as shown in Fig.1. They are renumbered 1 to 5, from the bottom to the top. Each module spans \(2\pi/64\) in azimuthal angle, 1000 mm in the \(Z\) direction, 1800 mm in the \(X\) direction (almost 9 interaction lengths, \(\lambda_{t}\), or about 80 effective radiation lengths, \(X_{0}\)), and has a front face of 1000 \(\times\) 200 mm\({}^{2}\).

The absorber structure of each module consists of 57 repeated "periods", each of which spans 18 mm in \(Z\) and consists of 14 mm of iron and 3 mm of scintillator tile, the rest being wrappings and air. Along the \(X\) (longitudinal) coordinate, the calorimeter is segmented into 18 tile rows, each of 100 mm in depth.

The iron to scintillator ratio is \(4.67:1\) by volume.

Wavelength shifting fibers collect scintillation light from the tiles at both of their open (azimuthal) edges and bring it to photo-multipliers-tubes (PMTs) at the periphery of the calorimeter. The grouping of fibers to each PMT defines the readout cells. The modules are divided into five readout cells along \(Z\). They are also longitudinally segmented (along \(X\)) into four depth segments. The readout cells have lateral dimensions of about 200 mm along \(Z\), and longitudinal dimensions of 300, 400, 500, 600 mm for depth segments 1 to 4, corresponding to about 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 \(\lambda_{t}\) (see Fig. 2). In this note the depth segments are referred to as "samplings".

Figure 2: View from above of samplings, towers and cells in a prototype module. The red lines indicate the axis directions, the blue lines indicate the beam direction at \(+20^{\circ}\) and \(+90^{\circ}\).

The calorimeter was placed on a scanning table that allowed movement in any direction. Upstream of the calorimeter, a trigger counter telescope (S1 - S3) was installed, defining a beam spot approximately 20 mm in diameter. Two delay-line wire chambers (BC1, BC2), each with \((Z,Y)\) readout, allowed the impact point of beam particles on the calorimeter face to be reconstructed to better than \(\pm 1\) mm. "Muon wall" counters were placed behind and on the positive \(Z\) side of the calorimeter modules to measure longitudinal and lateral hadronic shower leakage.

## 3 The data

Pion and electron runs at 20\({}^{\circ}\) from perpendicular incidence, with energies ranging from 20 to 300 GeV, were analysed to study the hadron and electron responses. We also used muon runs2) at -90\({}^{\circ}\) and 150 GeV to check the optical cross-talk and to make a cell-to-cell intercalibration. In Table 1 we list the muon runs that were used and the numbers of events of each run, as well as the tile where the beam impacts and the corresponding module.

Footnote 2): The sign indicates impact on the positive or negative Z side

Table 2 lists the pion and electron runs that were analysed, with additional information on the beam polarity and date. There are three pion datasets, with large differences between them. The pion data taken in May 1995 suffer from large electron contamination, while no electron contamination was found in the July 1995 pion data. Hence we focus on the July data sets to determine the pion response. In the electron runs we did not find any particular problems aside from the usual hadron contamination, which is corrected with a method described in the next section.

In all of the analysed runs the same beam chamber cuts were applied. Tracks were required to be within a small angle to the beam axis (\(\pm\)0.2\({}^{\circ}\)) and within an impact circle of approximately \(R=10\) mm.

## 4 The electron response.

### Electron/hadron separation

The electron response was studied with 20, 50, 100 and 150 GeV data. The energy units used in this section are GeV, directly from the ntuples, and reflect an approximate electromagnetic energy scale. By analyzing the electron response vs. energy a more precise calibration of the electromagnetic scale was obtained.

Since the beam is a mixture of electrons, hadrons and muons, several event selection criteria were applied to obtain relatively pure electron samplings. To remove muons, the total energy was required to be \(>10\) GeV. For electron/hadron separation, two shower profile cuts in the calorimeter were used.

Electromagnetic showers deposit about most of their energy in the first sampling of the calorimeter [4]. For instance,about 90% of the energy of 20 GeV electrons is deposited in the first sampling. Virtually the entire electron signal at 20\({}^{\circ}\) is contained in four cells (C2, C3, C8, C9) of the three central modules. Adding up the signal from 12 rather than all 100 cells decreases the noise in the energy distribution and

Table 2: Pion and electron runs used in this analysis. To measure the pion response, we use the July 1995 pion data, where no electron contamination was found.

the signal contamination from the spurious effects described in Section 5.1.

The hadron and electron separation is delicate at the lower energies, 20 and 50 GeV. Separation is achieved using shower profile criteria that exploit the difference in longitudinal and transverse shower shape between electromagnetic and hadronic showers in the calorimeter.

The first shower profile cut uses the variable \(C_{tot}\), which measures the spread of the energy distribution among cells3). This quantity is defined in Reference [1] as:

Footnote 3): \(C_{tot}\) is similar to an RMS spread of the energy distribution among cells. When a shower is spread over only a few cells, as is the case for EM showers, we expect a larger value of \(C_{tot}\).

\[C_{tot}=\frac{1}{\sum\limits_{c}E_{c}^{\alpha}}\sqrt{\sum\limits_{c}\frac{ \left(E_{c}^{\alpha}-\sum\limits_{c}E_{c}^{\alpha}/N_{cell}\right)^{2}}{N_{ cell}}} \tag{1}\]

where \(E_{c}\) represents the energy in cell \(c\) and \(N_{cell}\) stands for the total number of cells considered4). The exponent \(\alpha\) is tuned using a Monte Carlo simulation, that indicates optimal separation for the value \(\alpha=0.6\)[1].

Footnote 4: Typically in production modules, \(3\times 3\) towers in \(\eta\times\phi\) are used for this cut giving \(N_{cell}=24\), 8 per module. In our analysis with prototype modules we sum 36 cells, 12 for each module.

The second cut uses \(f_{sum}\), the sum of the energies in the first and second cells where the beam impacts, as a fraction of the nominal beam energy. For electrons at \(20^{\circ}\) this quantity is defined as:

\[f_{sum}=\frac{EC2+EC8}{E_{nom}} \tag{2}\]

where EC2 and EC8 are the energies in cells C2 and C8 respectively (see Fig. 2).

In Fig. 3 one can see the distributions of \(f_{sum}\) (top) and \(C_{tot}\) (bottom) for an "electron" beam of 20 GeV. The peaks on the right correspond to electrons, while those on the left correspond to hadrons. The two structures overlap in broad ambiguous zones.

Figure 3: \(f_{sum}\) and \(C_{tot}\) distributions. The peaks on the right correspond to electrons, while the peaks on the left correspond to hadrons.

The separation is improved when the scatter plot of these two variables is considered. In Fig.4 and 5, \(f_{sum}\) is plotted against \(C_{tot}\) for pion and electron runs respectively. The comparison of the two contour plots shows that the pion runs contains a pure pion sampling, unlike the electron run. The same plots for the pions runs of July 1995 at all other energies show that there is no electron contamination.

In the electron run (Fig.5) the zone between the two lines labelled \(r_{e}\) and \(r_{pi}\) contains both electrons and pions.

We assume that below the line \(r_{pi}\) there are only pions; we call this zone I. Above the line \(r_{e}\) there are almost only electrons; we call this zone III. Between the lines \(r_{pi}\) and \(r_{e}\) there are both pions and electrons; we call this last zone the ambiguous zone or zone II. The events at \(f_{sum}\) below 0.2, and \(C_{tot}\) below 0.1 are due to pions that do not interact in the first two samplings.

In order to avoid biases we want to select all of the electrons. Specifically we produce an electron

Figure 5: Contour plot of \(f_{sum}\) vs. \(C_{tot}\) for a 20 GeV electron run.

sampling composed of events in the pure electron zone (III) plus selected events from the ambiguous zone (II). Then we correct for the residual pion contamination.

After identifying the three zones, we use more variables to tune the electron/hadron separation. Plotting the energy fraction in the second cell (\(EC8/E_{nom}\)) vs. the fraction in the first cell (\(EC2/E_{nom}\)) along the direction of incidence of the electron the separation of pions and electrons sharpers the separation. This allows us to estimate the pion contamination in the remaining electron samplings.

The procedure is illustrated in Appendix A, where the electron cuts are fully described and the remaining pion contamination is found to be 2.3% at 20 GeV and small enough to be neglected at 50, 100 and 150 GeV.

### Calculation of the electron response

The periodic variation of the response to electrons, reflecting the scintillator/iron structure of TileCal, is described and parameterized in appendix B. The electron response of the samples thus selected is given by the parameter \(p_{0}\) from the sinusoidal fit of equation 22 in Appendix B. In addition, at 20 GeV, we correct the electron response by taking into account the pion contamination of 2.3%. For this purpose we express the parameter \(p_{0}\) obtained from the sinusoidal fit as:

\[p_{0}=\frac{(N_{e}p_{0}^{cor}+N_{\pi}E_{\pi})}{(N_{e}+N_{\pi})} \tag{3}\]

where \(N_{e}\) and \(N_{\pi}\) are the numbers of electrons and pions given in Appendix A. The pion signal \(E_{\pi}=16.3\) GeV is the mean from a Gaussian fit of the energy spectrum of events in the area of ambiguous zone with \(0.05<EC2/E_{nom}<0.6\) also shown in App. A. From this formula we calculate the corrected electron response, \(p_{0}^{cor}\).

The contour plot of \(f_{sum}\) vs. \(C_{tot}\) for an electron run at 50 GeV in Fig. 6 shows a much lower population of ambiguous events than at 20 GeV. We estimate a hadron contamination of 0.4%. The contamination does not appreciably affect the calculation of the \(p_{0}\) parameter. Likewise, for \(E_{beam}>50\)GeV the hadron contamination is \(<0.1\%\), which we consider negligible.

Figure 6: Electron/hadron separation for a 50 GeV electron run. Contour plot of \(f_{sum}\) vs. \(C_{tot}\).

We also analysed one run at 300 GeV with the same angle of incidence but a different Z impact point (Z=-18.2 cm, instead -20 cm). We observed two different oscillation amplitudes, as shown in Fig.7. This indicates that the response of the calorimeter varies depending on which tile the beam impacts on due to differences in the individual tile/fibre response. For this reason we did not include the 300 GeV pion run in the electron response analysis.

### Electron linearity

Figure 8 shows the electron response \(R_{e}=p_{0}^{cor}/E_{nom}\) at the various beam energies, where \(p_{0}^{cor}\) is calculated as shown above. In the range between 20 and 100 GeV the electron response is constant within errors. The response at 150 GeV has a statistical error of 2% because of the scarcity of data at this energy.

The average electron response calculate from the results at 20 GeV, 50 GeV and 100 GeV is

\(0.915\pm 0.001(stat.)\). In order to obtain the electron energy in GeV the reconstructed signal must be multiplied by the factor \(1/R_{e}\).

The local variation of electron response due the variation of tile/fiber couplings dominates the error on the factor \(R_{e}\), which defines the electromagnetic scale. In this analysis we assume an EM scale error of \(\pm 2\%\).

## 5 Spurious effects in hadron data

Close inspection of hadron runs data showed a number of spurious effects, that had to be understood and corrected for before determining the hadron response. These effects and their removal are the subject of this section.

In this section, signals are expressed in the approximate electromagnetic energy scale of the uncorrected ntuples.

### The cross-talk effect

This effect was the first surprising feature seen in the hadron data of 1995. The clearest indication of the effect is the presence of significant signals in cells upstream of a large energy cluster and in the same tower of this cluster. Typically no signal is expected in such cells. For example, for pions interacting in the third sampling, correlated signals of up to 1 GeV were observed in cells upstream of the one in which the pion interaction took place, and in the same tower. This correlation between cells at a distance of about 80 cm cannot be due to physical processes such as backscattering.

We attribute this effect to optical cross-talk, which is likely due to incomplete Mylar coverage of the WLS fibers coupled to a tile with a light signal in it. As a result some light propagates to fibers (belonging to other radial samplings in the given tower) that pass in the immediate vicinity of the tile with a light signal (see Fig. 9). The effect is not observed in production modules because fibers are inserted into opaque profiles, which fully shield them from the light produced in the tiles over which the fibers run before reaching the PMTs.

Figure 9: Optical cross-talk: the photograph shows that a luminized Mylar does not quite reach the ends of the tile readout edge. The light coming out of a tile (_e.g._ S4) can be absorbed in any of the three fibers running in the vicinity.

Energy deposited in the first sampling does not produce cross talk because no fibres from other sampling pass in the vicinity of its tiles. On the contrary, the effect is maximal when there is energy deposition in the last sampling, because light leaking out may pass into fibers from all three other samplings. In this case there is a correlation between signals in the fourth sampling and the others.

We investigate the cross-talk effect with two data sets. We use muons at 90\({}^{\circ}\) to confirm the existence of cross-talk and to exclude the possibility that it may be light directly produced by particles hitting fibers rather than the effect just described. Then we analyse projective pion beam data at various energies to quantify the effect.

#### 5.1.1 Cross-talk tests with 90\({}^{\circ}\) muons

The large spread of the hadronic showers makes it difficult to determine whether the observed spurious signals originate from a "light leak" as described or from particles hitting fibers. Therefore we study 90\({}^{\circ}\) muons because occasional electromagnetic showers are well-contained in the sampling traversed by the beam, allowing us to separate direct and cross-talk signal components.

An example of average energy deposition of muons at 90\({}^{\circ}\) is shown in Fig. 10. In this figure we see the lego plot of the energy deposited in each cell. The muon beam hits tile 15, in the middle of the fourth sampling, and deposits about 0.3 GeV in each cell.

From preliminary checks we expect a cross-talk fraction of about 1%, so for typical muon energy depositions the signal will be a few MeV, compatible with pedestal variation. Therefore one must apply cuts to select events with a large EM shower. As usual, we impose first a geometrical cut requiring tracks at a small angle and within a small impact circle. Then we require events with more than 10 GeV in a cell.

Figure 10: Lego plot of cell energy. Muons impinge on tile 15, at -90\({}^{\circ}\).

In Fig. 11 one can see the correlation between signals in cells of the same tower. The beam impacts tile 9 in cell C11 and for the events plotted here there are \(>\) 10 GeV in cell 13.

In the top right plot one sees the correlation between the energy in the first sampling, cell 3 vs. the third sampling, cell 13. The slope of the linear fit (0.60%) is the cross-talk fraction5). In the bottom left plot one sees the signal of cell 8 vs. that of cell 13, with a cross-talk fraction of 0.66%. In the bottom right plot there is no visible correlation between the energy depositions in cell 18 and in cell 13. This is expected, because the fibers from the fourth sampling do not pass over the tiles of the third sampling.

Footnote 5: The linear fit was performed without assigning errors.

These studies were performed for several tower-cell combinations, and prove the existence of a cross-talk effect via the optical fibers. However, the results do not discriminate between the hypotheses of optical cross-talk from light leaking out of the aluminum Mylar or light directly produced in fibers. We refer to the latter scenario as "particle" cross-talk.

We tried to separate the two effects using muons at -90\({}^{\circ}\) that hit a tile near its edge. As usual, the muon impact point was measured with beam chambers.

We look for a signal in module 4 when a muon EM shower produces a signal of more than 10 GeV in module 3. The bottom fibers of module 4 are only a few mm away from the fibers of module 3. Hence a particle signal in module 3 should be seen in module 4 too, while direct light transfer will be blocked by the black paper shielding between modules.

In Fig. 12 we present the scatter plots of two bottom PMTs of module 4 vs. cell 13 of module 3.

Figure 11: 150 GeV muon beam impacting tile 9 in C11 at -90\({}^{\circ}\). Correlation of signals in cells of the same tower.

The lego plots on the left show the signals in module 4 (top) and module 3 (bottom). The scatter plots on the right show the signals in the bottom PMTs of module 4 vs. the signal in cell 13 of module 3. No correlation is observed.

A further test to find the origin of the cross-talk was performed. We selected a -90\({}^{\circ}\) muon run in which the beam hits a tile of sampling 4 only 2 cm from the top edge of the tile.

The correlation of signals of bottom PMTs of different cells can only be due to optical cross-talk, because the fibres are far from the area where the energy is deposited. Conversely, the correlation of signals from top PMTs may be partially due to direct particle signal because the fibres are near to the energy deposition area. To increase the statistics we sum over towers.

The result for the bottom PMTs is shown in Fig. 13. The plot shows the correlation of the bottom PMTs of sampling 1 vs. the bottom PMTs of sampling 4. The cross-talk factor is 0.61%, as expected from the light leak effect. The average of all of the samplings is 0.7%. This value is very close to the factor obtained with the beam impact at Y=0 in the middle of the tile (0.67%).

Figure 12: Left: lego plots of the mean signals of module 4 (top) and module 3 (bottom). Right: scatter plots of two bottom PMTs of module 4 (cells 13 and 8) vs. the sum of the PMT signals in cell 13 of module 3.

The result of this test for the top PMTs is shown in Fig. 14. The plot shows the correlation of the top PMTs of sampling 4 vs. the top PMTs of sampling 1. We find a larger cross-talk fraction of 1.7%, indicating a possible contribution from particle cross-talk; however the fit may be biased by the two points with large signals. It must also be noted that the optical cross-talk is expected to be larger for this beam impact point because the light is produced near the fibres.

We conclude that the existence of optical cross-talk is proved, but the presence of some direct particle signal in the fibers cannot be ruled out by these tests. In Appendix C we demonstrate that the direct fiber signals are small (at least at 90\({}^{\circ}\)) and are not an important contribution to the observed optical cross-talk.

Figure 13: Correlation between bottom PMTs of sampling 1 and sampling 4.

#### 5.1.2 Cross-talk correction method

With pions, the particle signal could be more important, because more particles may traverse the fibers. For this reason we use pion runs in projective geometry to quantify the cross-talk effect.

The effect was investigated at several beam energies: 20, 100, and 300 GeV. Whenever possible, we calculate separately the cross-talk from each cell.

As discussed in Section 5.1, the cross-talk from a given cell only affects cells in the same tower. Using data at positive and negative 20\({}^{\circ}\) incidence, we measure the correlation between the cells where the hadron shower signals are large and the remaining cells of the same towers.

In the table of Fig. 15 we summarize the cross-talk factor in % for different energies and cells, in particular for the green cells outlined on the left in Fig. 15. We remark that in the tower containing cells C1 to C16 the correlation between the cells is weak or non-existent. The reason is not understood; possibly the fibres in this tower are better covered by Mylar strips.

We obtain a mean cross-talk fraction 0.68% with an error on the mean of 0.02%. This mean value is taken to apply to every cell.

The correction is applied to each cell by subtracting the calculated cross-talk signal due to cells in the same tower. For example, the corrected energy in cell 5, \(EC_{5}^{corr}\) is:

\[EC_{5}^{corr}=EC_{5}-\alpha\cdot EC_{10}-\alpha\cdot EC_{15}-\alpha\cdot EC_{20} \tag{4}\]

where \(\alpha\) is the cross talk fraction (0.68%) and \(EC_{10}\), \(EC_{15}\) and \(EC_{20}\) are the cell signals in the same tower and in different samplings.

Figure 15: The left part of the figure illustrates how it is possible to calculate the cross-talk correction in cells with beams at \(\pm 20^{o}\) (shown in green). In the table the percent cross-talk into these cells at different energies are summarized.

The electromagnetic showers deposit most of their energy in the first sampling, which produces no cross-talk. Therefore we do not correct electron signal summed over the first two cells for cross-talk.

The cross-talk signal increases with energy with an approximately linear dependence. In Fig. 16 the mean cross-talk correction vs. beam energy is shown. The correction is close nearly linear as a function of beam energy but it goes above the proportionality line at high energy. This is because the fraction of hadron energy in the samplings further downstream increases with the energy.

### Pedestal shift

Looking at the correlation between cells due to optical cross-talk, another type of effect became apparent: noise in all readout channels, associated with large energy deposits in one. In the plots of Fig. 17 we see the energy distributions of PMTs 31 (left) and 32 (right) of cell 16 for a pion beam of 300 GeV at +20\({}^{0}\). Cell 16 is far from the beam, so the signal distribution should be that of the pedestal. We expect a value centred at zero because in the ntuples the pedestal is already subtracted. Instead, it is seen that the distributions shift to negative values when there are large energy deposits in the modules. The two channels of cell 16 shift by about -150 MeV and -68 MeV. No optical cross-talk is expected in this case.

Figure 16: The total mean cross-talk correction vs. beam energy.

Figure 17: Distributions of PMTs 31 and 32 of cell 16 for a 300 GeV pion run at +20\({}^{o}\).

It can be seen in Fig. 18 that the pedestal shift scales linearly with beam energy and is about the same in all cells. The figure is obtained with 20\({}^{\circ}\) pions plotting the signals in cells far from the beam. The mean value of the pedestal shift for three cells as a function of energy is shown. We require no interactions in the first two samplings, to eliminate direct shower signals in cells 17, 16 and 11.

To correct for this effect we estimate the pedestal shift from cells far from the beam. We assume that every cell is equally affected, and apply an average correction.

The total estimated pedestal shift is shown as a function of beam energy in Fig. 19. It is linear to within 0.5% with an estimated error of 0.2%.

Figure 19: The total estimated pedestal shift vs. beam energy.

Figure 18: The pedestal shift for three cells as a function of the beam energy. The pedestal shift is seen to be approximately linear with beam energy.

In addition, in Fig. 20 is shown the RMS of the pedestal shifts in cells C1, C6, C11, C16 and C17 vs. \(1/\sqrt{E_{beam}}\). We observe that the ratio of the RMS to the beam energy scales like \(1/\sqrt{E_{beam}}\). This scaling confirms that the pedestal shift is proportional to the signal in the modules.

In conclusion, we found that the pedestal associated with the readout electronics is shifted towards negative values in the presence of beam. In our analysis we correct for this effect. The correction is applied only to hadron runs. For electrons the effect is neglected because only four cells are summed.

It is worth noting that the crosstalk and the pedestal shift produce opposite and roughly equal effects on the \(total\) hadron signal, and that they have roughly the same energy dependence. Hence the combined crosstalk and pedestal shift effects are much smaller than either.

### Asymmetries in the response of top and bottom PMTs in the central module.

We systematically searched for asymmetries in the response of the two PMTs reading out each cell of the central Module 3, because such effects were observed in test beam runs of production modules. The search was first conducted using the variable:

\[(Up-Down)/(Up+Down) \tag{5}\]

the difference of PMT energies divided by their sum.

Figure 20: Resolution plot for pedestal shift. Shown is the sum of cells C1, C6, C11, C16 and C17 as a function of \(1/\sqrt{E_{beam}}\).

The only significant asymmetry was found to occur in cell 9, and only in 300 GeV data. The left plot of Figure 21 shows the distribution defined above for cell 9. On the right is shown the scatter plot of (5) as a function of the sum of two PMT signals. It is seen that the signal of the upper PMT is higher than that of the lower PMT.

The latter plot suggests that this asymmetry is due to a pedestal shift of one of the two PMTs. This is confirmed in Fig. 22, where the signal of the top PMT is plotted against the one from the bottom PMT. It is seen that the latter is shifted to negative values that reach -0.4 GeV, whereas the top PMT signal does not extend beyond zero, as normally expected.

We do not observe asymmetries in any other cell at any energy. The contribution of the asymmetry in cell 9 to the total mean energy at 300 GeV is only 0.16%, small enough to warrant neglecting it.

Figure 21: Asymmetry of the PMT signals in cell 9 of module 3 at 300 GeV. Distribution of the variable defined in formula (5) in the left plot, and scatter plot of the same quantity vs. the sum of two PMTs in the right plot.

Figure 22: Scatter plot of the upper vs. lower PMT signals in cell 9 at 300 GeV.

### Asymmetry in the response of modules above and below the central module

For beams impacting Module 3 at Y = 0 (see Fig. 1) the mean response of cells symmetrically placed with respect to the Y = 0 plane is expected to be equal. This symmetry was systematically checked, and it was found that in a few cells of module 4 the pedestals shift to negative values when energy deposition in the central module is large. This effect appears to be the same type of pedestal shift observed in Module 3 and illustrated in Section 5.2. In Fig. 23 one can see an example of this effect. In the scatter plot of cell 3 of Module 4 vs. cell 3 of Module 2, the signal in Module 4 extends to negative values, while this is not case for Module 2.

To quantify this effect we compared the total energy response of the two modules. Figure 24 shows the response as a function of the beam energy for modules 2 and 4. The response of module 4 (blue circles) is less than that of module 2 (green squares) because it is affected by negative pedestal shifts. The difference is about 15% of the total energy in each module or 1 GeV at 300 GeV and is roughly proportional to energy. The effect is 0.4% of the total reconstructed energy as defined below in section 7. This effect was corrected for.

Figure 24: Mean response of modules 2 and 4 vs. beam energy.

Figure 23: Scatter plot of cell 3 of module 4 vs. cell 3 of module 2 showing an asymmetry. The cell 3 response of module 4 is lower than that of module 2.

## 6 Cell intercalibration with muons at 90\({}^{\circ}\).

During the 1995 test beam period the response of individual PMT was equalized with a wire-driven Cs\({}^{137}\) source. The results could not be retrieved at the time of this reanalysis, therefore the cell responses were intercalibrated using muons at 90\({}^{\circ}\).

In this section two different cell intercalibration methods are illustrated; both are designed to preserve the electromagnetic scale.

Only the response of the cells in the central module is intercalibrated here. Signals from muons incident at 90\({}^{\circ}\) on each of the 18 tile rows defined in Section 2. These data were taken just a few days before the pion data analyzed further in this Note.

The response of each tile-row is defined to be the truncated mean of the muon signal between 0 and 1 GeV. The muon response for each cell is the average of the response of all tile rows in that cell. We call it \(W_{st}\) where \(s\)=1,..4 is the sampling number and \(t\)=1,..5 is the tower number.

As an example, the muon energy distribution in two different cells is shown in Figure 25.

Figure 25: Muon energy distribution in two different cells. Left plot: muon energy distribution in cell 1, where the beam impacts in tile-row 1. Right plot: the same for cell 8, where the beam impacts in tile-row 7.

Figure 26 shows the mean signal of cells in the same sampling as a function of tile-row number for three different towers 3,4 and 5. We see systematic variations in each sampling, clearly correlated with the tile position. These variations are qualitatively understood; similar variations also appear in the production modules.

### First cell intercalibration method.

The weights \(C_{st}\) are calculated for each sampling (\(s\) = 1,..4) and each tower (\(t\) = 1,..5). \(C_{st}\) is the ratio between the muon response in tower \(t\) of the first sampling and the muon response in the same tower in sampling \(s\):

\[C_{st}=W_{1t}/W_{st} \tag{6}\]

where \(W_{st}\) is the muon signal in the cell \(st\).

Thus by definition \(C_{1t}=1,forall\ t\). The weights of the cells in the first radial sampling are set equal to 1 because most of the electromagnetic shower is contained there. This procedure approximately preserves the electromagnetic scale calculated previously.

The energy of each cell \(E_{st}\) is re-scaled by the factor \(C_{st}\) according to

\[E_{st}^{I}=C_{st}\cdot E_{st} \tag{7}\]

Figure 26: The mean signal of the cell in each sampling for towers 3,4 and 5 vs. the number of the tile-row.

Figure 27 shows the weights for each tower as a function of the samplings. We observe a similar trend in all towers, except for tower 2.

### Second cell intercalibration method.

The cell intercalibration method just described can be refined in order to more accurately preserve the electromagnetic scale, thereby resulting in a more accurate \(\pi/e\) ratio. For this purpose, in the second method the mean longitudinal profile of the electron shower in the first few tile-rows is taken into account.

The mean longitudinal profile of energy deposition in an electromagnetic cascade is described by a gamma distribution, as proposed by Longo and Sestili a long time ago [4]. The longitudinal profile is described by:

\[\frac{dE}{dx}=E_{0}\cdot b\frac{(bt)^{a-1}e^{-bt}}{\Gamma(a)} \tag{8}\]

where \(t=x/X_{0}\) is the depth in radiation lengths6). The maximum occurs at \(t_{max}=(a-1)/b\) and depends linearly on the logarithm of the energy :

Footnote 6: In this analysis we use the radiation length \(X_{0}=2.23cm\) calculated from the fractions of the materials used in the prototype modules and their nuclear radiation lengths.

\[t_{max}=\frac{a-1}{b}=ln\frac{E}{E_{c}}+\begin{smallmatrix}-0.5&for~{}electrons \\ 0.5&for~{}\gamma\end{smallmatrix} \tag{9}\]

where \(E_{c}\) is the critical energy 7). The scale factor is \(b\approx 0.5\) for electrons incident upon iron. From equation (9) one may calculate the parameter \(a\) at different energies. Here, we only considered the electromagnetic shower profile for an electron beam of 77 GeV, the geometric mean of the highest and lowest energies, 20 and 300 GeV.

Footnote 7: In this analysis we estimate the critical energy to be \(E_{c}=30MeV\).

Figure 27: Weights as a function of the sampling for each tower.

Figure 28 shows the fractional energy deposition per cm for 77 GeV electrons incident at 20\({}^{\circ}\). The vertical lines correspond to the boundaries tile-rows for particles at 20\({}^{\circ}\). In Table 3 the energy fractions in the first six tile-rows are given. About 87% of the energy of the EM shower is deposited in the first sampling by an electron beam at 77 GeV.

The weights are recalculated on the basis of the fraction of the electron signal in each of the first five tile-rows. We define the weight \(W_{f}\) as the mean of the muon signals in each of the three tile-rows of cell C2, for the first sampling and of the first two tile-rows of cell C8, weighted by the fraction of the energy of 77 GeV electrons deposited in each tile-row. These two cells contain almost the entire electron signal, as mentioned in Section 4.1. The new weight \(W_{f}\) is:

\[W_{f}=\sum_{i=1}^{5}f_{i}\cdot<E_{i}> \tag{10}\]

where \(f_{i}\) is the energy fraction for tilerow \(i\) given in Table 3 and \(<E_{i}>\) is the muon mean energy in tilerow \(i\) of cells C2, or cells C8. Then we define the weights \(C_{st}\) as

\end{table}
Table 3: The energy fraction in the first six tile-rows. The first five energy fractions are the weights applied to the muon responses in the corresponding tile-rows.

\[C_{st}=W_{f}/W_{st} \tag{11}\]

where \(W_{st}\) is the muon signal in the cell \(st\). The intercalibrated cell energy is :

\[E_{st}^{I}=C_{st}\cdot E_{st} \tag{12}\]

where \(E_{st}\) is the energy in the cell \(st\).

## 7 The hadron response.

In this section the energy scale considerations and the corrections illustrated in the previous sections are brought into play to obtain the response of the 1995 prototype setup to pions. The conversion factor measured with electron beams, \(R_{e}=0.915\pm 0.001(stat.)\), is applied; thus the pion responses obtained are the \(\pi/e\) response ratios. No correction for calorimeter non-compensation has been applied.

In this analysis the total hadron energy is defined as the mean of sum of the signals of the three central modules obtained by fitting the distribution with a Gaussian over \(\pm 2\sigma\). The energy sums are over only three of the five prototype modules were considered in order to compare to the setup for the production modules, which involved only three modules.

### Corrections to the hadron response.

Figure 29 shows the effect of the different corrections applied on the ratio \(\pi/e\) as a function of the logarithm of the beam energy.

The violet squares represent the raw data without any correction. The blue circles are the response when we correct for the pedestal shifts of modules 3 and 4 as discussed in

Figure 29: The \(\pi/e\) ratio as a function of beam energy with several sets of corrections and cell intercalibration applied.

effect of the addition of the cross-talk correction is shown by the red triangles on the plot. The combined effect of these corrections is minor at all energies. From 20 GeV to 300 GeV, the \(\pi/e\) ratio increases by 0.083, a relative change of 10% with respect to its value at 20 GeV.

In the figure one can also see the effect of the cell intercalibration with muons at 90\({}^{\circ}\) with the first method (black triangles, pointing down). As a result of this procedure the pion response systematically decreases by \(\sim 2\%\). The variation of the \(\pi/e\) ratio between 20 and 300 GeV is only slightly affected by the cell intercalibration after which this variation is 0.074, a relative change of 9.1%.

The two cell intercalibration procedures discussed in the previous section produce an appreciable scale shift in the \(\pi/e\) ratio. The comparison is given in Fig. 30, after applying all other corrections. The red dots represent the \(\pi/e\) ratio using the first method, as already shown in the previous \(\pi/e\) plot (Fig.29). The black dots show the \(\pi/e\) ratio using the second method.

With the second method the \(\pi/e\) ratio increases by 0.01-0.02 over the entire energy range, and its energy dependence is appreciably enhanced. The variation of the \(\pi/e\) ratio between 20 and 300 GeV is now 0.081, a relative change of 9.9%.

Next, we briefly discuss the errors on the \(\pi/e\) ratios, distinguishing between the point-to-point error and the scale error. The error bars on the previous plots only represent the point-to-point errors. They include statistical errors and the contributions from each type of correction. The scale error includes the electromagnetic scale error, which is about 2% when comparing results in different cells or modules, and 1.2%, added in quadrature, from the cell intercalibration uncertainty. Altogether, the scale error is about 2.3%, or about 0.02 on the \(\pi/e\) ratio.

Figure 30: The \(\pi/e\) ratio with the two different cell intercalibration methods described in Section 6.

The energy resolution in the range from 20 to 300 GeV is obtained as follows. The Gaussian \(\sigma\) is obtained from a fit as described in the previous subsection. Fig. 31 shows the ratio \(\sigma/E\), where \(E\) is the mean energy from the fit, as a function of \(1/\sqrt{E_{beam}}\). The error bars correspond to statistical errors only.

Again the different markers correspond to the different corrections for spurious effects or to the cell intercalibration. These do not affect the resolution.

Fig. 32 shows the comparison between the resolution of prototype modules and that of the production modules tested in the 2002-2003 periods [1] at \(\eta=0.35\) (\(\theta=19.6^{\circ}\)).

Figure 31: Resolution of the hadronic response.

Figure 32: Resolution of the hadronic response for the prototype modules (red triangles) and production modules (black circles).

The energy dependance is fitted with the expression applied in Ref. [1]:

\[\sigma/E=a/\sqrt{E}\oplus b, \tag{13}\]

where \(E\) is the energy in GeV, the stochastic term \(a\) reflects statistical fluctuations in the shower development and \(b\), the constant term, reflects the effects of miscalibration, leakage, etc. The result is \(\sigma/E=(57.2\pm 1.0)\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus(3.7\pm 0.2)\%\). The constant term is significantly lower than for production modules, where \(\sigma/E=(52.7\pm 0.9)\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus(5.7\pm 0.2)\%\). This is not a surprising result, considering that the 1995 prototype modules, being 30 cm (\(\sim 1.5\lambda_{t}\)) longer at \(20^{\circ}\), have considerably less longitudinal leakage than the production modules. The statistical term in the production modules is largely determined by the resolution at 10 GeV, a data point not available for the prototype modules. This appears to be the reason for the difference in the stochastic term of the two fits.

### From the hadron response to the pion response

In the H8 beam line, the hadron beams with a positive charge as known to be a mixture of pions and protons. The response of the Tile Calorimeter to protons is known to be less than the response to pions by a few percent [1] and needs to be corrected for8). However in the 1995 test beam no hadron identification was used, therefore the proton contamination in the hadron data must be corrected for based on indirect information.

Footnote 8: In the prototype paper [2] the proton fraction contamination was never taken in account.

In Table 2 of Section 3 the polarity of the beam particles in the analysed runs was shown. The beam at 50, 100 and 180 GeV is positive (\(\pi^{+}\)) and at 20 and 300 GeV it is negative (\(\pi^{-}\)). The anti-proton contamination in \(\pi^{-}\) beam is negligible, therefore we only need to correct for the proton fraction at 50, 100 and 180 GeV. The proton fraction in the 1995 test beams was assumed to be what was measured in the same test beam in 2002, where accurate particle identification procedures were applied [5]. A conservative estimate of a relative \(\pm\)50% error on the proton fraction \(f_{p}\) was made.

Table 4 shows the proton fraction assumed in correcting the hadron response at 50, 100 and 180 GeV.

The correction was done using the following expression for the measured hadron energy \(E_{had}\):

\[<E_{had}>=f_{p}<E_{p}>+f_{\pi}<E_{\pi}> \tag{14}\]

where \(f_{p}\) and \(f_{\pi}\) are the proton and pion fractions of the beam and \(<E_{p}>\) and \(<E_{\pi}>\) are the reponses to pure proton and pion beam energy respectively. Using \(f_{p}+f_{\pi}=1\) and the ratios of the measured

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline Energy (GeV) & \(\mathbf{f_{p}\pm\Delta f_{p}(\Delta f_{p}=f_{p}/2)}\) \\ \hline
**50** & **0.364\(\pm\)0.182** \\ \hline
**100** & **0.637\(\pm\)0.319** \\ \hline
**180** & **0.531\(\pm\)0.266** \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: The proton fraction \(f_{p}\) at different energies 50, 100, 180 GeV.

responses for pions and protons \(X=<E_{p}>/<E_{\pi}>\) from [5], we obtain the pion response corrected for the proton contamination:

\[<E_{\pi}>=\frac{<E_{had}>}{f_{\pi}+Xf_{p}} \tag{15}\]

Table 5 shows the corrections applied to the measured total hadron signals to obtain the pion responses for the different beam energies, as well as the uncertainty on the corrections.

In Figure 33 one can see the \(\pi/e\) ratio as a function of the logarithm of the beam energy before and after applying the proton fraction correction. The black points represent the \(\pi/e\) ratio after applying all corrections as well as the second cell intercalibration method. The red points include the proton fraction correction at 50, 100 and 180 GeV. This correction significantly increases the \(\pi/e\) values at these three energies. As a result the overall response is remarkably linear with the logarithm of beam energy. The yellow band in the figure represents the overall scale uncertainty of \(\pm\)0.02, which includes the uncertainty on the electromagnetic response and the cell intercalibration error.

### Transverse leakage measurement

The transverse leakage of a three-module stack was estimated assuming total transverse containment in the five modules of the 1995 setup.

Figure 34 shows the relative transverse leakage as a function of the logarithm of the beam energy from 20 to 300 GeV.

In this energy range, transverse leakage decreases approximately linearly with the logarithm of the beam energy. It is about 1.6% at 20 GeV and 0.45% at 300 GeV.

### Leakage corrections

In order to compare the results of this reanalysis of 1995 data to those obtained with production modules the pion response is corrected for the longitudinal and lateral leakage as was done for production modules.

In Table 6 one can see the \(\pi/e\) ratio for 1995 data and the leakage corrections in %. We assume statistical errors for the response from single measurements in 1995 data. In the energy range between 50 to 180 GeV the statistical error is added in quadrature to the error from proton fraction correction, which dominates. The longitudinal leakage corrections come from results in the 90\({}^{\circ}\) configuration [5]. In this configuration a module is effectively "infinitely" long since there is no longitudinal leakage. The transversal leakage corrections come from prototype modules (Fig. 34)

Figure 34: Relative transverse leakage as a function of the beam energy.

In Figure 35 one can see the \(\pi/e\) ratio as a function of the logarithm of the beam energy after applying the longitudinal and lateral leakage corrections.

The results in Fig. 35 can be fit to the usual expression for \(\pi/e\) as a function of the \(e/h\) ratio:

\[\frac{\pi}{e}=\frac{1}{\frac{e}{h}}[1+f_{\pi^{0}}(e/h-1)] \tag{16}\]

where \(f_{\pi^{0}}\) is the electromagnetic energy fraction. We use two different parametrizations for the electromagnetic energy fraction. In the Groom parametrization:

\[f_{\pi^{0}}=1-(E/E_{0})^{(m-1)} \tag{17}\]

where we fix \(E_{0}=1\) GeV and \(m\) and \(e/h\) are the free parameters. The fit to the responses (blue line) returns \(e/h=1.49\pm 0.03\) and \(m=0.78\pm 0.01\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline \(\pi/e\)(GeV) & \(\pi/e\)(GeV) & \(\pi/e\)(GeV) & \(\pi/e\)(GeV) \\ \hline
**20** & \(0.813\pm 0.003\) & \(0.5\) & \(1.6\) \\
**50** & \(0.840\pm 0.007\) & \(0.6\) & \(1.1\) \\
**100** & \(0.862\pm 0.006\) & \(0.7\) & \(0.8\) \\
**180** & \(0.877\pm 0.007\) & \(0.9\) & \(0.6\) \\
**300** & \(0.893\pm 0.002\) & \(1.0\) & \(0.4\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

In the Wigmans parametrization:

\[f_{\pi^{0}}=0.11\times ln(E[GeV]) \tag{18}\]

the only free parameter is \(e/h\). The fit returns \(e/h=1.34\pm 0.01\). The results of this analysis are compatible with both parametrizations. They are also compatible with previous results on \(e/h\)[2].

## 8 Comparison to responses of production modules at \(\eta=0.35\).

In the 2002-2003 test beam period production modules were tested with hadron beams at \(\eta=0.35\) (corresponding to \(\theta=19.6^{\circ}\)).

The results on pion response are given in [1] with longitudinal and transverse leakage corrections. They are shown in Fig. 36, compared to the results of the 1995 prototype analysis.

The red points correspond to the prototype modules and the blue triangles correspond to the production modules at \(20^{\circ}\).

The parametrization of the production module responses given in [1] using Groom's formula gives \(e/h=1.33\pm 0.06\) and \(m=0.85\pm 0.03\). This parametrization is used to compare the variation of the response with energy of the prototype and production modules.

Over the energy range from 20 to 300 GeV the relative change of the pion response is 9.2% for 1995 data and 6.3% for 2002-2003 data with errors of roughly 1% on each number.

The slopes of the two sets of responses appear to differ, however the significance of this difference is hard to estimate. A priori, it is not surprising that such a difference should be encountered, considering the changes in calorimetry hardware between the prototype and production modules.

Figure 36: Comparison between \(\pi/e\) responses in 2002-2003 production modules at \(20^{\circ}\) and \(\pi/e\) in 1995 prototype modules at \(20^{\circ}\) with all leakage corrections.

Summary and conclusions

The main goal of this reanalysis of the 1995 data was to obtain the response as a function of energy of the 1995 Tile Calorimeter setup in terms of \(\pi/e\), taking advantage of what was learned from production modules. In particular, we devoted attention to the following aspects of the 1995 data:

1. Optimal electron/pion separation in electron runs in order to minimize contamination biases in measuring the electron response.
2. Electron linearity and response over the available energy range. Linearity was established over the range of 20 to 150 GeV.
3. Choice of hadron runs with small or negligible electron contamination. Out of three hadron energy scans, one was found with these characteristics.
4. Careful inspection of this hadron data set for spurious effects. Several such effects were found and corrected for, as described in Section 5.
5. Cell intercalibration using 90\({}^{\circ}\) muons impinging on all 18 tile-rows. Procedures were developed to preserve the previously established electromagnetic response within 1-2%.
6. Correction for the proton fraction in the three runs with positive particles, assuming the proton fractions measured in 2002.
7. Corrections for longitudinal and transverse leakages.

The fully corrected \(\pi/e\) ratio is to a good approximation linear as a function of the logarithm of the nominal beam energy, which implies that it is well parametrized _a la_ Wigmans, giving \(e/h=1.34\pm 0.01\) (where the error is only statistical). The results can also be parametrized _a la_ Groom obtaining \(e/h=1.49\pm 0.03\) and \(m=0.78\pm 0.01\).

The fully corrected \(\pi/e\) ratio is compared with the results from the 2002-2003 test beam data obtained with the production modules at \(\eta=0.35\) (\(\theta\simeq 20^{\circ}\)). We observe a 9.2% increase of \(\pi/e\) over the energy range of 20 to 300 GeV in the 1995 data vs. an increase of 6.3% with projective pions at 20\({}^{\circ}\) in the 2002-2003 test beam data.

In comparing the \(\pi/e\) ratio obtained from prototype modules and production modules, we note that overall scale of this ratio is the same in the two data sets, well within the estimated error on the e.m. scale of 2.3% for prototype modules.

## Acknowledgements

Many colleagues were of great help in reanalysing these data, which were taken 12 years before this project was undertaken. We are particularly grateful to Tomas Davidek for his comments, to Ana Henriques for pointing out to us several of the effects that are investigated in this note, and to Sasha Solodkov for help with the data themselves. Of course, the analysis methods and several results rely on the work of many colleagues over the last 15 years.

Method of \(e/\pi\) separation and pion background determination in electron runs

In Section 4.1 we defined the zones I, II and III in the scatter plot of \(f_{sum}\) vs. \(C_{tot}\) (Fig. 5). In this appendix we illustrate the procedure to estimate the pion contamination in the ambiguous zone II at 20 GeV and in the almost pure electron zone III.

In Fig. 37 a scatter plot of the energy fraction of cell 8 (\(EC8/E_{nom}\)) vs. the energy fraction of cell 2 (\(EC2/E_{nom}\)) is shown. Three areas can be identified by means of the two vertical lines at \(EC2/E_{nom}=0.05\) and \(EC2/E_{nom}=0.6\). The leftmost area (corresponding to \(EC2<1\)GeV) corresponds to pions that interact in the second sampling, their energy deposit in the first sampling being compatible with that of a MIP. It contains 113 events. The middle area (\(0.05<EC2/E_{nom}<0.6\), with 203 events) was taken to consist entirely of pions with relatively high \(f_{sum}\) and \(C_{tot}\) values. This assignation was confirmed by checking that these events do not display the sinusoidal modulation vs. the Z coordinate characteristic of electrons discussed in Appendix B. The rightmost area (\(EC2/E_{nom}>0.6\), containing 1010 events) is mostly composed of electrons, but pions with a high electromagnetic shower fraction are expected to be present.

We retain as electrons the 1010 events with \(EC2/E_{nom}>0.6\) and estimate the pion contamination in this subsampling as follows. A non-interacting particle at 20\({}^{\circ}\) traverses 31.9 cm in the first calorimeter sampling and 42.6 cm in the second sampling. From the pion nuclear interaction length \(\lambda_{I}=26.6\) cm 9 one obtains the fraction of pions in zone II that interact in the second sampling

Footnote 9: The pion nuclear interaction lengths \(\lambda_{I}=26.6\) cm is obtained from the results of Ref. [6] when applying cut 1 defined in that reference.

\[F_{2}=e^{(-31.9/\lambda_{I})}-e^{[-(42.6+31.9)/\lambda_{I}]}=0.301-0.061=0.240 \tag{19}\]

Therefore the total number of pions in zone II is

\[N_{\pi}=\frac{113}{0.234}=471 \tag{20}\]

Figure 37: Energy fraction in cell C8 of the second sampling (\(EC8/E_{nom}\)) vs. the energy fraction in cell C2 of the first sampling (\(EC2/E_{nom}\)) for the ambiguous zone (II).

and the number of pions interacting in the first sampling is

\[F_{1}=471\cdot(1-e^{(-31.9/\lambda_{l})})=329 \tag{21}\]

of which \(N_{\pi}^{II}=329-203=126\) events are the remaining pion background in the rightmost area of Fig. 5.

We apply the same procedure to maximize the purity of the electron sampling and to estimate the remaining pion contamination in zone III. Using the scatter plot of Fig. 38 we obtain an estimate of 18 pions with \(EC2/E_{nom}>0.6\), which are the residual pion contamination affecting the 5194 electrons in this area.

In conclusion, the electron sampling at 20 GeV consists of 6204=5194+1010 electron candidates with an estimated contamination of 126+18=144 events, 2.3% of the electron sample.

Electron response and resolution

As is well known, the electron response of the Tile Calorimeter is sensitive to the local variations of the sampling fraction and thus depends on the impact point along the front face of the calorimeter (Z). This is shown in Figs. 39 and 40.

The variation is well described by a simple periodic function [1]

\[E_{\rm raw}(Z)=p_{0}\left[1+p_{1}\sin\left(2\pi Z/p_{2}+p_{3}\right)\right] \tag{22}\]

where \(p_{0}\) corresponds to the mean energy and is used as the calibration constant. The parameter \(p_{1}\) corresponds to the relative amplitude of this effect. The largest variations appear at small \(|\eta|\) (up to 0.2), decreasing progressively towards larger impact angles.10) The parameter \(p_{2}\) corresponds to the period thickness as seen by the beam at the given impact angle and \(p_{3}\) is a phase. The impact point coordinate \(Z\) is reconstructed using the beam chambers.

Figure 39: Oscillation of the electron response at 20\({}^{\circ}\) and 20 GeV. The oscillation is fit by equation 22.

Using the above formula we correct for the observed oscillation effect and determine the electron response \(p_{0}\).

In addition, the electron energy resolution was determined for the same electron data sets and is shown in Fig. 42 for a run at \(20^{\circ}\). We considered the electron response in three different intervals of the \(Z\) coordinate: the whole range of \(Z\); the crest of the oscillation, where the shower occurs mostly in tiles; and the trough of the oscillation, where comparatively more of the shower is absorbed in iron. These zones are shown in Fig. 41 for an electron run at 20 GeV. The response is given by the fit of the electron distribution at \(\pm 1\sigma\) for each interval.

The energy resolution is expected to scale with the energy as:

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{p_{1}}{\sqrt{E}}+p_{0} \tag{23}\]

where \(p_{1}\) is the statistical term and \(p_{0}\) the constant term. The best resolution is obtained from the crest of the oscillation, as expected. The result of the energy resolution fit is \((30\%\pm 3\%)/\sqrt{E_{beam}}\). It is interesting that both crest and trough fits return zero constant terms, within errors.

Figure 41: The electron response depends on the coordinate of the impact point. We separately fit the data from the crest and the trough of the oscillation.

Cherenkov light produced in WLS fibers, light mixers and PMT windows.

In this appendix we estimate the possible contributions of Cherenkov light produced in Tile Calorimeter optical components other than the scintillating tiles, which might bias the measurements of total particle energy.

To quantify direct light production in the WLS fibers we analysed a run with 90\({}^{\circ}\) muons in the crack between modules 3 and 4. In Fig. 43 we see the signal produced directly in the fibers. The sum of top PMT signals of 5 towers (sampling 1) of module 3 as a function of the Y impact point is shown in the left plot. The analogous sum of bottom PMT signals of module 4 is shown in the right plot. The two peaks are the signals produced directly in the fibers. Quantitatively, the signal is given by the integral \(\int(Signal-Pedestal)dy\), resulting in an average value of 40 MeV over its 4 mm span. This signal represents the sum of about 50 fibres, one for each 18 mm period. Altogether we estimate that a direct light signal of 3.2 MeV per fiber is produced.

We also compared the direct fiber signal to the signal from the scintillator light transmitted into fibers. Two different cases are shown in Fig. 44, in which muons impact tile 5 at 90\({}^{\circ}\), 2 cm below the crack between modules (left) and directly in the crack (right). The signal from the scintillator is about 1 GeV and again comes from the sum of about 50 scintillating tiles. Therefore the scintillator light signal per tile is approximately 20 MeV. In these cases the "fiber peak" is not seen because it is much smaller than the signal from tiles.

Figure 44: Scintillator light signal in fibers coupled to sampling 2 tile 5 as function of Y impact point, 2 cm below the crack in the left plot, and in the crack in the right plot.

Figure 43: Sum of top PMT signals in 5 towers from module 3 (left plot), and same sum for bottom PMTs of module 4 (right scatter plot) as a function of the Y coordinate of the impact point. The two peaks are the signal produced directly in the fibers.

We find that the direct fiber signal is less than the scintillator signal, 3.2 MeV per fiber traversed instead of 20 MeV per tile traversed. To assess the relative importance of fiber and scintillator signals one must also consider the ratio of fibres and tile volumes. In the prototype modules the volume of tiles is about 100 times the volume of fibres. Thus for muons at 90\({}^{\circ}\) the fiber signal is only 0.16% (3.2/(20\(\times\)100) of the light produced in scintillator tiles.

We remark that these measurements do not completely exclude the possibility of significant light production in WLS fibers _in projective geometry_, because of the directionality of Cherenkov light. However considering that the Cherenkov angle in the WLS fibers is nearly 45\({}^{\circ}\) it appears that even at 90\({}^{\circ}\) incidence Cerenkov light production in fibers would be detected with significant efficiency.

Next, a different mechanism of Cherenkov light production is discussed. In projective geometry there may be particles that reach the downstream end of the calorimeter (due to leakage or lack of interaction) and generate Cherenkov light by traversing the fiber bundle and/or the PMT windows and/or the light-mixers. Indeed such signals were detected in special runs with prototype modules [8].

Counting hits in the muon wall gives a rough estimate of the signal to be expected. The mean \(<E_{C}>\) of this Cherenkov light signal is

\[<E_{C}>=E_{Hit}\cdot f_{a^{\cdot}}<N_{Hit}> \tag{24}\]

where \(E_{Hit}\) is the Cherenkov signal for each hit, \(N_{Hit}\) is the average number of hits per event in the muon wall and \(f_{a}\) is the ratio of the total area of PMT windows in a module to the muon wall area.

\[f_{a}=(\frac{PMTs\ area}{Wall\ area})\simeq 0.08 \tag{25}\]

The number of hits per event depends on the energy of the beam, because at high energy more particles will leak out the back of the calorimeter, traverse to the module. With the section of muon wall located behind the modules, the number of hits per event is found to be \(N_{Hit}\simeq 0.8\) at 20 GeV and \(N_{Hit}\simeq 2\) at 100 and 180 GeV.

The signal from a particle passing through a fiber bundle/PMT window/light mixer area can be taken from the results of the dedicated run just mentioned [8], which showed that the typical signal in these special cases is about 350 MeV (on the EM scale). Collecting the three factors in equation 24 one obtains \(<E_{C}>=0.35\ GeV/hit\times 0.08\times 0.8\) hits/event = 0.02 GeV/event at \(E_{beam}=20\ GeV\). The average effect of such events appears negligible.

A complementary approach is to look for events with large Cherenkov signals. Applying the technique used earlier in this note, one looks for a signal in a PMT reading out the first or second sampling when there is a large energy deposit in a downstream sampling. It is difficult to identify such events in pion runs because of the presence of optical cross-talk. Alternatively, one may look for large (electromagnetic) energy deposits in muon projective data. When there is a such a large deposit in sampling 4, there may be particles leaking out of the end of the calorimeter that produce Cherenkov light in the area of one of the PMTs that read out one of the upstream samplings. A larger-than-expected signal in such PMTs would indicate the production of Cherenkov light.

These signals were searched for in muon data at \(10^{\circ}\), for Z= - 8 cm and Z = - 6 cm, with a set of runs in which a scan along the Y axis was performed, from the middle of the module to the edges (-3 to -20 cm). The trajectory of the muons within module 3 and the layout of the PMTs of tower 4 are respectively shown in the right and left sketches of Fig. 45.

Only a few events with anomalously high signals in one PMT were found. An example is shown in Fig. 46, where the muon has a large energy deposit in cell C19. A large signal of about 6 GeV is seen in PMT 8 but not in PMT 7. Such anomalous signals may be produced by Cherenkov light, however one cannot make strong claims from the very few events observed with these characteristics. In any case it is clear that these few events would hardly affect the calculation of the mean total energies.

Figure 46: A muon leaves a typical signal in the cells along the track and produces an EM shower in the last sampling. The 6 GeV signal in PMT 8 is may be produced by Cherenkov light in the PMT area.

Figure 45: The sketch on the left shows the PMTs that read out tower 4. The sketch on the right shows the impact point of the beam at \(+10^{\circ}\) and \(Z=-8cm\). Here, cell 4 is read out by PMTs 7 and 8 which are located behind tower 4 at the downstream end of module.
