Using neutron beam from JINR pulse neutron source IBR-30, the efficiency of pressurized drift tubes (PDT) for detection of neutrons with energy between 5 eV and 200 keV was investigated. PDT were made of aluminum and steel and filled with a gas mixture composed of \(Ar\), 15% \(CO_{2}\) and 3.5% \(C_{4}H_{10}\) at 1 and 3 atm. The efficiency was proved to be less then 1% in this range of neutron energy.

Introduction

One of the features of experiments at the LHC and SSC accelerators is the significant background of neutrons and \(\gamma-\)quanta [1, 2, 3]. The main sources of this background are electromagnetic and hadronic showers produced by secondary particles in the beam pipe, in the upstream calorimeters, the front and inside surfaces of the insertion quadrupole and its shielding. Besides low-\(p_{t}\) pp-collisions at the interaction point, secondary particles are produced by interactions of the beam with the residual gas in the beam pipe and by the local beam losses in the collider tunnel. The spectrum of secondary neutrons in the energy region \(<1\) MeV is the typical neutron spectrum observed behind the shielding of a nuclear reactor [4]. Background fluxes in the ATLAS hall is estimated, if special safety measures are not undertaken, to be between \(10^{4}\) and \(10^{5}n/cm^{2}/s\)[2, 5] depending on the actual location of the muon detectors. Since muon detectors are used particularly for detecting minimum ionizing particles, this background can affect the pattern recognition efficiency and the performance of the Level-1 trigger. Therefore, it is important not only to carry out work for reducing the neutron background, but also to perform a detailed investigation of the neutron and \(\gamma-\)quantum detection efficiency of various types of detectors along with choosing appropriate materials for reducing the interaction rate of these particles in the detectors.

So far studies of the sensitivity of drift tubes to a neutron background have been made with \({}^{252}Cf\) sources [6, 7, 8]. The method of studying detector efficiencies with the aid of radioactive sources does not permit determining the spectral sensitivity of detectors to neutrons of various energies. Available experimental results concern the integral sensitivity in the region of thermal (\(E<0.5\) eV) and fast (\(E>100\) keV) neutrons. The efficiency of drift tube filled with isobutane in the region of thermal neutrons equals \(1.2\cdot 10^{-3}\) for aluminum and \(2\cdot 10^{-3}\) for steel tubes, while in the region of fast neutrons efficiency is equal \(1.7-1.8\cdot 10^{-3}\)[8]. Estimates of the efficiency made on the basis of computer calculations simulating the passage of neutrons through various materials yield the following figures: \(2\cdot 10^{-5}\) for thermal and \(2\cdot 10^{-4}\) for fast neutrons [8]. Nothing can be said, on the basis of these results, about the role of various mechanisms providing for neutron detection, and no analysis of the construction and materials of the detector can be performed.

Within the framework of the project ATLAS [1] we have performed the first measurements of the spectral sensitivity to neutrons of energies between 5 eV and 200 keV for aluminum and steel drift tubes for various pressures of the operating gas. Measurements were carried out with the aid of the time-of-flight method with the neutron beam of the JINR IBR-30 pulsed neutron source.

Experimental method

The arrangement of the main elements of the apparatus and the block diagram of the electronics are shown in Fig.1. The core of the IBR-30 pulsed neutron source has a fixed and a moving part. Two cassettes of the fixed part of the source contain \({}^{239}Pu\) and are opposite each other. The rotating part is a disk on which along the diameter precisely opposite each other there are two pieces of \({}^{235}U\). The revolution frequency is 50 Hz. The total mass of fissionable matter is lower than the critical value. When one of the pieces of \({}^{235}U\) happens to be between the fixed cassettes of the core of \({}^{239}Pu\), the 40 MeV electron beam from the LUE-40 pulsed linac impinges on a tungsten target, which is actually inside the core of the source. During measurements the electron beam intensity was kept at a level providing for a 10 kW power production of the IBR-30 source. The burst of the source was 4.5 \(\mu\)s long.

Before landing in the neutron guide the neutrons passed through a water moderator 4 cm thick. The path along the evacuated neutron guide also included two sections of air and several aluminum foils (2 mm thick vacuum windows). Ten meters in front of the tubes to be studied there was a steel collimator filled with paraffin and \(B_{4}C\), which determined the final dimensions of the beam, 12 cm in the horizontal plane and 15 cm in the vertical plane. The beam was monitored with the aid of a proportional counter filled with \({}^{3}He\) at a pressure of 6.3 atm, placed at a distance of 1.5 meters behind the drift tubes. Calibration of the counter was performed in separate experiments. Its \(\gamma-\)quantum counting efficiency did not exceed \(10^{-4}\).

In the experiment, the counting rates of the investigated drift tubes placed at a distance of 250 m from the neutron source were measured versus the time interval since the last burst of the neutron source. The signal synchronized with the LUE-40 electron beam served as the trigger signal for two TDCs. The pulses from the investigated tube and the monitor counter were amplified and input to the TDC as "stop" signals. The time encoding systems transmitted information to the buffer memory during data acquisition. Owing to the measured time of flight being inversely proportional to the square root of the neutron energy, it was convenient to divide the whole time interval between the neighboring bursts of the source into three time windows 256 \(\mu\)sec, 512 \(\mu\)sec and 8.192 msec long, while the TDC sensitivities in the windows were fixed at 1, 2 and 16 \(\mu\)sec/channel, respectively. After 30 minutes of measurement the data accumulated in the buffer memory were sent to a PC for processing. Besides the above, the total counts from two additional counters, situated in the hall of the reactor for monitoring the reactor power, were recorded in the computer memory also.

We investigated the spectral sensitivities of pressurized drift tubes (PDT) made of aluminum and steel filled with a gas mixture composed of \(Ar\), 15% \(CO_{2}\) and 3.5% \(C_{4}H_{10}\) at 1 and 3 atm. The steel tube was 30 mm in diameter, its wall was 0.5 mm thick, and the diameter of the tungsten signal wire was 50 \(\mu\)m. The external diameter of the aluminum tube was 50 mm, its wall was 1.0 mm thick, and the diameter of the signal tungsten wire was 50 \(\mu\)m. Besides the above, in the aluminum tube there were six additional wires 100 \(\mu\)m in diameter stretched at a distance of 13 mm from the signal wire, that shaped an electric field of special configuration. The efficiency of this tube was studied in conditions when a voltage was applied to the shaping electrodes and when the additional electrodes were disconnected from the voltage supply. The voltages applied to the PDT corresponded to the plateau in the detection efficiency of minimum ionizing particles in the case of operation in the proportional mode.

## 3 The neutron spectrum

At the site of the detectors being investigated there was a significant background of neutrons of low energies owing to the relatively long time-of-flight base. In fact, the time between adjacent bursts of the source was less than the time-of-flight of neutrons with energies lower than 3.3 eV from the source to the PDT, and such neutrons as if to be accumulated in the neutron guide. To prevent this background from hindering measurements a boron carbide filter was placed 10 m in front of the PDT. The filter was 10 mm thick, which resulted in reduction of the background of relaxation neutrons in a factor of \(\sim exp(-5.5/sqrt(E_{eV}))\).

In Fig.2 the time-of-flight spectrum measured with the neutron monitor is shown. At the beginning of the spectrum a peak is observed which is related to extensive production of \(\gamma-\)quanta at the moment of the burst. Its width is determined by the duration of the burst of the neutron source and corresponds to the resolution of the apparatus in the range of neutron energies higher than 200 eV. At certain parts of the smoothly decreasing time dependence peculiarities are observed that are related to resonance absorption of neutrons in the aluminum foils of the neutron guide. The arrows in the figure indicate the positions of the aluminum and manganese resonances playing the main role in attenuation of the neutron beam.

Fig.3 represents the neutron energy spectrum at the position of the tubes. Here, also, a spectrum is presented that is calculated for a given distance from the source on the basis of the empirical dependence found by approximating measurements of the neutron beam spectrum from the IBR-30 in the range of energies between 10 eV and 10 keV [9]. In these calculations the absorbtion of the neutrons in the duraluminum and air resulting from potential scattering has been taken into account. The data from the neutron monitor are in good agreement with previously performed measurements. The small discrepancy in the range of neutron energies close to 10 eV can, most likely, be explained by the insufficient thickness of the utilized boron carbide filter. In the range of neutron energies \(>200\) keV the time resolution of the apparatus is already insufficient for effective separation of neutronsof various energies.

## 4 The photon background

During measurements with the neutron beam there was present a significant background of \(\gamma-\)quanta produced both in the neutron source itself (mainly as a result of decays of nuclides that were fission products) and in interactions of the neutron beam with the matter encountered along its path. Therefore, one can describe the counts of PDT as follows:

\[N_{t}=\varepsilon_{\gamma}S_{\gamma}+\varepsilon_{n}S_{n} \tag{1}\]

where, \(\varepsilon_{\gamma}\) -- efficiency for detection of \(\gamma-\)quanta, \(S_{\gamma}\) -- spectrum of \(\gamma-\)quanta, \(\varepsilon_{n}\) -- efficiency for detection of neutrons, \(S_{n}\) -- spectrum of neutrons. To take into account the influence of the \(\gamma-\)background measurements were performed with a paraffin target 3.5 cm thick. With additional filter the counts of PDT is defined by the formula:

\[N_{t}^{\prime}=\varepsilon_{\gamma}S_{\gamma}e^{-n\sigma_{\gamma}x}+\varepsilon _{n}S_{n}e^{-n\sigma_{n}x} \tag{2}\]

where, \(\sigma_{\gamma}\) -- total cross-section of interaction of \(\gamma-\)quanta with filter material, \(\sigma_{n}\) -- total cross-section of interaction of neutrons with filter material, \(x\) -- thickness of the filter, \(n\) -- concentration of filter material. The paraffin target we used attenuated the flux of neutrons with energies up to 50 keV by a factor of greater than 100. At high energies the fraction of neutrons passing through the paraffin increased continuously, and at an energy of 200 keV it was equal to 8%.

For estimating the absorption of beam \(\gamma-\)quanta in the paraffin target itself measurements were also performed with aluminum filters 3 and 6 cm thick were put in succession together with the paraffin. Provided the cross-sections of absorption of \(\gamma-\)quanta contributing to the photon background with paraffin and aluminum being approximately equal, correction coefficients were found by extrapolating the results of measurements with paraffin and aluminum filters of various thicknesses to paraffin of zero thickness. In Fig.4 the correction coefficients are plotted versus the TDC channel number for the steel tube. There, also, one can see the result of the coefficients determined having been fitted with a smooth dependence. The small discrepancy in the values of the correction coefficients at the beginning of the time spectrum may be due to the influence of neutrons that passed through the paraffin filter. Ultimately, efficiency of PDT was calculated as follows:

\[\varepsilon_{n}=(N_{t}-kN_{t}^{\prime})/S_{n}(1-e^{-n\sigma_{n}x}) \tag{3}\]

In Fig.5 the spectrum measured with the aid of the steel tube is shown together with the \(\gamma-\)background for the entire range of energies studied. In the region of energies from 5 eV up to approximately 1 keV the counting rate of the tube is totally determined by the counts of \(\gamma-\)quanta. In this energy range the contribution of neutrons to the spectrum measured by the tube is less than the statistical measurement error, therefore, only the upper limit of the neutron detection efficiency can be determined for the tubes.

## 5 The results

The efficiencies of the steel and aluminum tube with the working gas mixture at a pressure of 3 atm are presented in Fig.6 (only scale of statistical errors presented in the plot). In the energy region below 1 keV only the upper limit of the efficiency, corresponding to a 90% confidence level, is given. In these measurements the neutron detection efficiency of all the tubes is felt only at the energies of above 1 keV. The efficiency of the steel tube is greater than that of the aluminum tube, although the diameter of the steel tube is less then the diameter of the aluminum tube. It can mean that the radiative absorption of the neutrons by atomic nuclei of the tube wall followed by registration of the emitting gammas in the working gas volume is essential mechanism responsible for neutron detection of the steel tube. For the aluminum tube this mechanism is less important. First, density of the wall material of the aluminum tube is less than that of the steel tube. Second, cross section of the neutron radiation absorption by aluminum is approximately one tenth than the same cross section of steel.

The efficiencies of both tubes increase with the neutron energy in the range from 1 to 10 keV. The efficiency of the steel tube has increased in 4 times, while the efficiency of the aluminum one has increased in 8 times. For neutron energies more than 10 keV the efficiency values don't change. In this energy range the mechanism of ionization of the gas by recoil protons knocked out of isobutane molecules begins to work. The energy that can be transferred by a proton of kinetic energy T to a free electron is \(E=4mM/(m+M)^{2}\), where m and M are the electron and proton masses, respectively. Thus, only protons of energies above a few keV are capable of ionizing the gas efficiently. Therefore, for both tubes in the energy range of more than 10 keV the main mechanism seems to be knocked out of the recoil protons by the neutrons from the working gas.

In the time-of-flight and energy spectra of the steel tube one can see a resonance which can be seen in the efficiency dependence too. Its appearance results from resonance absorption of neutrons in the walls of the tube and subsequent de-excitation of the nucleus produced via emission of a \(\gamma-\)quantum. Besides, the relatively large cross sections, the observed 1.1 keV resonance of iron exhibits large \(\gamma-\)branching.

The efficiencies of the steel and aluminum tubes with working gases at various pressures are compared in Figs.7 and 8, respectively. The efficiency increases approximately proportionally to the amount of the gas in the tube. It occurs because of increasing of the role of as the knockout of the recoil nuclei as the radiation absorption of the neutrons in the walls due to increasing probability of the secondary \(\gamma\) registration. Fig.9 presents the efficiencies of the aluminum tube at a pressure of 3 atm, measured when voltage was applied to the additional shaping electrodes and in the absence of this voltage. The shaping electrodes are arranged in space so as to form a limited sensitive volume in the central part of the tube with the electric potential distributed uniformly along the drift direction of the charges. The efficiency decreased in proportion to the reduction of sensitive volume, when voltage was applied to the shaping electrodes.

## 6 Conclusion

The spectral sensitivity of drift tubes to neutrons was studied with the aid of the time-of-flight technique. In the energy range from 1 keV up to 200 keV the spectral efficiency of PDT to neutrons was measured. The efficiency of the tubes tested starts to rise at a neutron energy of several keV and reaches \(2\cdot 10^{-3}\) at \(E>10\) keV. In this range the knockout of recoil nuclei from elements composing the working gas mixture is the main mechanism responsible for the detection of neutrons. For the neutron energies less than 5 keV the main mechanism is radiation absorption of neutrons in the wall materials. In our case this mechanism is 4 times greater for the steel tube than for the aluminum tube. Our data are in agreement with measurements performed with a \({}^{252}Cf\) radioactive source and, also, in qualitative agreement with the data of ref. [11] on the sensitivity of drift chambers to neutrons, wherein the chambers are shown to exhibit the highest neutron counting rates in the energy range between 5 keV and 1 MeV.

Resonance absorption of neutrons by elements composing structural materials or gas mixtures results in a noticeable efficiency (\(\varepsilon>10^{-3}\)) only in the case of resonances with large cross sections and significant \(\gamma-\)branching ratios. As a rule, however, these resonances are narrow and their contribution to the total count in neutron fields is insignificant. Other resonances have small probabilities of \(\gamma-\)quantum emission (less than 1%), which obviously results in the neutron detection efficiency being essentially lower.

In future experiments we intend to extend the energy range of studies of the PDT spectral sensitivity to neutrons to energies between 200 keV and 2 MeV and to make use of a larger time-of-flight base of the IBR-30 source, and, also, to carry out studies in the 0.1 - 1000 eV energy range using the IBR-2 source, which is more adapted for this energy region.
