Top-quark processes, including pair production, single-top production and production in association with electroweak bosons, are modelled by the ATLAS Collaboration by matching the hard-scatter matrix element calculations of next-to-leading order Monte-Carlo generators with a parton shower generator. This document presents a comprehensive study of the uncertainty related to the matching procedure and a new strategy to evaluate this uncertainty. The new approach is based on the Pythia 8 parton-shower matching parameter \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\). It is designed to surpass the previous method, which involved comparing two generator setups to cover the uncertainty. The old method entangled all differences between the two setups in a single uncertainty while the new prescription implements a focused uncertainty that avoids double-counting with other uncertainties on the modelling of the top processes. Two other effects, previously covered by the matching uncertainty, are studied in parallel: the mismodeling of the top-quark transverse momentum and the top-quark decay lineshape. The first is addressed through a reweighting to the NNLO analytic calculation while the second is studied using two different calculations for the top-quark decay. While the first study leads to the definition of an uncertainty prescription, in the second case it is concluded that comparisons with more advanced generators are needed to define an uncertainty on the lineshape. The samples generated to define the new prescriptions are compared with the setups previously used using unfolded data at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\) and Monte-Carlo simulations of both top-quark pair and single top-quark processes.

## 1 Introduction

In ATLAS, the main method used for modeling top-quark processes such as pair production, single-top production, and production in association with electroweak bosons involves matching the next-to-leading order (NLO) Monte Carlo (MC) calculation of the hard-scatter provided by PowhegBox[1; 2; 3; 4] to the parton shower (PS) provided by Pythia 8[5]. Matching is the procedure that connects the hard-scatter generator to the PS such that it encompasses the full evolution of the event, from the partonic \(2\to 3\) process to the inclusion of additional radiations by initial and final state particles, without leaving holes or double counting regions of the radiation phase-space.

The uncertainties on the modelling of these processes limits the precision of many measurements of top quark production [6; 7; 8]. In addition, many searches and measurements of rare processes (e.g \(t\bar{t}H\)), dominated by background processes containing top quarks, are also limited by the modelling of these processes [9; 10]. It is thus essential to improve the existing definition of these uncertainties to better isolate each source and avoid double-counting of effects.

During Run 2, the uncertainty on the matching procedure was evaluated by comparing two different algorithms: the one used in PowhegBox and the MC@NLO matching algorithm [11]. This uncertainty was estimated by comparing two setups, the nominal PowhegBox+Pythia 8 and a prediction obtained with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8[12]. As already studied extensively in Ref. [13], this definition of the uncertainty covers multiple effects (e.g. different settings of the showering algorithm, adjusted to the hard-scatter generator, the settings and approaches used in the top-quark decay) beyond the uncertainty arising from the matching procedure.

This note introduces a new method to estimate the uncertainty on the matching procedure, based on the Pythia 8 parameter \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) following the proposal in [14]. This parameter regulates how the Pythia 8 radiation phase-space is determined. The approach used in the matching between Powheg and Pythia 8 is called vetoed shower, where Pythia 8 generates emissions in the full phase-space but vetoes the emissions in regions of the phase space already covered by Powheg. In both Powheg and Pythia 8 the order of the emissions in the event evolution is based on a variable related to the transverse momentum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)), called "hardness". A difference in the definition of hardness employed in the two generators leads to double counting or regions in the phase space not modelled by Powheg or Pythia 8. The essential aspect of the vetoed shower is for Pythia 8 to be aware of the hardness value used in Powheg. Powheg provides the information on the hardness value used in each event as additional information in the LHE files, used as input to Pythia 8, under the variable SCALUP. If there are no real emissions produced by Powheg("Born-like" events), the hardness is unequivocally defined by the value of SCALUP. In cases with a real emission from Powheg  there are multiple possibilities in the definition of the hardness value, and the one employed is selected by the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) setting [15]:

* \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}=0\): the SCALUP value is directly employed to define the hardness for every event. This is the default setting in ATLAS.
* \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}=1\): the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the Powheg emission is chosen to define the hardness.
* \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}=2\): the minimal \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) among all the final-state partons is chosen to define the hardness [16].

Another ambiguity in the hardness criteria is the definition of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), which differs between the Powheg and Pythia 8 generators. The definition employed is selected by the Pythia 8 parameter \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{def}}\) setting [15]:

* \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{def}}=0\): the Powheg \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) definition.

* \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm def}\) = 1 : the Powheg\(p_{\rm T}\) for inital-state radiation and a distance parameter for final-state radiation.
* \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm def}\) = 2 : the Pythia definitions.

In ATLAS, this parameter has been set to 2, to improve the agreement between the data and the predictions. The variation of this parameter is not indicated as a way to assess the uncertainty on the matching procedure by the Pythia 8 developers.

In this note, the MC simulations obtained using the three possible \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm hard}\) values are compared on several kinematic distributions for three processes: top-quark pair production (\(t\bar{t}\)), \(tW\)-production, and single top-quark production in the \(t\)-channel. In the \(t\bar{t}\) case the predictions are also compared to unfolded data, measured by the ATLAS collaboration at \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\). Comparisons between the variations of the \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm def}\) and the \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm hard}\) parameter are also included, as are the comparisons between the variations of \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm hard}\) and of the Powheg\(h_{\rm damp}\) parameter, which regulates the high-\(p_{\rm T}\) radiation against which the \(t\bar{t}\) system recoils and thus both parameters affecting the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the extra-radiations.

The comparison between MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8 and Powheg+Pythia 8 covered additional effects beyond the matching uncertainty, some of which may reflect in genuine systematic uncertainties in the MC generation. Specifically, both the impact of the top-quark decay lineshape and the mismodeling of the top-quark \(p_{\rm T}\) from Powheg are no longer covered by the new matching uncertainty using \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm hard}\). To account for these effects, dedicated samples were studied and strategies are outlined in this note.

This note is structured as follows: the detailed description of the generator settings is given in Section 2, while in Section 3 a brief description of the analyses employed to obtain the various kinematic distributions is given, and the variables used for the studies are outlined. Comparisons for alternative \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm hard}\), \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm def}\) and \(h_{\rm damp}\) settings are presented in Section 4. The strategies devised to cover the lineshape effects and the top-quark \(p_{\rm T}\) mismodelling are described in Section 5. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 6.

## 2 MC generators configurations

In this section, the different MC configurations for the three processes of interest are presented. Some comparisons on the \(t\bar{t}\) process and all the comparisons for the single top \(t\)-channel production are performed using events that have been processed with the ATLAS detector simulation based on GEANT4 [17] and are referred to as _detector-level_. For all of these detector-level samples, the effect of multiple interactions in the same and neighboring bunch crossings (pile-up) is modelled by overlaying simulated inelastic proton-proton (\(pp\)) events generated with Pythia 8.186 [18] using the NNPDF2.3nlo[19] set of parton distribution functions (PDF) [20] and the A3 tune [21] over the original hard-scattering event. In all samples, the decays of bottom and charm hadrons are simulated using the EvtGen v1.6.0 program [22].

### Top-quark pair production

The production of \(t\bar{t}\) events is modelled using the PowhegBox v2 [1, 2, 3, 4] generator which provides matrix elements at NLO in the strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{\rm s}\) with the NNPDF3.0nlo[19] parton distribution function (PDF). The functional form of the renormalisation and factorisation scales is set to the default scale \(\sqrt{m_{\rm t}^{2}+p_{\rm T}^{2}}\), using a top-quark mass \(m_{\rm t}=172.5\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The \(h_{\rm damp}\) parameter, which regulates the high-\(p_{\rm T}\) radiation against which the \(t\bar{t}\) system recoils in Powheg, is set to 1.5 \(m_{\rm t}\)[23]. An additional sample with \(h_{\rm damp}\) set to 3.0 \(m_{\rm t}\) is employed to perform comparisons between the \(h_{\rm damp}\) and \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm hard}\) variations. The events were matched with Pythia 8.230 [5] for the parton shower and hadronisation, using the A14 set of tuned parameters [24] and the NNPDF2.3lo set of PDFs [20]. The nominal sample was generated with the \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm hard}\) parameter set to 0 while the two variations considered for the definition of the matching uncertainty have \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm hard}\) set to 1 or 2. The default \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm def}\) parameter employed in the sample is equal to 2, but samples with this parameter set to 0 and 1 are also generated.

The alternative configuration used in the Run 2 matching uncertainty prescription employed as hard-scattering generator MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.6.0 with the NNPDF3.0nlo[19] PDF and Pythia 8.230 for the PS, using the A14 set of tuned parameters and the NNPDF2.3lo set of PDFs. Top quarks are decayed at leading-order (LO) with MadSpin[25, 26] to preserve spin correlations. The shower starting scale has the functional form \(\mu_{\rm q}=H_{\rm T}/2\)[27], where \(H_{\rm T}\) is defined as the scalar sum of the \(p_{\rm T}\) of all outgoing partons. The renormalisation and factorisation scale choice is the same as for the Powheg setup.

An additional sample is generated using next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) precision in QCD for the hard-scatter as implemented in Ref. [28]. The functional form of the renormalisation and factorisation scales is set to \(H_{\rm T}^{t\bar{t}\rm jets}/4\), using a top-quark mass \(m_{\rm t}=172.5\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The PDF set employed is NNPDF3.0nnlo. The sample is interfaced with Pythia 8.230, using the A14 set of tuned parameters and the NNPDF2.3lo set of PDFs. Three different samples with different configurations of the \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm hard}\) and \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm def}\) parameters are generated and compared to data: \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm hard}\) =0 and \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm def}\) =1, \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm hard}\) =0 and \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm def}\) =2, \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm hard}\) =1 and \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm def}\) =1.

All \(t\bar{t}\) samples are normalised to the cross-section prediction at NNLO in QCD including the resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) soft-gluon terms, calculated using Top++2.0 [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. For proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\), this cross section corresponds to \(\sigma(t\bar{t})_{\rm NNLO+NNLL}=832\pm 51\,\mathrm{pb}\) using a top-quark mass of \(m_{\rm t}=172.5\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The uncertainties on the cross-section due to PDF and \(\alpha_{\rm s}\) are calculated using the PDF4LHC prescription [36] with the MSTW2008 68% CL NNLO [37, 38], CT10 NNLO [39, 40] and NNPDF2.3 5f FFN [20] PDF sets, and are added in quadrature to the scale uncertainty.

### Associated \(tW\) production

Single-top \(tW\) production is modelled using the Powheg Box v2 [41, 2, 3, 4] generator, which provides matrix elements at NLO in the strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{\rm s}\) in the five-flavour scheme with the NNPDF3.0nlo PDF set. The functional form of the renormalisation and factorisation scales was set to the default scale, which is equal to the top-quark mass (\(m_{\rm t}=172.5\,\mathrm{GeV}\)). The events are interfaced with Pythia 8.230 using the A14 tune and the NNPDF2.3lo PDF set. As with the \(t\bar{t}\) samples, the nominal sample is generated with the \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm hard}\) parameter set to 0, and the two variations considered for the definition of the matching uncertainty have \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm hard}\) set to 1 and 2. In contrast to \(t\bar{t}\) the two additional parameters \(h_{\rm damp}\) and \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm def}\) are not studied for this process.

A \(tW\) sample generated with the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.6.2, which provides matrix elements at NLO in the strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{\rm s}\) in the five-flavour scheme, using the NNPDF2.3lo[19] PDF set, was employed during Run2 to estimate the matching uncertainty. The functional form of the renormalisation and factorisation scale is set to the default scale, equal to the top-quark mass. The parton-shower starting scale had the functional form \(\mu_{\rm q}=H_{\rm T}/2\). The events are interfaced with Pythia 8.230 [5], using the A14 set of tuned parameters [24] and the NNPDF2.3lo PDF.

In all \(tW\) samples, the diagram removal scheme [42] was employed to handle the interference with \(tt\) production [23]. The inclusive cross-section is normalised to the theory prediction calculated at NLO in QCD with NNLL soft-gluon resummation [43, 44]. For proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\), this cross-section corresponds to \(\sigma(tW)_{\mathrm{NLO+NNLL}}=71.7\pm 3.8\,\mathrm{pb}\), using a top-quark mass of \(m_{\mathrm{t}}=172.5\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The uncertainty in the cross-section due to the PDF was calculated using the MSTW2008nnlo 90% CL [37, 38] PDF set, and was added in quadrature to the effect of the scale uncertainty.

### Single-top \(t\)-channel

Single-top \(t\)-channel production is modelled using the Powheg Box v2 [2, 3, 4, 45] generator at NLO accuracy in the strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}\) in the four-flavour scheme with the corresponding NNPDF3.0nlo[19] PDF set. The functional form of the renormalisation and factorisation scales is set to \(\sqrt{m_{b}^{2}+p_{\mathrm{T,\,}b}^{2}}\) following the recommendation of Ref. [45]. The events are interfaced with Pythia 8.230 using the A14 tune and the NNPDF2.3lo PDF set. Again the nominal sample is generated with the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) parameter set to 0 while the two variations considered for the definition of the matching uncertainty have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) set to 1 and 2. For this process the \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{def}}\) variations are not studied within the scope of this note.

In the Run2 approach to evaluate the uncertainty on the matching scheme, the nominal sample was compared with a sample generated with the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.6.2 generator at NLO in the strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}\) in the four-flavour scheme, using the corresponding NNPDF3.0nlo PDF set. The functional form of the renormalisation and factorisation scales was set to \(\sqrt{m_{b}^{2}+p_{\mathrm{T,\,}b}^{2}}\). Top quarks are decayed at LO using MadSpin, and the events are subsequently interfaced with Pythia 8.230, using the A14 set of tuned parameters [24] and the NNPDF2.3lo PDF set.

The samples are normalised to the inclusive cross-section calculated at NNLO in QCD with the MCFM 10.1 program [46]. For proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\), this cross-section corresponds to \(\sigma(t,t\text{-chan})_{\mathrm{NNLO}}=134.2\pm 2.2\,\mathrm{pb}\) for single top-quark production and \(\sigma(\bar{t},t\text{-chan})_{\mathrm{NNLO}}=80.0\pm 1.6\,\mathrm{pb}\) for single-anti-top production, using a top-quark mass of \(m_{\mathrm{t}}=172.5\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The quoted uncertainties include the uncertainties due to the choice of \(\mu_{\mathrm{r}}\) and \(\mu_{\mathrm{f}}\), the uncertainty in the PDFs and in the value of the strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}\). The scale uncertainty is determined by varying \(\mu_{\mathrm{r}}\) and \(\mu_{\mathrm{f}}\) independently up and down by a factor of two, whilst never allowing them to differ by a factor greater than two from each other. The combined PDF and \(\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}\) uncertainties were determined at the 68% C.L. according to the Hessian representation of the PDF4LHC21 PDF set [47].

## 3 Analyses and variables

The detector-level analyses employ the standard ATLAS reconstruction and calibrations for muons [48], electrons [49, 50], and jets [51]. The electrons and the jets are reconstructed combining tracks and calorimeter deposit, while the muons are reconstructed using information from the tracking system and the dedicated muon spectrometer. The jets are reconstructed using the anti-\(k_{T}\)[52] algorithm with radius parameter \(R=0.4\) and are identified as originating from a \(b\)-quark using the DL1r algorithm [53]. The missing transverse energy (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)) is the magnitude of the negative vector sum of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of all selected and calibrated lepton candidates, jets and inner detector (ID) tracks not associated to any reconstructed object [54] in an event.

The analyses without detector simulation (_particle-level_) employ objects defined starting from stable particles (mean lifetime \(>30\,\mathrm{ps}\)). The leptons are required to be _prompt_, that is, directly from a decaying \(W\) boson or through a subsequent \(\tau\)-lepton decay, and not from hadron decay (_non-prompt_). The electrons and muons are dressed by including all photons not originating from hadron decays within a cone \(\Delta R=0.1\) around the bare lepton. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-\(k_{T}\) algorithm with radius parameter \(R=0.4\) from all stable particles excluding prompt dressed leptons and prompt neutrinos. The particle-level jets are identified as \(b\)-tagged if they are ghost-matched [55] to a \(b\)-hadron with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) larger than \(5\,\mathrm{GeV}\).

In section 5.1, an additional analysis is employed to compare directly the kinematic properties of undecayed top-quarks at _parton-level_. The parton- and particle-level analyses are performed using Rivet [56]. The ATLAS measurements mentioned in the following have the corresponding particle-level fiducial phase-space definition and reconstruction strategy also implemented in this framework. This allow to perform a comparisons between the measured data and the predictions outside of the ATLAS software.

The analyses used to compare the various generators are detailed in the following, divided by process.

### Analyses for top-quark pair production

#### 3.1.1 Detector-level analysis (DL_TTBAR1)

This MC-only analysis targets pairs of top quarks in which one of the top quarks decays _hadronically_ to 3 jets (one of which is \(b\)-tagged) and the other decays _leptonically_ to a lepton (\(e,\mu\)), a neutrino, and a \(b\)-tagged jet. Only events containing exactly one electron or one muon with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>27\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) are considered. Events are also required to contain at least 4 jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\,\mathrm{GeV}\), of which at least 2 must be \(b\)-tagged with a 60% efficiency. The top quarks are reconstructed according to the pseudo-top algorithm [57]. This analysis is performed at detector-level at \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\) and assuming an integrated luminosity of \(140\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). After event generation of the \(t\bar{t}\) sample, the response of the ATLAS detector was simulated using the Geant4 toolkit [17] with a full detector model [58] which employed a parameterisation of the calorimeter response. The simulated events were reconstructed using the same software as applied to collision data.

The following variables are employed for the comparisons:

* leading1\(b\)-tagged jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), Footnote 1: The jets are always ordered in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), in all analyses.
* \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), Footnote 2: The jets are always ordered in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), in all analyses.
* jet multiplicity,
* invariant mass of the lepton and \(b\)-tagged jet used to reconstruct the leptonically decaying top quark (\(m_{lb}\)).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

1.4 Measurements of differential cross-sections in top-quark pair events with a high transverse momentum top quark and limits on beyond the Standard Model contributions to top-quark pair production with the ATLAS detector at \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\)[61] (TTBAR4)

This measurement is performed on \(139\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of data collected by the ATLAS experiment and targets events with an hadronically decaying top-quark with large transverse momentum as well as a leptonically decaying top quark. The measurement is performed at particle-level. The fiducial phase-space is characterized by the presence of a single electron or muon with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\ >27\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) and at least 4 jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\ >26\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\). At least two jets are required to be \(b\)-tagged. The events must also have \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>20\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\ +m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W2}>60\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The events must also contain a reclustered [62] jet with radius parameter \(R=1.0\), with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\ >355\,\mathrm{GeV}\), \(|\eta|<2.0\) and mass in the range \([120,\,220]\) GeV. The reclustering approach consists in constructing the large-\(R\) jets by using the \(R=0.4\) jets as input to the anti-\(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) algorithm. The reclustered-jet with leading \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is identified as the hadronically decaying top-quark. The leptonically decaying top-quark is reconstructed from the \(b\)-tagged jet closest to the lepton, the lepton, and the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), using the pseudo-top algorithm. Once the leptonically decaying top-quark is reconstructed, a requirement is added on \(m_{lb}\), which must be less than \(180\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The analysis measures several kinematic observables that describe the hadronically decaying top-quark, the \(t\bar{t}\) system and the additional jets present in the event. The observables considered are:

* the transverse momentum of the \(t\bar{t}\) system \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{t\bar{t}}\),
* the scalar sum of the transverse momentum of the top-quarks and the additional jets in the event \(H_{\mathrm{T}}^{t\bar{t}+jets}\),
* the mass of the \(t\bar{t}\) system \(m^{t\bar{t}}\),
* the transverse momentum of the sub-leading additional jet (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{j,2}\)),
* the transverse momentum of the hadronically decaying top-quark (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{t,h}\)),
* The transverse momentum of the leptonically decaying top-quark (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{t,\ell}\)),
* the number of additional jets in the events (\(N^{j}\)).

#### 3.1.5 Particle-level analysis (TTBAR6)

This analysis is performed on particle-level objects and implements the reconstruction and selection described in the recent paper [63]. The fiducial-phase space is defined by the presence of exactly two leptons (electrons or muons) with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\ >25\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\), at least two neutrinos with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) > 25 GeV, exactly 2 \(b\)-tagged jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) larger than 25 GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\), reconstructed with the anti-\(k_{T}\) algorithm and the radius parameter set to 0.5. Each \(W\) boson is reconstructed using parton level information to correctly match the lepton and the neutrino, while the top quark is then reconstructed matching a \(b\)-jet to the corresponding \(W\) boson using parton level information and including also up to one jet. All the possible combinations with the jets in the event are tested and the selected top-quark candidate is the one with mass closer to \(172.5\,\mathrm{GeV}\). This analysis is performed only on MC samples. Only one observable is considered in this analysis:

* the top-quark mass (Particle level \(m_{t}\))

#### 3.1.6 Parton-level analysis (PL_TTBAR5)

This analysis targets the kinematic properties of the last top quark in the event record before decay. This analysis is performed only on MC samples. The observables considered are:

* the top-quark mass (\(m_{t}\)),
* the mass of the decay product of the top-quark, before any radiation (\(m(Wb)\)),
* the mass of the \(t\bar{t}\) system (\(m_{t\bar{t}}\)).

### Analysis for the associated \(tW\) production

#### 3.2.1 Particle-level analysis (TW) [64]

This analysis is performed on particle-level objects and was originally designed to reconstruct \(t\bar{t}\) events. It requires events containing at least one \(e\) or \(\mu\) with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) >30 GeV and \(|\eta|<4.2\), \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) > 30 GeV, and at least 2 jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) > 30 GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\). If there is exactly one lepton in the event, there must be at least 4 jets. In this analysis the jets are reconstructed using the anti-\(k_{T}\) algorithm with radius parameter \(R=0.6\). The events must also contain exactly 2 \(b\)-tagged jets. This analysis is performed at particle level only on MC samples. The following variables are investigated:

* the number of jets (\(N_{\mathrm{jets}}\)),
* the transverse momentum of the second-leading jet (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}(j_{2})\)),
* the angle between the two leading \(b\)-tagged jets (\(\Delta R(b-\mathrm{jet}_{1},b-\mathrm{jet}_{2})\)),
* the mass of the lepton and the leading \(b\)-tagged jet (\(m(l,b-\mathrm{jet}_{1})\)).

### Analysis for the \(t\)-channel single top-quark production

#### 3.3.1 Detector-level analysis (DL_TCHAN)

This analysis implements the same detector-level selection employed in [65] and targets single top-quark \(t\)-channel production. The events are required to have exactly one charged lepton (electron or muon) with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>28\) GeV, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>30\) GeV, \(m_{T}^{W}>50\) GeV, \(m_{\ell,b}<160\) GeV and exactly two jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV and \(|\eta|<\)4.5. Exactly one of these jets must be \(b\)-tagged. An additional requirement is imposed on the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) based on the azimuthal angle between the lepton and the leading jet (\(j_{1}\)), \(p_{\mathrm{T}}(\ell)>40\cdot\frac{|\Delta\phi(j_{1},\ell)|}{\pi}\) GeV. Events with additional leptons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>10\) GeV are discarded as are events containing a jet with \(2.3<|\eta|<\)4.5 and \(30\) GeV \(<p_{\mathrm{T}}<35\) GeV. The \(z\) component of the neutrino present in the event is reconstructed starting from the lepton and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and imposing the \(W\)-boson mass constraint. This analysis is performed only on MC samples including detector simulation. The following variables are investigated:

* the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the untagged jet (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}(j)\)),
* the mass of the system created by the lepton, the neutrino and the \(b\)-tagged jet (\(m(\ell\nu b)\)),
* the transverse \(W\) mass (\(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\)),* the azimuthal difference between the untagged jet and the system created by the lepton, the neutrino and the \(b\)-tagged jet (\(\Delta\phi(j,\ell\nu b)\)).

## 4 Matching uncertainty

The systematic uncertainty on the matching of the NLO ME generation and the PS explores the possible methods to remove double-counting or holes in the radiation phase space. As a consequence, this uncertainty affects observables sensitive to the leading additional emissions such as the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of jets not coming from the top-quark decay, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the \(t\bar{t}\) system, or the number of jets present in the event. Variables that are not directly related to the number or energy of the emissions should be only slightly affected by the matching procedure, e.g. the mass of the \(t\bar{t}\) system, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the top-quark, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the top-quark decay products.

In this section, comparisons of the observables described in Section 3 between Powheg+Pythia 8 with different values of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8 are shown for \(t\bar{t}\) production (Section 4.1), associated \(tW\) production (Section 4.4) and \(t\)-channel single top-quark production (Section 4.5).

### Variations of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) for \(t\bar{t}\)

In Figures 1 and 2, prediction from the various generators are compared for observables related to leading and sub-leading additional radiation, which are expected to sensitive to the matching. These distributions are evaluated using the analyses TTBAR3 and TTBAR4. In Figures 3, the same analyses are employed to display observables that are not expected to be sensitive to the matching. Other observables, that are not expected to show a large sensitivity to the matching are displayed at detector level using the analysis DL_TTBAR1 in Figure 4. Figure 5 shows the normalised differential cross section and the number of events as a function of the number of jets or additional jets for 3 different analyses: TTBAR3, TTBAR4 and DL_TTBAR1.

In many of the observables, there exist large differences between the Powheg+Pythia 8 predictions and the prediction from MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8, that generally exceed the differences due to the variations in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) parameter. The exceptions are shown in Figures 1 and 2, where large differences can be observed between the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) variations. This behavior confirms the sensitivity of this parameter to the matching, given that the variations of this parameter have a substantial effect only on observables sensitive to the interplay between the hard-scattering and the parton-shower. Looking at the observables sensitive to the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) variations, the value that seems to give a better description of the data is \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) = 1, as is clearly shown in Figures 1(b) and 2(a). Also the number of additional jets, displayed in Figure 5, shows a better agreement with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) = 1 than \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) = 2, even if both variations are unable to describe the data at high jet multiplicity.

Leading \(b\)-jet \(p_{T}\) and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), displayed in Figure 4, show a distinct difference between Powheg+Pythia 8 and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8 that can be connected to the different description of the top-quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), given by the two generators. As shown in Figure 3(c) there are some tensions on this observable between the data and the Powheg+Pythia 8 predictions, that are not covered by the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) variations. More details on this effect and how it should be covered by a systematic uncertainty are given in section 5.2.

### Comparison with \(h_{\text{damp}}\) variations for \(t\bar{t}\)

Additional radiation in the event generation of Powheg+Pythia 8 is also regulated by the Powheg parameter \(h_{\text{damp}}\) and thus consequently related to the \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{hard}}\) parameter, that effectively regulates the space in which the Pythia 8.230 radiation can take place. This section investigates the effects on several variables of changing the \(h_{\text{damp}}\) and \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{hard}}\) parameter. Only \(t\bar{t}\) particle-level events are used for this comparison, exploiting analyses TTBAR3 and TTBAR4. The value of \(h_{\text{damp}}\) employed in ATLAS and the relative uncertainty have been tuned to ATLAS \(t\bar{t}\) data [66].

In Figure 6, the variables \(p_{\text{T}}^{t\bar{t}}\), \(H_{T}^{t\bar{t}+jets}\), \(N^{\text{extrajets}}\) and \(p_{\text{T}}^{t,\text{had}}\) are shown. Both \(h_{\text{damp}}\) and \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{hard}}\) variations affect these observables, but in different ways. In general, \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{hard}}\) =1 tends to improve the agreement with the data, while \(h_{\text{damp}}\) =3 worsen it, with the exception of the \(N^{\text{extrajets}}\) distribution. Figure 7 show a different set of observables where only \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{hard}}\) or \(h_{\text{damp}}\) variations have an impact. While the variation of the \(h_{\text{damp}}\) parameter affects the mass of the \(t\bar{t}\) system, this variable appears insensitive to the \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{hard}}\) variation. By contrast, the \(p_{\text{T}}\) of the sub-leading jet appears to be very sensitive to the choice of \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{hard}}\).

As a conclusion, it appears that the two parameters, even if related, affect different aspects of the generation and impact the events in different ways.

### Variations of the \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{def}}\) parameter for \(t\bar{t}\)

In order to re-visit the \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{def}}\) setting used in ATLAS [67] variations of this parameters are studied in Figure 8 showing \(p_{\text{T}}^{t\bar{t}}\), \(p_{\text{out}}^{t,\text{had}}\) and \(N^{\text{extrajets}}\) obtained with the analysis TTBAR3. The \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{def}}\) variations have a large effect on these variables and are generally worsening the agreement with the data compared to the nominal and \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{hard}}\) variations.

### Variations of \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{hard}}\) for the associated \(tW\) production

Figures 9 and 10 show a comparison between Powheg+Pythia 8 with the different \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{hard}}\) variations and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8 for kinematic observables of the decay products of the top quark and \(W\) boson or the additional light and \(b\)-tagged jets in the event. Among the investigated observables, those depicted in Figure 9 exhibit the greatest sensitivity to the variations in \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{hard}}\). These observables are the same ones showing high sensitivity to the differences among the \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{hard}}\) variations in the \(t\bar{t}\) process, see Section 4.1 and are expected to behave similarly in the \(tW\) channel. For this set of observables the effect of the \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{hard}}\) =2 variation has a similar size, but in opposite direction, with respect to MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8, while \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{hard}}\) =1 is closer to the default setting. In the observables shown in Figure 10, a small change compared to the nominal is seen for the \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{hard}}\) variations, while significant differences are observed between the nominal and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8.

## 5 Additional uncertainties

Dedicated scale and parton-shower uncertainties are considered in the modelling of top processes to cover ambiguities, algorithmic differences and missing higher order effects in the parton-shower generator [13]. However, some effects covered by the comparison between PowhegBox+Pythia 8 and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8 are not included in any component of the existing set of uncertainties. The exclusion of this comparison thanks to the introduction of the new prescription for the matching uncertainty described here necessitates an in-depth examination of these effects. The two largest effects are the description of the top-quark decay and the modelling of the top-quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), that will be described in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 respectively.

### Studies on the top decay lineshape

Both PowhegBox+Pythia 8 and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8 adopt similar approaches for the decay of the top-quark, based on the Frixione, Laenen, Motylinski, and Webber method described in Ref. [25]. This method builds upon the narrow width approximation, which is based on the separation of intermediate heavy resonance production and its decay, while preserving all production spin correlation effects in the soft-collinear region with leading order accuracy and in all other phase space regions with next-to-leading order accuracy. This method also accounts for off-shell effects by smearing the mass of undecayed particles according to a Breit-Wigner (BW) distribution, followed by reshuffling the momenta of other particles in the event to ensure energy and momentum conservation. The differences between the two methods stem from the approach taken for the momentum reshuffling and the smearing. The top-quark decay in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8 utilizes the MadSpin[26] tool, while the method employed in PowhegBox is described in Ref. [68]. These differences should be visible in the shape of the top-quark mass distribution (lineshape).

To isolate the lineshape effects and verify the effects of the differences between the PowhegBox and MadSpin approaches on particle-level and detector-level observables, an additional sample has been generated using Powheg for hard-scatter generation, MadSpin for heavy resonance decay, and Pythia 8 for parton shower and hadronization. This setup is designed to differ with respect to the nominal Powheg+Pythia 8 only in the way it generate the top-quark lineshape, all the other aspects of the event generation should be the same.

Figure 13 show the top-quark and \(t\bar{t}\) masses prior to any decay, showering, selection, or reconstruction effects, obtained using the PL_TTBAR analysis. These observables should be insensitive to any difference between Powheg+Pythia 8 and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8, beyond the generation of the lineshape. The plots show a large difference between the samples which use MadSpin for the decay and those which use the PowhegBox method. The two distributions differ across the whole \(m_{t}\) spectrum, with the Powheg+Pythia 8 prediction shifted toward lower values of \(m_{t}\) compared to MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8. These figures also validate the Powheg+MadSpin +Pythia 8 sample, showing that it reproduces the shape of MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8 setup and can then be used to estimate the impact of the difference of the lineshape on detector level and particle level distributions. This is not possible using the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8 sample, due to the multiple differences with Powheg+Pythia 8. Figure 13 shows the comparison between the different generator configuration in the \(m_{t}\) range corresponding to 5 times the top-quark width, here it can be seen that the differences reach a maximum of30%. These differences correspond to a difference in the mean of the Powheg+MadSpin +Pythia 8 and Powheg+Pythia 8 histograms of 90 MeV.

Figures 14 and 15 show the comparisons between the different generators and the data on several particle-level observables defined in a final state including one or two charged leptons. The sample obtained with Powheg+MadSpin +Pythia 8 differs largely from the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8 sample, being closer to Powheg+Pythia 8 in all distributions. This demonstrates that the comparison between MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8 and PowhegBox+Pythia 8 mixes several different aspects of the generation, beyond the lineshape. The differences between Powheg+Pythia 8 and Powheg+MadSpin +Pythia 8 are visible in distributions related to the top and \(t\bar{t}\) masses and the correlation between the spin of the two top quarks: \(m^{e\mu}\), \(\Delta\phi^{e\mu}\) in Figure 14 and the first bin of \(m^{t\bar{t}}\) in Figure 15. Figures 16 show comparisons between the various configurations on observables defined at detector level, here it is observed that while the effect on the leading \(b\)-jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the number of jets is mild (\(<1\%\)), the tail of the \(m_{lb}\) distribution (Figure 16(c)) is sensitive to the differences between Powheg+Pythia 8 and PowhegMadSpin 8, with differences of the order of 5%. This variable is frequently employed in the extraction of the top-quark mass [69].

Figure 17 presents an additional test that has been conducted to estimate the sensitivity to the difference between Powheg+Pythia 8 and Powheg+MadSpin +Pythia 8 in top-quark mass analyses. The two samples are compared for the top-quark mass reconstructed at the particle level, using analysis TTBAR6. Here it can be observed that even if the effect in the tail are smaller compared to the parton level plot, see Figure 13(b), the shift of the peak is more pronounced leading to a 190 MeV shift between the mean of the two generator setup. In the Powheg+MadSpin +Pythia 8 sample the mass of the system formed by the W boson and the \(b\)-quark, originated by the decay of the top-quark, always has a mass larger than the parent top-quark mass. This difference has been traced to the treatment of the \(b\)-quark in the decay, which is considered massless by MadSpin and massive by Pythia 8 in the showering. This results in corrections that slightly break the energy conservation. For this reason, the particle level top-quark mass, reconstructed starting from the decay products, shifts toward higher values with respect to the Powheg+Pythia 8 setup.

The comparison of the Powheg+Pythia 8 and Powheg+MadSpin +Pythia 8 samples can consequently be used to estimate the uncertainty due to lineshape effects in analyses that aren't highly sensitive to \(m_{t}\) or to employ events highly sensitive to the off-shell region of top-quark production (\(m_{t}<160\) GeV or \(m_{t}>180\) GeV). A better estimate of the uncertainty due to the lineshape on the current Powheg+Pythia 8 nominal could be derived by comparing this setup with a more advanced generator [63, 70], that incorporates off-shell effects without approximations. Moreover, the usage of this sample as nominal prediction would remove the need for a lineshape uncertainty. However, conducting a detailed study on this generator falls beyond the scope of this document.

### Top-quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) mis-modelling

Several measurements from ATLAS and CMS of the production of top-quark pairs, as a function of their kinematic variables, have observed a mis-modelling of the top-quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)[71, 72, 61]. The predictions from Powheg+Pythia 8 estimate a harder spectrum than what is observed in the data. This effect is particularly evident for measurements focusing on the phase space region where the top-quark is produced with high transverse momentum (e.g., TTBAR4). In this region, the mis-modelling results in a normalisation difference between the data and the predictions within the fiducial phase space that ranges between 15% and 50% depending on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the top quark. The poor modelling of the top-quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) also affects all the decay products of the top-quark, the neutrinos, leptons, light jets, and \(b\)-jets. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum of these objects exhibits a similar trend in the agreement with several NLO+PS generators as the top-quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The mis-modelling appears to be related to the absence of higher-order corrections that would soften the top-quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum.

This disagreement may bias analyses sensitive to the normalisation of the \(t\bar{t}\) prediction, as searches treating \(t\bar{t}\) as background, or analyses extrapolating the measurement outside of the region measured in the detector. An inclusive \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section measurements, for example, would be dependent on the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) requested. These analyses need an uncertainty to cover the disagreement.

Figure 13: Normalised differential cross-section for \(t\bar{t}\) production as a function of (a) and (b) \(m_{t}\) and (c) \(m_{t\bar{t}}\) for the PL_TTBAR5 analysis. The bottom pad shows the ratios between PowhegBox+Pythia 8 predictions with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) =1, MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8, PowhegBox+MadSpin +Pythia 8 and the nominal PowhegBox+Pythia 8. The Pwg+Py8 and Pwg+MadSpin+Py8 predictions employ \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) = 0. The statistical uncertainty on the different predictions is included in the plot, but smaller than the line width.

Compared to Powheg+Pythia 8, MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8 provides a better description of the top-quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). Although the comparison between the two generators covers the effects of the mis-modelling, the introduction of the matching uncertainty definition based on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) necessitates the development of a new strategy to address the mis-modelling of the top-quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). A new sample is obtained by reweighting Powheg+Pythia 8 using weights derived from an NNLO calculation [73] for \(t\bar{t}\) production, which considers the mass and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the \(t\bar{t}\) system [74].

Figure 14: Normalised differential cross-section for \(t\bar{t}\) production as a function of Lepton (a) \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), (b) \(m^{e\mu}\) and (c) \(\Delta\phi^{e\mu}\) using the TTBAR2 analysis. The bottom pad shows the ratios between PowhegBox+Pythia 8 predictions with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) =1, MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8, PowhegBox+MadSpin +Pythia 8, the nominal PowhegBox+Pythia 8 and the data. The Pwg+Py8 and Pwg+MadSpin+Py8 predictions employ \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) = 0. The yellow band represents the uncertainty on the measured data.

Figures 18-20 illustrate the agreement between the data and the predictions for variables correlated with the top-quark \(p_{\rm T}\) in \(t\bar{t}\) production using analyses TTBAR2, TTBAR4 and TTBAR3. These figures demonstrate that variations in \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm hard}\) only have a minimal impact on the top-quark \(p_{\rm T}\) spectrum, while both the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8 and NNLO reweighted samples significantly improve the agreement with the data. In the boosted topology, the NNLO reweighted sample also predicts an overall normalisation that agrees with the data, contrary to the nominal PowhegBox+Pythia 8, as can be seen in Figure 18. The reweighted sample also includes information on the top \(p_{\rm T}\) and the \(t\bar{t}\) mass

at NNLO, therefore the agreement on these and correlated quantities also improves, as can be seen in Figures 18, 19, 20, 20, 20.

Figures 21 present a comparison of various predictions for variables where the impact of the NNLO reweighting is minimal. However, a significant difference still persists between Powheg+Pythia 8 and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8 simulations. These plots illustrate that the comparison between PowhegBox+Pythia 8 and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia 8 encompasses several aspects beyond just the different shape of the top \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). As a result, it becomes crucial to address the top \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) mis-modeling by devising a more tailored uncertainty assessment. This can be achieved by comparing the nominal PowhegBox+Pythia 8 sample with the NNLO reweighted sample. This reweighted sample can also be

The Pwg+Py8 and Pwg+MadSpin+Py8 predictions employ \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) = 0. The statistical uncertainty on the MC samples is represented as vertical bars.

used as nominal prediction in analyses particularly affected by this mismodelling, in this case the same reweighting approach must also be applied to all the alternative samples employed to estimate the modelling uncertainties and uncertainties on the reweighting procedure need also to be considered.

This uncertainty defined in this section doesn't cover an ambiguity in the event generation of the NLO+PS sample, therefore it shouldn't be considered as an uncertainty on the prediction. However the reweighting can be used to avoid biasing the results in cases where the predicted distribution of a certain observable should a agree with the measured distribution.

### Higher order predictions including parton shower

The uncertainty discussed in the previous session is mainly the result of missing higher order effects in the ME+PS prediction. This deficit could be overcome by the introduction of a consistent NNLO+PS prediction, which obviously would make the reweighting unnecessary. However it is expected that the matching to the PS is much more involved as for NLO+PS configurations. Studies are currently ongoing to deploy as nominal prediction a sample generated interfacing MiNNLO with Pythia 8[75]. This sample should reach the full NNLO precision in QCD in the hard-scatter. The matching settings between the parton shower and MiNNLO are being tested, as shown in Figure 22. Here the higher-order MiNNLO prediction using 3 different settings of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{def}}\) parameters are compared to the nominal NLO+PS and NNLO reweighted Powheg+Pythia 8 samples. The settings in the three samples are:

Figure 22 show that the MiNNLO sample is generally able to improve the agreement with the data, especially on observables such as top-quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (Figure 22(a)), which is poorly modelled by the nominal prescription, and the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the \(t\bar{t}\) system (Figure 22(b)), for which the modelling of a NLO generator is effectively at LO since an extra jet is required to produce non-zero values. The \(N^{\mathrm{extrajets}}\) distribution show the importance of the parton shower setting in properly describing the data; here the (s3) setup is providing a much better description of the data. Figures 22 also illustrate the difference between a full NNLO generator and the NLO+PS prediction reweighted at NNLO.

Figure 22: Normalised differential cross-section for \(t\bar{t}\) production as a function of (a) the leading top-quark \(p_{\rm T}\), (b) the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the \(t\bar{t}\) system, and (c) the number of additional jets measured with the analysis TTBAR3. The bottom pad shows the ratios of the nominal NLO PowhegBox+Pythia 8 prediction, the NNLO reweighted sample, and the three different MiNNLO setups with respect to the data. MiNNLO (s1) corresponds to matching settings pTdef = 1, pTHard = 0, (s2) corresponds to pTdef = 2, pTHard = 0, and (s3) corresponds to pTdef = 1, pTHard = 1. The yellow band represents the uncertainty on the measured data, the statistical uncertainty on the MC samples is represented as vertical bars.

## 6 Conclusions

An alternative approach to evaluating the matching uncertainty in top-quark processes was investigated, aiming to supplant the methodology employed by ATLAS during Run2, which involved the comparison of two distinct generators for the hard-scatter: Powheg and MC@NLO.

The new prescription is based on the variation of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) parameter within Pythia 8, a parameter regulating the phase-space boundaries for the parton shower radiation and suggested by Pythia 8 developers as a valid approach to estimate the matching uncertainty. Variations of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) parameter are compared on a range of observables employing events from \(t\bar{t}\), \(tW\) and single top \(t\)-channel production. Notably, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) parameter exhibits significant influence solely on observables particularly susceptible to the matching between the hard-scatter and the parton shower, such as the number of jets and the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the \(t\bar{t}\) system. This new approach tailor the uncertainty exclusively to the matching aspect of the MC generation. This stands in contrast to the Powheg +Pythia versus MC@NLO +Pythia comparison, which mixed together several differences between the two configurations, partially already covered by other uncertainties associated to the top-quark modelling. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}=1\) variation is chosen to estimate the uncertainty in comparison to the nominal \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}=0\) based on the comparison between the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) variations on previously published unfolded differential measurements of \(t\bar{t}\) production. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) variations are also compared with the variation of the \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) parameter, that is a Powheg continuous parameter regulating the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the emission. While both parameters appear to have an effect on several observables related to the leading extra radiation, there are distributions sensitive to just one of these parameters, for example the sub-leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) that is affected only by the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\) variation.

Among the various MC production aspects covered by the comparison between Powheg +Pythia 8 and MC@NLO +Pythia 8, there are two effects on \(t\bar{t}\) production that aren't covered by other modelling uncertainties: the modelling of the top-quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the decay lineshape of the top quark. Both effects are studied in details and new uncertainty prescriptions are defined for both cases. A supplementary dataset was generated utilizing MadSpin for the top-quark decay within the Powheg +Pythia 8 setup and compared to the nominal Powheg +Pythia 8 to estimate the lineshape uncertainty. Although this prescription encapsulates the uncertainty stemming from the top lineshape, especially in the off-shell region, a more refined prescription is needed for precision measurements, based on more advanced generators that incorporate off-shell effects. The top-quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is poorly modelled by the nominal Powheg +Pythia 8, while the agreement with data is improved by the calculations at NNLO in QCD, consequently the uncertainty is estimated by comparing the nominal sample with an alternative sample obtained with a reweighting to an NNLO+NNLL calculation. This uncertainty, as opposed to the uncertainty on the matching procedure, doesn't cover an ambiguity in the event generation and it is not intended as an uncertainty on the prediction itself, it has the only purpose to avoid biases in analyses affected by the top-quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) mismodelling. This uncertainty could be overcome by using a nominal generator that reaches NNLO precision in the hard-scatter. Preliminary comparisons between such a generator and unfolded \(t\bar{t}\) data are presented including several settings of the matching parameters. These comparisons show an improved description of top-quark and \(t\bar{t}\)\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) compared to the nominal Powheg +Pythia 8 prediction.
