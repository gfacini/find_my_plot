## 1 Introduction

This note describes the organization and the various elements of the Liquid Argon Slow Control System, known as LARG DCS (for Detected Control System). Section 2 lists the various elements to monitor, and Section 3 shows the general organization of the LARG DCS. The control of the various items is described in detail in Section 4. Section 5 summarizes the number of probes, connections, frontend board location, and finally Section 6 addresses the next steps.

### Situation at the TDR period

The LARG Technical Design Report (TDR) has been released at the end of 1996 [7-1]. A lot of effort had been put in the description of the various probes needed to perform the Slow Control, but very few had been done to integrate the system in a ATLAS wide approach, especially because this approach was not clearly defined at the time of the TDR.

### Evolution since the TDR

Since the release of the various ATLAS systems TDRs, the Collaboration has put a lot of effort in trying to have a uniform approach across the various detectors. This attitude has been driven by cost and manpower issues, and is described in detail in Section 3. Of course full flexibility is left to the detectors in the choice of the probes and individual controls, which are actually used as inputs in defining and tuning the general framework. These various elements are listed in the following Section.

Since May 1997, The LARG DCS activity is organized around a Steering Group, gathering the experts from the various items to monitor, and the coordinator of the ATLAS DCS activity.

### Electronics calibration

One of the first decisions of the LARG DCS Steering Group has been to decouple the electronics calibration from the DCS tasks, essentially for reasons of safety and robustness. The SPAC link is dedicated to download calibration configuration information from the Read-out Crate to the FrontEnd Crate, whereas a dedicated DCS link is used to carry the slow control informations.

## 2 Elements to monitor

### List of items

#### Mechanics

This includes both position and stress monitors. They will be used essentially at the start-up, or during shutdowns periods, to check for the positioning of the detectors in the cryostat and monitor the stress undergone by the detector or the cryostats.

### Calorimeter temperature

This information is essential for the physics analysis, since 1K variation induces a 2% change in the response. The calorimeter temperature has to be monitored every few minutes, with a large enough number of probes.

### Purity

The control and monitoring of the purity of the liquid argon is essential to understand the response of the detector, and to identify accidental pollution of the liquid. The monitoring has to be performed every few minutes/hours.

### Electronics

The low and high voltage power supplies have to be monitored constantly (voltage, currents). In the case of the high voltage, the monitoring of the DC current could be used as a luminosity monitor. In addition, the Front-End crates have to be monitored in voltage and temperature.

### Proximity cryogenics

This part is essential to the good functioning of the LARG calorimeter, and implies many different elements to be monitored and **regulated**, like gas levels, pumps, valves, pressures, temperatures (both for cryostat and feedthroughs). In particular, the temperature information is essential, and must provide a good resolution to allow for a precise regulation (the temperature probes used are a different set than the one used for calorimeter temperature). The monitoring and regulation has to be performed constantly.

### Feedthroughs

Both the temperature and the vacuum of the feedhrus have to be monitored constantly. In the event of a vacuum leak, the faulty feedhru has to be isolated from the general pumping circuit. These probes are located outside the cryostats.

The vacuum control concerns both the cryogenics and the feedthroughs. An effort is made in ATLAS to have a common vacuum system, and control.

### Number of probes

We list in Table 2-1 the various control elements and their number:

(*) _New evaluation taking into account the space available at the feedthroughs level_

(**) _For symmetry between +z and -z it seems reasonable to go from 9 (TDR) to 10 probes_

## 3 General Framework

### Architecture

The general architecture of the DCS, as chosen by ATLAS, is shown in Figure 3-1. It clearly shows three levels, the detector level (in the cavern), the interface level (in USA15), and finally the Operating System level (in the control room) [7-2].

### Detector level

The general principle, which has to be followed by all ATLAS detectors, is to have front-end elements (HV, Power Supply, specific Detector Element, LMB see Section 3.2.1) digitizing the analog informations from the various probes, and putting the digitized information onto a Fieldbus, which collects the information scattered around the detector.

\end{table}

#### Fieldbus

A market survey had been performed by the ECP/CO division, which had selected three possible candidates: Profibus, WorldFlip and CAN. This survey has finally recommended the use of CAN throughout the four LHC experiments, and this choice has been endorsed by the Executive Board in June 1997.

#### Local Monitor Box

The Executive Board, again for reasons of manpower and cost, has strongly pushed for the development of a multi-purpose Front-End board, The LMB (for Local Monitoring Box). This LMB should provide mechanical standardization, and is multi-purpose, i.e. it can receive analog or digital inputs, and delivers digital or analog output which are put onto the CAN fieldbus via a programmable CAN controller, see Figures 3-2 and 3-3.

The idea, apart from uniformity throughout ATLAS detectors, is to develop radiation tolerant LMBs: They should sit in a low dose region in the cavern (e.g. along the cavern walls), making them easy to access and to replace if needed. This approach is found to be more cost effective that launching a radiation hard program for these Front-end boards.

It should be stressed that these LMBs, in order to be used in LARG, must satisfy the LARG requirements in terms of precision and noise. This is clearly linked to the possibility to bring analog signals on rather large distances without losing the required accuracy, see Section 4.1.3.

### Detector level - Operating System interface

This interface is made via LCS (for Local Control Station), which are VME crates containing the fieldbus drivers corresponding to the various front-ends. These LCSs are then connected to the higher level via a Local Area Network, ethernet like.

It appears again clearly that the use of standard Front-end boards, as much as possible, will allow to use standard drivers developed for many users, thus limiting the load on the detector teams.

Figure 3-2: The LMB. Mechanics.

Figure 3: The LMB block diagram.

### Operating System

The operating system will collect the information coming from the various ATLAS detectors and propose many monitoring features, like information logging, alarm handling. For each information (like the temperature of a given crate), basic tools are provided in order to define the range of allowed temperature, the actions to take (like switching off the crate).

Here again, all the ATLAS detectors information will be treated in a uniform way, thus minimizing the load on the software developments.

As for the fieldbus, a market survey is being performed by ECP/CO. The EPICS system has already been evaluated, as well as its commercial version TIS-4000. Other products, like commercial systems, are under evaluation. The higher level protocol running in the operating system is also under evaluation.

### Status

The CERN approach is to have a common architecture for the four LHC experiments. In that respect, many actions have been taken:

Common Project

This group has been set up in February 1998. It collects the requirements from the four experiments, and addresses specific tasks, e.g. gas control, cooling, CANOpen high level protocol, HV controls. This group is investigating different products and should come to a recommendation for the operating system in late 1998.

Temporary solution

It is recommended to use as temporary operating system BridgeView from National Inst. A typical setup is shown in Figure 3-4. It has to be pointed out that the hardware developed by various subdetectors in this temporary framework will still be valid when moving to the final one.

## 4 Monitoring of individual items

### Calorimeter Temperature measurements

About 500 probes are needed throughout the calorimeter, and the accuracy needed to preserve the energy resolution of the calorimeter is around \(\pm\) 50mK.

#### Probes

The probes to be used are standard Pt100 resistors, yielding a resistance around 25 \(\Omega\) at liquid argon temperature. These probes have to be calibrated (by dedicated companies or institutes, or bought calibrated for a higher price). Whereas the probes location in the final calorimeter modules is known, their exact shape and size has still to be defined.

#### Connectics

The resistor is evaluated using a 4-wire measurement in order to minimize the systematics coming from the current circulating in the leads. The 4-wires used will be of the same kind as the physics signal cables, i.e. 50 \(\Omega\) coaxial cables (harness A). These cables go to the patch panel, when any, or to the back of HEC2 (see Section 5.3) and from there are treated as physics cables.

#### Read-out

Current approach

Up to know, the system used and tested successfully in the LARG community has been developed by Dubna and installed in the HEC testbeam [7-3]. It uses Pt100 probes, with 4-wires read-out via a DC resistor bridge, see Figures 4-1. The digitization is done in situ, and the analog part decoupled from the digital one for noise issues. The results given in [7-3] show an achieved resolution of 5mK, with very good stability and reproducibility, see Figure 4-2. The accuracy is not fully evaluated yet, but seems in the range of 10mK. The stability on 10 days is better than 10\({}^{-4}\).

#### ATLAS-wide approach

The idea is to test the LMB concept on one of the most requiring systems in ATLAS, i.e. the LARG temperature control. For that reason, the feasibility of the system has been evaluated in June 1998 in the EMEC cryostat in H6 line. The hardware setup is identical to the one developed by DUBNA in the HEC cryostat, and will use 8 Pt100 probes located at various heights in the cryostat, completed by a reference system. The analog information will go via the Front-end crate through a dedicated board built by Grenoble, which is used essentially to abide by the grounding rules by means of capacitors, and then sent via 30 m long twisted pairs to the LMBs, see Figures 4-5 and 4-6. The setup is described in Figure 4.

The Pt100 had been calibrated in Dubna to 10 mK, and the setup was using a extremely precise probe calibrated to 1.5mK, read-out by a DVM. The first results, shown in Figure 4-3, yield a LMB accuracy around 2 mK, and a resolution of 0.8 mK [7-4]. Figure 4-4 shows the stability of the LMB read-out after one month, without any recalibration. The stability is found to be 0.5x10\({}^{-4}\) and a spread of the response around 1mK. Of course, for ATLAS, LMBs should have a dedicated channel for calibration (typically 1 over 32 read-out LMB channels), in order to follow the long-term potential drift, as well as ageing or radiation damage effects.Work is still going on to better evaluate the systematics, but these results are extremely satisfactory, and give a strong point to the LMB to be selected as the read-out of the temperature probes.

Figure 4.5: The temperature measurement LMB.Analog part: circuit (top), prototype (bottom).

Figure 4.6: The temperature measurement LMB. Digital part: circuit (top), prototype (bottom).

### Position probes

#### Probes

As described in the TDR, and successfully tested with the EMEC prototype, one uses LVDT (for Low Voltage Differential Transformer), which runs at 2 kHz and delivers a current proportional to the displacement. A dedicated chip from Analog Device transforms the produced current into voltage, see Figure 4-7.

The LVDTs need to be calibrated at LAr temperature and deliver precision around 200 \(\upmu\)m on 10 mm displacement.

As already stated, the running at 2 kHz has no impact on potential noise induced in the calorimeter, since the position measurements will be performed outside physics runs.

#### Connectics

The LVDTs are read out using 5 cables, here again identical to the physics signal cables, and reach the Front-end crate, where the monitor board is identical to the one used for the temperature measurement.

#### Read-out

Once again, the LMBs may be used: the Analog Device chip may be integrated to the LMB, see Figure 4-7, which has then to perform a voltage measurement, as for the temperature control. A 16-bit ADC has to be used, and the dedicated power supply needed to operate the LVDT may be integrated in the LMB. Given the LMB accuracy found for temperature measurements, there should be no problem for position measurements.

Figure 4-7: The LVDT (left) and the read-out scheme (chip from AD, right).

### Stress probes

The probes used are standard Ni/Cr resistors laid on Kapton foils, whose resistance varies with the applied stress. The situation is analogous to the temperature measurement, but less stringent, since the precision required is quite modest.

The connects, monitoring board and read-out are identical as the one used for the temperature measurement and based on the LMBs.

### Purity

#### 4.4.1 Probes

The purity measurement system consists of basic monitors made of \(\alpha\)-source and electron conversion sources, embedded in the liquid argon.

It is completed by laser chambers installed by the expansions vessels.

The \(\alpha\)-source and the electron conversion monitors allow to probe different levels of impurities. In addition, the shape of the \(\alpha\)-signal may give informations on the level of impurities [7-5].

#### 4.4.2 Connectics

As for the other probes, the signal can be transported up to the patch panel by using coaxial 50 \(\Omega\) cables. Each monitor uses 4 signal lines.

In addition, to power up the cold preamplifier, 3 low voltage lines (-6V, 0, +12V) are needed per monitor, see below. Each monitor requires also 3 high voltage lines (-3kV, 0, +3kV). The need for both polarities implies to reserve 4 pins in the HV feedthrough.

#### 4.4.3 Read-out

The read-out requires dedicated electronics, i.e. a trigger, a cold preamp, and a fast sampling to extract the shape information. A purity monitoring board is being built by Mainz, integrating a fast ADC, as used for physics signals, and is located in the FEC, as shown in Figure 4-10.

Figure 4.10: The purity frontend board.

### Feedthroughs control

#### Probes

The temperature and the vacuum of feedthrough will be controlled by 2 Pt100 probes (for redundancy), which should provide a modest accuracy, around 1K, and a vacuum gauge (type not decided yet). This has to be completed by a on/off valve for gas pumping. The implementation of the probes is shown in Figure 4-11.

#### Connectics

The probes being located outside the feedthrough, the cables do not need go through the Frontend crate. The possibility to bring the cables at the back of the FEC is under investigation.

#### Read-out

The read-out of the feedthrough will be treated together with the proximity cryogenics control, since it uses the same type of probes and requires the same type of regulation.

### Crates and Power Supplies

#### Front-End Crates

The FECs are liquid cooled, so the water (or other coolant fluid) flow, the inlet and outlet temperatures have to be monitored. It may be too heavy to monitor the temperature of each individual 38 boards in the crate, but the use of two infrared sensors covering the full crate could be enough. In particular, even though the information may go through the SPAC link, it has also to go through the DCS link, following the general DCS architecture.

Finally, the power distribution temperature has to be monitored, i.e. at least the temperature of the 2 bus bars drawing high currents. In addition, monitoring the humidity in the crate vicinity may be important. The implementation of the probes is shown in Figure 4-11.

#### Read-out

The temperatures read-out can be made of thermocouples or using 2-wires Pt1000 probes. The organization is not yet defined: the cooling part could be taken in charge by the general ATLAS cooling control. The crates controls read-out should follow the general solution adopted by the ATLAS DCS. In our case, the use of dedicated LMBs (measuring temperatures, and DC levels) could do the job [7-6].

#### Low Voltage

The choice of the type of low voltage to be used is still under investigation, i.e. linear or switching power supplies. In any case, the individual voltages, as well as the current drawn have to bemonitored. the possibility to switch on/off a power supply from the central DCS has to be foreseen. In addition, monitoring the power unit temperature is needed.

The Vicor company is producing low noise switching power supplies, and the possibility for the company to deliver CAN controllers of the supplies is under evaluation.

All these points concerning FECs and power supplies controls are described in [7-6].

#### High Voltage

The high voltage will be standard and commercial power supplies. Here again, one needs to monitor the voltage and the current quite precisely. In particular, the current information may be used to monitor the LHC luminosity.

The CERN/pool is pursuing a market survey by various companies, which are asked to deliver their equipment with CAN controls interfaces. The JCOP group has also started to collect the requirements from the various subdetectors to get satisfactory commercial solutions.

Figure 4.11: FEC and feedthroughs controls. Probes implementation.

### Proximity Cryogenics

#### 4.7.1 Hardware

The proximity cryogenics is extremely delicate, since it implies to monitor but also to regulate the liquid argon in the three cryostats. Furthermore it should allow pumping, cooling, warming up operations. For these reasons, it is agreed to go along industrial solutions based on PLCs (for Programmable Logic Controllers). These PLCs containing a analog-to-digital converter and a processor may be connected via a proprietary bus, like AB&B systems, or a CAN bus.

The most demanding control comes from the liquid argon temperature control, where a good resolution is needed to perform an accurate regulation. This information will be delivered by dedicated Pt100 probes located in the cryostats. The read-out may be performed by the PLC converter, although it is quite difficult to obtain the required accuracy with commercial PLCs.

A possibility could be to use the LMB as converter before entering the PLC. This would imply, as for the calorimeter temperature measurements, to bring the analog signals away from the FECs.

As said previously, the resolution found with the LMB of 0.8 mK definitely fulfils the resolution requirements.

#### 4.7.2 Overall Control

The cryogenics regulation requires delicate regulation operations, which are quite difficult to implement in the ATLAS DCS operating system. For that reason, a proposal made by MM. Passardi and Rabany would be to have a common cryogenics control room, regrouping cryogenics controls of ATLAS, CMS and the machine itself. This proposal has received a positive feedback from the CERN management and the LHC experiments.

If this scenario happens, the LARG community would then stick to the commercial choice (for PLCS and architecture) made for the general cryogenics control: it would imply a mechanical support from the LARG side to implement and design the various elements (pumps, lines...), and a control support.

The connection with the ATLAS DCS would be limited to the exchange of a limited number of informations (temperatures, pressures...), all the actions necessary for the regulation being controlled from the cryogenics control room, as shown in Figure 4-13.

As said previously, CERN is pursuing a market survey of commercial operating systems to be used by the experiments [7-7]. The recent developments in OPCs allow to interface easily PLCs organized around a fieldbus to these operating systems. It means that the top level of the ATLAS DCS and ATLAS cryogenics control could be based on the same products.

#### 4.7.3 Steps

The first step is to finalize the Operating Manual, i.e. to perform a technical review of the LARG flow diagram. This step is almost finished [7-8]. One can then move to the studies and specification of the process components on one side, and of the process control equipment on the other side. All these steps are summarized in Figure 4-12.

Moreover, important discussions will take place in December 1998 to better define the directions to take for the cryogenics control, having in mind the tight timescale for the implementation in Hall 180.

Figure 4.12: The various steps of the definition of the proximity cryogenics control.

## 5 Summary

### Cold cables

For all probes, one intends to use standard coaxial 50 \(\Omega\)/25 \(\Omega\) cables up to the various patch panels. The cables are standard after the patch panels (pigtails,...). The list of cables, and their types is given in [7-9].

### Number of lines in the cold

The number of lines is summarized in Table 5-1.

1. One uses 4 signal lines per probe, except for the position probes which require 5 lines. (for the purity, the low voltage uses the same path as the signal, i.e. 10 lines/probe).
2. The purity monitor requires 3HV lines, but 4 pins on the HV connector to interleave 1 pin between +3kV and -3kV.

The maximum currents drawn in the cold are 12mA for the purity (from the cold preamplifier), 1 mA for the temperature and stress measurements. For the position, with a careful choice of the probes, this current may be reduced to 10mA. These values don't create any problem.

Figure 4.13: The proximity cryogenics control.

### Connectics

* For the Barrel, the probes cables are brought to the various patch panels as for the signal cables.
* For the EMEC and FCAL, the probes signals go to the patch panels.
* For the HEC, probes signals are brought up to the patch panel located at the back of HEC2.
* The cryostat probes will be connected with flying connectors up to Harness B.

### Monitoring boards

#### 5.4.1 Type

In the present scheme, one has two kinds of monitoring boards:

1. The purity board containing the digitization and pulse shape analysis.
2. The temperature/mechanics board containing only decoupling circuits in order to avoid noise injection in the cryostat.

This approach, as said before, assumes that the required accuracy is maintained by carrying analog signals at a distance - 30 m from the FECs.

A possible evolution would be to implement the multiplexer, which is today installed in the LMB, in the monitoring board, thus reducing y a large factor the amount of control cables coming out of the detector, but implying radiation hard developments.

For the following we assume that the number of channels per board is as shown in Table 5.2.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline

\end{table}
Table 5.1: List of monitoring lines in the cold.

#### 5.4.2 Location in the Barrel

This is shown in Table 5-3, where the monitoring boards numbering slots refer to [7-10]. The crates numbering is shown in Figure 5-1.

#### 5.4.3 Location in the Endcap

This is detailed in Table 5-4 (see Figure 5-2 for feedthrough numbering).

### Situation in the warm

The situation is of course less critical than in the cold, but it has direct consequences on the amount of monitoring cables and thus the space needed at the FrontEnd crate level.

### Volume of monitoring cables

* For the barrel, about 614 probes lines (twisted pairs) and 100 lines for warm controls (mostly thermocouples lines FECs, feedthroughs) to be shared among 16 FECs, which means an average of 40 twisted pair cables and 100 thermocouples lines per FEC.
* For each Endcap, about 1132 probes lines (twisted pairs) and 100 lines for warm controls (mostly thermocouples lines FECs, feedthroughs) to be shared among 13 FECs, which means an average of 90 twisted pair cables and 100 thermocouples lines per FEC.

### Overall picture

The overall picture is shown in Figure 7-1 and summarizes all the points described in the previous sections. It assumes the use of LMB for the read-out of most elements.

## 6 Future plans

### Actions

The short terms actions can be listed as follows:

* Choice of the read-out system for temperature measurement
* Finalize the number and position of various probes in the detectors
* Agree on the cabling & feedthrough allocation proposal.

### Test beam

The year 1999 should see a beginning of integration for the various monitoring elements. This implies to have dedicated LMB for low voltage, crates, position and stress if possible (and temperature if this read-out is selected). For purity, a CAN interface has to be developed. All these probes will be read out using a PC+Bridgeview, and provide basic alarms and data logging.

Concerning the proximity cryogenics, a test could be performed on the Barrel test cryostat in 1999, with temperatures read out by LMBs, and using a PC with basic elements of regulation.

### West Area

The Endcap C will see the first cold test in the West Area in November 2001. Most individual elements will be integrated in the final scheme at that time. Nevertheless, the proximity cryogenics control has to be operational at that time, and almost identical as the final ATLAS one. This puts severe constraints on the choice of the control elements (both hardware, as the PLCs, temperature read-out, and software as the overall control system).

### Milestones

We summarize here the previous points and reproduce the list of milestones as they have been integrated in the list of all the LARG milestones:

1. LMB test for calorimeter temperature measurement June 1998
2. Dedicated LMB for LV, crates, position and stress Mid 1999
3. Purity frontend board available for test beam Mid 1999
4. Overall DCS integration in test beam Early 2000
5. Choice of proximity cryogenics control elements Mid 1999
6. Operation of various probes and proximity cryogenics in West Area End 2001
7. LARG DCS integrated in ATLAS DCS 2003
