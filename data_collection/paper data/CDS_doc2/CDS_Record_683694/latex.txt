In the ATLAS experiment the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger will be used in conjunction with other triggers like the single jet, the single electron and the tau trigger. In the present note rates for various combinations of such triggers are estimated for both low and high luminosities. These rates are dominated by background events from QCD two jet production. In comparison to these background rates, also the rates from processes with genuine missing transverse energy, like W- and top-production and the production of supersymmetric particles are given.

Introduction

Missing transverse energy will be one of the distinct signatures at LHC to select interesting physics processes. Many extensions of the Standard Model include weakly interacting particles which, if produced at LHC will escape detection. Their presence will however be signalled by an imbalance of transverse momentum. Among the basic building blocks of the level-1 calorimeter trigger is the summation of the total transverse energy deposited in the calorimeters. Together with the scalar sum \(\sum\rm{E_{T}}\) also the components \(\rm{E_{x}}\) and \(\rm{E_{y}}\) in the plane transverse to the beam axis are computed in the jet/energy-sum processor of the level-1 trigger. Although the \(\rm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger itself is not included in the basic level-1 triggers [1], it's combination with the single jet and tau triggers is important to allow for triggering on interesting events with low jet or tau thresholds.

Due to the large cross section QCD 2-jet events dominate the \(\rm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger rate at low values of missing transverse momentum. Their contribution depends strongly on the achievable \(\rm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) resolution. This resolution is mainly determined by the the detector acceptance, the calorimeter response and resolution and the hardware realization of the \(\rm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger. These effects have been studied [2] using the same simulation chain as the one presented here.

After a brief description of the simulation in Section 2, the rates for the various processes considered are presented in Sections 3 and 4 for low and high luminosity.

## 2 The Simulation Chain

The present simulations are based on the ATLAS fast simulation programme ATLFAST [3]. The physics generator PYTHIA [4] is used to generate the physics events. With respect to the standard version some modifications have been made to ATLFAST, which are described in Ref. [5]. They mainly concern the response and the resolution of the calorimeters together with a correct description of the longitudinal energy sharing between the electromagnetic and the hadronic calorimeters. The calorimeter response and resolution functions have been determined from a full ATLAS GEANT simulation for both single charged pions and photons in the full energy range of interest, from 200 MeV up to 100 GeV. In the same simulation the energy dependent longitudinal energy sharing in the calorimeters has been determined. Whereas the response and resolution curves have been parametrized the distributions obtained for the longitudinal sharing were directly used in the fast simulation. Random numbers are taken directly from the obtained distributions. It should be noted that all effects of energy losses in the tracking detectors and in the insensitive material are taken into account in the response and resolution functions. The deposited energies in the calorimeters are summed into trigger towers with granularities in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) according to the proposed trigger cell granularities over the full range of pseudorapidities(mainly 0.1 \(\times\) 0.1, except in the endcap regions). Electronic noise is added for each trigger tower, assuming Gaussian distributions with standard deviations as given in the ATLAS calorimeter TDRs [6].

Pileup from minimum bias events is added onto the hard collisions, as described below. In this procedure correct shaping functions of the various calorimeter types are taken into account. The complete electronics chain as realized in the level-1 trigger preprocessor, consisting of a 10-bit FADC with a dynamic range up to 255 GeV, bunch crossing identification (BCID), as well as the data calibration and conversion in a look-up table are simulated [9]. In a final step the calorimeter energies are summed into a map with a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.2\). This map contains the basic energy information for the jet/energy-sum processor, whereas the e.m. cluster processor uses the original maps with a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\).

### Pileup Simulation

Pileup effects due to multiple interactions within one bunch crossing are crucial, especially for the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger, because summing must be performed over large detector areas and, hence, fluctuations in the pileup of uninteresting events degrade the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) resolution. Pileup effects have been taken into account in this simulation in the following way. Minimum bias events are generated using PYTHIA 5.7 with the parameter settings as used by ATLAS for the full GEANT simulation. The number of events per bunch crossing follows a Poisson distribution with a mean of 2.3 (23.0) events for low (high) luminosities. The energy deposits \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) are derived in the same way as already described, and summed up to form trigger towers of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\). Then calorimeter specific shaping functions \(\mathrm{f_{shape}(t)}\) are applied.

The signal part of the shaped calorimeter signal extends over a few bunch-crossings followed by a long undershoot, which extends over 20 bunch-crossings. Therefore the history of previous events to the event of interest occuring at a time \(\mathrm{T=BX_{0}}\) must be taken into account. The contributions of events earlier in time are added up resulting in an effective energy \(\mathrm{E_{eff}(T)}\) for a given bunch-crossing T=BX:

\[\mathrm{E_{eff}(T=BX)=\sum_{t=BX-25}^{t=BX}E_{T}(t)\cdot f_{shape}(t)}\]

This procedure is repeated for every bunch-crossing including at least the expected occurence of the signal maximum plus the three following minimum bias pile-up events to allow correct identification of the interesting bunch-crossing. The energies of the last seven bunch-crossings are written to disk in order not to repeat for every event this time consuming procedure. Afterwards these pseudo-events are read back and can be used in the further analysis.

## 3 Level-1 Trigger Rates at Low Luminosity

### Contributions to the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) Spectrum from QCD Jet Events

The calculation of the inclusive \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) spectrum is affected by large uncertainties, since in addition to the contributions from physics channels, also contributions from instrumental effects are important which can not be calculated reliably at present. Among such effects are machine induced backgrounds, beam gas interactions as well as contributions resulting from extreme tails in the detector performance.

In the present note an attempt is made to calculate the contribution of QCD jet and minimum bias events to the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) spectrum. These events will add a significant contribution to the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger rate given their high production cross section together with the resolution of the missing transverse energy measurement in the trigger.

In order to simulate the total inelastic proton-proton cross section of 70 mb, the following procedure has been applied: in the QCD jet simulation using the PYTHIA Monte Carlo program the \(\mathrm{P_{T}}\) cutoff value, which has to be introduced in order to cutoff the divergent tree-level cross sections, has been chosen such that the total QCD jet cross section corresponds to 70 mb. This cross section value is obtained for a cutoff value of 4.3 GeV. Applying this procedure assumes that typical minimum bias events can be described by low \(\mathrm{P_{T}}\) tree level QCD jet production. Since in any case the contributions of low \(\mathrm{P_{T}}\) jet or minimum bias events to the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) spectrum are small for large values of missing transverse momentum, the uncertainty introduced by using this method is considered to be small. For the low luminosity simulation the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) spectrum as well as the trigger rates have been calculated without pileup as well as with the superposition of 2.3 minimum bias events on average.

The reconstructed \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) spectra at the trigger level for the simulated events are shown in figure 1. Due to the degraded \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) resolution the spectrum is found to be slightly harder if on average 2.3 minimum bias events are added.

These spectra can be directly turned into level-1 \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger rates. They are shown in figure 2 as a function of the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) threshold.

In figure 3 the \(\mathrm{P_{T}}\) spectrum of the generated leading parton is plotted for the case where

Figure 1: _Contribution of QCD two jet events to the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) spectrum with and without the superposition of low luminosity pileup._

2.3 minimum bias events have been added. On the same figure the accepted cross sections of events passing \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) thresholds of 40 and 60 GeV are shown. As can be seen, no events with low \(\rm P_{T}\) partons contribute to the accepted trigger rates for high \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) at low luminosity.

### Combined Trigger Rates: Jet + \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\)

A combination of the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger in association with the single jet trigger is among the basic level-1 triggers of ATLAS. Before the combined trigger rates are evaluated, it is important to establish the relation between the jet energy scale and the level-1 jet trigger scale. Differences between these scales might arise from the different geometrical size of the jet windows, since a cone with a radius of 0.4 or 0.7 is used in the reconstruction while a fixed window of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.8\times 0.8\) is used in the trigger. In the following a comparision is made between the jets reconstructed offline by using the ATLFAST algorithm[3] and the so called level-1 jets.

In figure 4 the trigger acceptance is shown as a function of the reconstructed offline jet transverse momentum. Only jets with a \(\rm P_{T}\) above 15 GeV are used in the comparison. The acceptance has been determined for various trigger thresholds with values at 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50 GeV. In additon, figure 5 shows the ratio between the energies reconstructed at the trigger level to the ones reconstructed offline using the full calorimeter information. Part a) shows the correlation between the ratio of trigger energy to jet energy as a function of the jet \(\rm P_{T}\). In part b)-f) this ratio is shown for various bins of the jet \(\rm P_{T}\). As can been

Figure 2: _Inclusive \(E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger rates from QCD jet events as a function of the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) threshold used in the level–1 trigger._

seen, the distributions are broad at low \(\rm P_{T}\) values, which indicates that low thresholds have to be used to trigger with high effciency on low \(\rm P_{T}\) jets. This on the other hand will lead to a significant increase in trigger rate resulting from fluctuations in the underlying event structure. From these curves, the trigger cluster thresholds have been determined such that the reconstructed jets of a given \(\rm E_{T}\) will be accepted with an efficiency of 95%.

Using these thresholds the trigger rates have been determined. The results are shown in figure 6 for the case where 2.3 minimum bias events have been superimposed on average. The rates are given as a function of the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) threshold for different jet thresholds. Trigger rates for specific combinations of jet and \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) thresholds are also given in table 1 for the case where no pileup events are superimposed and in table 2 for the case where on average 2.3 minimum bias events are added. As mentioned above, these rates have been determined for a threshold setting on the trigger clusters which correspond to an efficiency of 95 % with respect to the offline jets. As can be seen, for low \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) thresholds there is a significant increase in trigger rate due to the pileup addition. This increase is moderate for \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) thresholds beyond \(\sim\) 50 GeV. If instead of the trigger clusters the thresholds of the reconstructed jets are used directly, i.e. with an ideal threshold curve, the rates as given in table 3 are obtained. They can be considered as lower limits for the combined jet+\(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger rates at level-2. The deviations from the true level-2 rates will be smaller the closer the level-2 scale is to the offline jet scale.

### Physics Processes with Large \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\)

Many interesting physics processes with a significant amount of missing energy will be selected through the inclusive lepton/di-lepton and jet triggers. When combining them with a missing energy trigger, it might be possible to reduce the thresholds for those objects, while keeping a high signal efficiency and reducing the background rate. The effect of combining the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) signature of the physics processes of interest with the inclusive single electron or jet triggers will be studied in detail in the next sections.

3.1 Combined Trigger Rates: \(\mathrm{e}/\gamma\) + \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\), jet + \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) and \(\mathrm{e}/\gamma\) + jets + \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\)

First we analyzed the combination of missing energy and electron candidates by generating a sample of \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\mathrm{e}\nu\) decays. In order to investigate the contribution of QCD background to the level-1 inclusive electron trigger rate, a sample of QCD events is also generated following the procedure described in section 3.1. When requiring electron triggers, efficiencies are calculated taking into account the limited acceptance of the electron trigger, i.e. only those events are analyzed containing a generated electron within \(\left|\eta\right|<\) 2.5

The inclusive \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger rates for these samples are plotted as a function of the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger threshold and are shown in figure 7. The effect of combining the \(\mathrm{e}/\gamma\) trigger with the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) signature could also be read off from this figure and is shown for some thresholds in table 4. The rates of QCD background for a sample of trigger combinations when applying different cuts on the missing energy are given in table 5.

Figure 7: _Level-1 trigger rates for \(W\to e\nu\) and QCD events, including pileup, versus the \(E_{T}^{miss\,*}\) trigger threshold for different trigger combinations (EMxI: an isolated electron candidate with \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{e,trigger}}>\)\(xx\) GeV is required._It is important to note that the QCD background rates for the e/\(\gamma\) trigger are higher compared to those given in the TDR [7] and the Trigger Performance Report [8]. This is related to the fact that in the fast simulation - contrary to the full simulation quoted in the TDR -, some effects of the calorimeters are not taken into account in full detail like the lateral shower development, which does especially affect the isolation criteria for the electron trigger. Furthermore, no attempt has been made so far to adjust single cell thresholds and the isolation thresholds within the fast simulation. In order to estimate the uncertainties due to these deficiencies we studied the rates for a set of thresholds (12 to 20 GeV) in the vicinity of those used in the TDR applied to the electron candidates while keeping the isolation requirements the same as used in the TDR. A following note [10] will be devoted to a detailed study of the rate dependencies on these parameters.

The inclusive \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger efficiency curves for the W events studied in this section are shown in figure 8 for some \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger threshold settings.

For the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger thresholds the value of the generated \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) at 95% efficiency is extracted from figure 8. These values are given in parantheses together with the nominal thresholds in table 4, which contains the efficiencies for different combinations of the single electron trigger with the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) signature.

As seen in table 4 the electrons from the W decays are found by the level-1 system with an efficiency of 86 %, when applying an electron trigger threshold of 17 GeV. As already mentioned the limited eta coverage of the electron trigger has been taken into account. Selecting only those events, which in addition show a significant amount of missing energy

Figure 8: _Level–1 inclusive \(E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger efficiency curves for \(W\to e\nu\) events as a function of the generated \(E_{T}^{miss}\) for different \(E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger thresholds._

in the level-1 trigger system (e.g. \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}>20\) GeV, corresponding to an efficiency of 95 % for a generated \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) of 35 GeV), results in an efficiency drop of 4 %, while at the same time the rate of the QCD background events is lowered by an extra factor of 65/19 to 19 kHz as can be seen in table 5. When requiring an electron candidate of 12 GeV together with a significant amount of missing energy (e.g. \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}>20\) GeV), we observe that the QCD background is rejected by a factor of 140/21 with respect to the inclusive electron trigger, resulting in a rate of 21 kHz. This rate has be compared to the inclusive electron trigger rate of 25 kHz, obtained when applying a threshold of 20 GeV. The efficiencies are comparable in the two cases. Rates below 1 kHz can be obtained when requiring a combination of missing energy above 30 GeV together with low energy electron candidates, but then the efficiencies will drop rapidly.

We conclude, that an efficient trigger can be made using isolated electrons and the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) signature to trigger on W decays into electrons and neutrinos using lower thresholds for electrons than for the inclusive electron trigger. Still high efficiencies can be obtained when compared to the isolated electron trigger, but the QCD background rate is significantly lower. If a rate of 1 kHz of an inclusive missing \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger is acceptable, a threshold of approximately 50 GeV must be applied. Although the main trigger for W's is the isolated electron trigger, an inclusive \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger may be used to trigger W decays with an efficiency of 2 to 4 %. Those events can be used in the offline analysis to calculate trigger efficiencies for electron and or jet signatures without any bias and to calibrate the missing energy seen in the level-1 trigger system.

#### 3.3.2 Combined trigger rates: \(\tau\)/had. + \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\)

In addition to the combination with jets, it is also planned to combine the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger with the tau trigger at level-1. This allows for example to trigger on \(\rm W\to\tau\) decays with lower thresholds compared to the individual tau or \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) triggers. Also in this case the trigger rate is dominated by QCD jet events, which give a fake missing energy signature in association with jets that pass the tau criteria at level-1. In order to evaluate the rates for such a trigger, the rejection factors of the tau selection against QCD jets have been applied. They have been evaluated from a full GEANT Monte Carlo simulation for various thresholds of the \(\rm E_{T}\) of the tau [11]. The trigger rates have then been determined from the previous jet + \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) sample by applying the efficiency to pass the tau criteria to each trigger cluster. The results at are shown in figure 9 for three thresholds of the tau \(\rm E_{T}\) as a function of \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\). At low luminosity tau and \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) thresholds around 30 GeV lead to trigger rates in the kHz range.

#### 3.3.3 Top Production and the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) Trigger

The top production rate would be very large at LHC even at low luminosity. In order to calculate efficiencies and background rates a sample of \(\rm t\overline{t}\) events, with a top mass \(m_{\rm t}=170\) GeV, has been generated. The produced top is forced to decay exclusively into a bottom quark and an intermediate vector boson, i.e. \(\rm t(\overline{t})\to bW^{+}(\rm\overline{b}W^{-})\) decay channel which is the only significant decay mode expected within the framework of the standard model. One W coming from the top is then forced to decay into an electron and a neutrino, whereas the W coming from the anti-top is forced to decay hadronically. The presence of the one neutrino in the final state calls for a genuine \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) signature which could be triggered on. A plot of the inclusive \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger rate for the generated \(\rm t\overline{t}\) sample is shown on figure 10. The QCD-jet production rate, which is one of the main backgrounds for the analyzed decay channel, is also superimposed on the same plot.

The inclusive \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) efficiency curves for different \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger thresholds have been analyzed in one of the previous sections. There, for each trigger threshold the value of the generated missing energy has been extracted, at which the efficiency reaches 95 %. These values are given in addition to the nominal thresholds applied in the level-1 trigger system in table 5 and 6. When requiring electron and/or jet triggers, efficiencies are calculated taking into account the limited acceptance of the electron and/or jet trigger, i.e. only those events are analyzed containing a generated electron within \(|\eta|<2.5\) and/or offline reconstructed jets within \(|\eta|<3.2\)

Figure 10: _Level–1 inclusive \(E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger rates for \(t\overline{t}\) events. The rates are plotted as a function of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger threshold._The rates of the QCD background for different trigger combinations, relevant to the top study, have been given earlier in table 5.

Considering the final state decay products of the channel analyzed here, it is clear that \(\rm t\overline{t}\) events decaying semileptonically could be selected by requiring a high-\(\rm p_{T}\) electron candidate and/or high-\(\rm p_{T}\) jet candidates and in addition \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\). We investigated the possibility to apply lower thresholds of the electron and/or jet triggers when requiring in addition the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) signature. Obviously the thresholds should be chosen such, that a high rejection against jets could be achieved and, at the same time, as much of the signal as possible is retained. Table 6 summarizes the obtained efficiencies after the application of different combinations of the jets and electron triggers as a function of the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) threshold. In our examples, we required two jet candidates and/or one electron candidate in addition to missing energy. We have chosen the jet thresholds such (20 and 35 GeV), that an efficiency of 95% will be reached for the transverse energies of the reconstructed jets of 30 and 50 GeV. For the electron candidates the thresholds were chosen such, that the range covers the threshold settings as given in the TDR.

As can be seen in the table, the requirement of a significant amount of missing energy (\(\rm E_{T}^{miss}>20\) GeV) in combination with other signatures helps in rejecting efficiently the QCD background by keeping a high efficiency for the top production. For instance, requiring two jets with more than 20 GeV and an isolated electron candidate of more than 12 GeV results in a rejection of QCD background of 40, while the efficiency drops only by 6 %. If only 2 jets of 20 GeV are required in addition with missing energy (\(\rm E_{T}^{miss}>20\) GeV) an acceptable rate of 3.8 kHz is expected with an efficiency of 93 % for the top production.

### Production of SUSY Events and the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) Trigger

One of the main topics of the ATLAS experiment is the search for supersymmetric particles. The signature of the SUSY events, in the case of R-parity conservation, would be a large \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\), resulting from the two final state LSPs1 produced through the cascade decays of the other SUSY particles, together with multiple high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) jets and high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) leptons. Final states not containing leptons could be selected by considering the combined \(\mathrm{jets}+\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger.

Footnote 1: LSP stands for the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle, which in most of the R-parity conserving supersymmetric models is the absolute stable lightest neutralino \(\chi^{0}_{1}\).

The ATLAS collaboration has decided to investigate in more detail five points in the parameter space of the minimal supergravity (SUGRA) model. In this note three representative points, namely points 2, 3 and 4, corresponding to three different \(\mathrm{M_{SUSY}}\) scales, are considered. The parameters for these three points are given in table 7. The SUSY event samples used for the simulations in this note are generated using the SPYTHIA Monte Carlo program. The generated events go through the complete simulated level-1 trigger chain as explained in this note.

The inclusive \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger rates together with the combined \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}+\mathrm{jet}\) trigger rates, as a function of the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger, for the three points considered here are shown in figure 11. Also included is the rate of the QCD background. The standard model backgrounds have ususally a lower \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\), lower jet multiplicities and less energetic jets.

The efficiency curves of the inclusive \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger for the three SUSY points studied here are shown in figure 11. When requiring jet triggers, efficiencies are calculated taking into account the limited acceptance of the jet trigger, i.e. only those events are analyzed containing offline reconstructed jets within \(|\eta|<3.2\)

As can be seen in table 9, requiring two jets in excess of 50 GeV brings the background rate down to 1 kHz. The efficiency is 78.6 % to trigger on SUSY events of the most critical parameter point 3. If in addition missing energy in excess of 20 GeV is required the efficiency drops only slightly to 76.3 %, whereas the QCD background rate will then be reduced to 0.5 kHz. Requiring two jets above 100 GeV results in a drop of efficiency for the most affected, low sparticle mass Point 3 of more than a factor of 2 to 36.6 %. If instead missing energy (\(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}>40\) GeV) would be required together with jets above 50 GeV the efficiency is kept at 70.3 % while the rate is around 100 Hz as in the case when requiring two jets above 100 GeV. We conclude, that it is favourable to use the missing energy signature with low energy jets to trigger efficiently on SUSY events even at low sparticle masses while keeping the background rate at an acceptable level.

## 4 Level-1 Trigger Rates at High Luminosity

### Combined Trigger Rates: Jet + \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\)

The analysis described above has been repeated for a high luminosity scenario at LHC. In this case 23 minimum bias events have been added on average on the hard scattering process. The calorimeter shaping functions, the complete pulse history and the BCID algorithm are applied as described in Section 2.

The results obtained for the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) spectrum and for the accepted events at the parton level are given in figure 13 and figure 14. Clearly visible is the degradation in the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) resolution, which is reflected by the much broader spectrum. At high luminosity also events with small parton \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) values pass the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) cuts of 40 and 60 GeV.

The inclusive \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger rate and the combined rates including jet requirements are given figures 15 and 16. In order to obtain trigger rates in the \(\mathrm{kHz}\) range, \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) threshold around 100 GeV have to be set.

As in the case of low luminosities the trigger rates for specific combinations of jet and \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) thresholds are given in table 10. These rates have been determined for a threshold setting on the trigger clusters which correspond to an efficiency of 95 % with respect to the offline jets. If instead of the trigger clusters the thresholds of the reconstructed jets are used directly, i.e. with an ideal threshold curve, the rates as given in table 11 are obtained. They can be considered as lower limits for the combined jet+\(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger rates at level\(-2\). The deviations from the true level\(-2\) rates will be smaller the closer the level\(-2\) scale is to the offline jet scale.

### Physics Processes With Large \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\)

Also at highest luminosities many physics processes with a significant amount of missing energy will be selected through the inclusive lepton/di-lepton and jet triggers. But again, the thresholds may be lowered for these objects when combining them with a missing energy trigger keeping high efficiencies and reducing the background rate. The effect of combining the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) signature of the physics processes of interest with the inclusive single electron or multiple jet trigger will be studied in detail in the next sections.

2.1 Combined Trigger Rates: \(\mathrm{e}/\gamma\) + \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\), jet + \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) and \(\mathrm{e}/\gamma\) + jets + \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\)

The effect of combining the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) signature of the physics processes of interest with the inclusive single electron trigger is analyzed again by generating a sample of \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\mathrm{e}\nu\) decays. In order to investigate the contribution of the background jets to the level-1 inclusive electron trigger rate, a sample of QCD events is generated taking into account the enhanced pileup contribution of 23 events in one bunch crossing expected at high luminosities. The analysis follows closely the one described in the previous sections. Again the inclusive \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger rates for these samples are plotted as a function of the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger threshold and are shown in figure 17.

The inclusive \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger efficiency curves for the case of high luminosities are shown in figure 18.

Figure 17: _Level-1 trigger rates for \(W\to e\nu\) and QCD events, including pileup, versus the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger threshold for different trigger combinations (EMxxl: an isolated electron candidate with \(E_{T}^{\mathrm{e}}>xx\) GeV is required_The efficiencies to select \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\mathrm{e}\nu\) decays at high luminosities at level-1, using both the inclusive \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger and the combination of the single electron trigger with the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) signature for different \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) thresholds are given in table 12

As seen in table 12, the electrons from the \(\mathrm{W}\) decays are accepted by the level-1 system at high luminosities with an efficiency of 73%, when applying an electron trigger threshold of 26 GeV. Selecting only those decays, which in addition show a significant amount of missing energies in the level-1 trigger system (e.g. \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}>20\) GeV) results in a 4% drop of the efficiency, while at the same time the QCD background is rejected by an extra factor of 76/45 to 45 kHz as can be seen in table 13. When requiring an electron candidate of 20 GeV

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|r||r|r|r|r|r|r|} \hline \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) (GeV) ( \(\epsilon=95\%\) ) & 0 & 20 (35) & 40 (69 ) & 60 (90) & 80 (112) & 100 (125) \\ \hline inclusive & 100.\% & 83.7\% & 45.2\% & 9.8\% & 1.6\% & 0.3\% \\ \hline

1e26 & 72.6\% & 68.7\% & 42.5\% & 8.2\% & 1.1\% & 0.1\% \\

\end{table}
Table 12: Level-1 trigger efficiencies for \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\mathrm{e}\nu\) for various combinations of \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) and electron candidate’s \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\).

together with a significant amount of missing energy of \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}>20\) GeV, we observe that the QCD background is rejected by a factor of 192/79 with respect to the inclusive electron trigger, resulting in the same rate and efficiency.

We conclude, that also at high luminosities an efficient trigger can be made using isolated electrons and the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) signature to trigger on W decays into electrons and neutrinos using lower thresholds for electrons than for the trigger using only isolated electrons. Still high efficiencies can be obtained when compared to the isolated electron trigger, but the QCD background rate is significantly lower. If a rate of 1 kHz is acceptable, a \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) threshold of approximately 40 GeV together with an electron candidate of more than 26 GeV must be used. Such rates are not achievable with an efficient inclusive electron trigger.

#### 4.2.2 Combined trigger rates: \(\tau\)/had. + \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\)

The rates for the combination of the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger and the tau trigger by adding high luminosity pileup. The results are shown in figure 19, again for three thresholds of the tau \(\rm E_{T}\) as a function of \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\). At high luminosity the trigger rate can be kept at the level of 1 kHz provided that the thresholds on the \(\rm E_{T}\) of the tau and the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) threshold are raised to \(\sim\) 60 GeV.

Figure 19: _Level–1 trigger rates using the combined tau and \(E_{T}^{miss}\) signatures. The rates are given as a function of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) threshold for different tau thresholds._

### Top Production and the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) Trigger

In order to calculate efficiencies and background rates at high luminosities, again a sample of \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events, with a top mass \(m_{\mathrm{t}}=170\) GeV, has been generated. The produced top is forced to decay exclusively into a bottom quark and an intermediate vector boson. In the following decays the W coming from the top is then forced to decay into an electron and a neutrino, whereas the W coming from the anti-top is forced to decay hadronically. In these events the pileup of 23 minimum bias events per bunch crossing has been taken into account.

A plot of the inclusive \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger rate for the generated \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) sample is shown in figure 20. The QCD-jet production rate, which is the main source of background for the analyzed decay channel, is also superimposed on the same plot.

The rates of the QCD background for different trigger combinations, relevant to the top study, have been given in table 13.

Considering the final state decay products of the channel considered here it is clear that \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events decaying semileptonically could be selected by requiring, in addition to \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger, a high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) electron trigger and/or two high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) jet triggers. The aim of this study was again to investigate combinations of these triggers with the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) signature. Again, the thresholds should be chosen such that a high rejection against jets could be achieved and, at the same time, as much of the signal as possible is retained. In our examples we have chosen the jet thresholds such (35 and 55 GeV), that an efficiency of 95 % will be reached for the transverse energies of reconstructed jets of 50 and 80 GeV. For electrons candid

The rates are plotted as a function of the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger threshold._20, 26, 30 GeV) were chosen such, that the range covers the threshold settings as given in the TDR [7] and the Trigger Performance Report [8]. The result of the application of different trigger combinations on the rates of the jet background and on the signal is superimposed on figure 20. Table 14 summarizes the obtained efficiencies after the application of different combinations of the jets and electron triggers as a function of threshold.

As can be seen in table 14, the requirement of a significant amount of missing energy () in combination with other signatures helps also at high luminosities in rejecting efficiently the QCD background by keeping a high efficiency for the top production. For instance, requiring two jets of more than 35 GeV and an isolated electron candidate of more than 15 GeV results in a QCD background rate of 6 kHz and a top selection efficiency of 82 %. Requiring in addition an in excess of 20 GeV would result in a rejection of QCD background with a factor of 6.1/2.5, while the efficiency drops only by 5 %. At high luminosities it is not possible to simply trigger on 2 jets and missing energies, because either the rate will be too high or the loss in efficiency is unacceptably high.

### Production of SUSY events and the trigger

The signature of SUSY events at high luminosities is the same as that for the low luminosities and therefore the same trigger sets could be applied in order to select these events. At high luminosities it is expected that higher thresholds must be set in order to achieve an acceptable trigger rate. Due to this fact the search for the SUSY particles at the LHC design luminosity would be more suitable for the high mass sector of the supersymmetric particles.

The inclusive \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger rates, as a function of the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger, for the three SUSY points considered in this note and for the QCD background are shown in figure 21.

As mentioned earlier, the standard model QCD processes, which are the background source and affect the selection of the SUSY events, usually have smaller \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) values. They also tend to have, in most of the cases, fewer and softer jets. Therefore applying high threshold multi-jet triggers will be an efficient method to select SUSY events. But it would be quite interesting if the large \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) signature, inherent to the SUSY processes (in the case of R-parity conserving supersymmetric models), could be utilized in order to lower these trigger thresholds. This possibility is studied by generating three different SUSY event samples as before but this time including high luminosity pileup. Likewise a sample of QCD background jets has also been generated and been subject to the same set of trigger combinations as the signal of interest, namely the SUSY events. Figure 21 also shows the effect of requiring two energetic jets at the trigger level for the signal and the QCD background rates. It could be seen that by requiring two 150 GeV jet triggers the rate of the QCD background drops dramatically whereas the rate for the SUSY events is not affected very largely. Most affected are POINT 3 events with a low mass particle spectrum, which must have been fully studied at lower luminosities.

The effect of requiring an inclusive \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger or two jet triggers in combination with an \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) signature are summarized in table 15 for some \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger thresholds. It could be seen that in the case of POINT 2 and POINT 4 the requirement of two high threshold jets,

Figure 21: _Level–1 inclusive \(E_{T}^{miss}\) and combined \(E_{T}^{miss}+jet\) trigger rates for three SUSY points 2, 3 and 4, and the QCD background jets. The rates are plotted as a function of the \(E_{T}^{miss\,s}\) trigger threshold._

e.g. 150 GeV and \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\), does not result in a significant degradation of the efficiency, whereas going up from two 100 GeV to two 150 GeV jets would bring the efficiency down from about 87 % (79 %) to 73 % (59 %) for POINT 2 (POINT 4).

By applying the above mentioned trigger combinations to the QCD background, the contribution to the level-1 trigger rate from the QCD events has been estimated. They are summarized in table 16. This should be compared with the reduction obtained for SUSY events. Inspection of table 16 shows, that the QCD jet background rate has been reduced by a factor of \(8\times 10^{3}\), resulting in a total rate of 5 kHz, when requiring at least two jet in excess of 150 GeV. Now, by requiring two jet triggers with a lower threshold of 100 GeV, plus an \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger with a threshold of 40 GeV, we observe, that the efficiency to select POINT 4 events has only slighly decreased, while the QCD background is rejected by a factor of \(5\times 10^{5}\) and is expected to amount to only 80 Hz.

The efficiency curves of the inclusive \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger for the three SUSY points studied here are shown in figure 22.

We conclude, that also at high luminosities it would be desirable to use the missing transverse energy signature with low energy jets to trigger efficiently on SUSY events while keeping the background rate at an acceptable level.

Conclusions

In the present note level-l rates for triggers using the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) signature have been estimated. Together with the inclusive \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) rate the rates for various combinations of the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) trigger with other triggers like the jet, the single electron as well as the tau trigger have been estimated for both running scenarios at low and high luminosities.

The trigger rates are found to be dominated by QCD two jet production. The superposition of minimum bias pileup events leads to a degradation of the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) resolution and therefore to an increased trigger rate at a fixed threshold. For the ATLAS experiment at low luminosity, trigger rates in the kHz range could be achieved for an \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) threshold of \(\sim\)60 GeV. This threshold can be lowered if in association to the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\)-signature at least one jet is required above a certain \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\). For example, the combinations of 60/0, 40/60 or 30/100 GeV for the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\)/\(\mathrm{E_{T}}\)(jet) thresholds lead to trigger rates in the kHz range.

At high luminosity, this rate can only be kept if the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) threshold is significantly raised. Without any jet requirements a threshold in the order of 120 GeV has to be set. Also in this case, the threshold can be lowered if in addition a jet with \(\mathrm{E_{T}}>100\) GeV is required.

In comparison to these background rates, the rates and efficiencies from processes with genuine missing transverse energy, like W- and top-production and the production of supersymmetric particles have been studied. For these processes, it was shown, that combined triggers requiring both electrons and/or jets and missing energy will allow to apply lower thresholds for electrons and/or jets, keeping high efficiencies but reducing the QCD background to acceptable levels both at low and high luminosities. For the W decaying into electrons and neutrinos efficiencies at low (high) luminosites of 50 (25) % are obtained by requiring besides an electron candidate missing energy in excess of 20 (40) GeV. Top production with the subsequent semileptonic decay will be seen by the level-l system with efficiencies of 80 (50) % when requiring electrons, 2 jets and missing energy of 20 (40) GeV. For supersymmetric processes, especially in the regime of low sparticle masses, an trigger on missing energy in addition to the requirement of high energy jets is mandatory, to maintain firstly high efficiencies and secondly low rates.
