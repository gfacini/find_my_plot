**Abstract:**

We discuss simulations of the electroweak production of single top quarks, and the impact of experimental resolution on the signal for top masses in the range of 155-200 GeV. In particular, we examine the sensitivity of correlations among the decay products to resolution and to the mass of the top quark. With the large anticipated yields, this channel can provide information on the presence of new physics, provide a check on issues pertaining to jet reconstruction, and serve as a useful vehicle for mass extraction that should be competitive with that based on the \(t\overline{t}\) channel.

**Introduction:**

The measurement of the mass of the top quark has proven to be a more subtle matter than originally envisaged. Judging from the results from CDF and from DO [1], it would appear that measuring the mass in as many channels as possible, each with different backgrounds and different systematics, should be (and, in fact, will likely turn out to be) an important avenue of search for unexpected phenomena as well as the basis for the precise determination of the mass of the top quark and its decay width.

Electroweak production of single top quarks at hadron colliders has been examined quite extensively during the past ten years [2]. For a top-quark mass of about 180 GeV, the cross section for producing single \(t\) quarks is expected to be about 20% of that for the strong production of associated \(t\overline{t}\) pairs. Nevertheless, the single-top process has several interesting aspects that make it worth studying.

For the case of the LHC, the "\(W\)-gluon fusion" diagram, which involves primarily the interaction of a \(u\) quark and a \(b\) quark (from gluon splitting into \(b\overline{b}\)) to yield a \(d\) quark and a top quark through \(W\)-exchange, is expected to dominate single \(t\) production. Thus, the yield is proportional to the \(Wtb\)coupling, or the \(V_{tb}\) CKM matrix element. (In _pp_ collisions, the yield of a single \(\overline{t}\) is somewhat smaller than the yield of single \(t\), because the analogous first-order contribution for the case of \(\overline{t}\) involves the interaction of valence \(d\) quarks with the \(\overline{b}\) from gluon splitting.) The advantage of studying single-top over that of \(t\overline{t}\) is that, although the latter channel has two tops in each event, it has substantial dilution in signal to noise from the confusion of combinatorics [3]. In contrast, the single-top channel contains, in addition to the top quark, one high-\(p_{{}_{T}}\) jet (from a low-mass quark) and a \(b\)-jet of quite low-\(p_{{}_{T}}\) (typically, \(<20\) GeV/c). All these jets are broadly distributed in \(\eta\), but, as will be seen, the decay products of the top quark are far more central.

We will restrict our present study to final states involving leptonic (electron or muon) decays of the \(W\) from top. The consequent presence of two high-\(p_{{}_{T}}\) jets, one high-\(p_{{}_{T}}\) lepton, and a large missing transverse energy should provide adequate background suppression at the trigger stage. These characteristic features of the single-top topology can also be used to advantage in reducing the expected background from QCD multi-jet events and from \(W+\) jets (as well as from \(t\overline{t}\) production) in the offline analysis. Specific selection criteria have been studied recently, and found quite effective in enhancing the signal relative to background, without seriously compromising the signal [2]. Also, previous studies concerning the handling of the top signal in \(t\overline{t}\) production have been instructive for the case of single top [4].

As with all point-like collisions in hadronic environments, in addition to the interacting partons, the top channels will contain gluons from incident or final-state radiation. This should be more problematic at the LHC than at the Tevatron, and this has to be studied in detail in order to determine the resultant overall level of topological complexity. In this note, we ignore many intricacies that may turn out to be more debilitating than we expect from present experience. In particular, we take account of both detector resolution and smearing from gluon radiation by using rather naive parton (and lepton) energy smearing, instead of relying on full event reconstruction.

**The Simulation:**

As indicated above, our main thrust will be to compare the sensitivity of mass extraction in events where the \(W\) from top decays either into an electron or a muon, with an appropriate accompanying neutrino. In addition, we will require the \(b\) quark from top, as well as the forward \(\overline{b}\), to be tagged with the ATLAS inner tracker, and accept events only when both \(b\) quarks decay semi-leptonically. These restrictive conditions for leptonic tagging greatly reduce the signal, but also remove most of the background [4, 5]. We used the ATLAS-PYTHIA system for our calculations [6]. The goal was to compare the effective mass spectrum of the di-leptons from top (one lepton from \(W\) and one from the \(b\) quark) with the mass of the lepton (from the \(W\)) combined with the tagged \(b\)-jet, and with the full top mass obtained from the tagged \(b\)-jet combined with the lepton and the reconstructed neutrino from the \(W\). We also examined the impact of energy resolution on these distributions.

For lepton energy resolution (\(\delta E/\ E\)), we assume \(0.1/\surd E\oplus 0.01\) for electrons, and simply 0.03 for muons, independent of \(\eta\). This is close to what is expected for the ATLAS detector [7]. We will assume that the energy resolution for jets will be similar to that found by DO [8], which is a somewhat pessimistic (but perhaps not unrealistic) \(0.8/\surd E\oplus 0.18\) that accounts for effects of gluon radiation in addition to detector resolution.

Ignoring the neutrinos from the two \(b\) decays, the transverse momentum of the high-\(p_{{}_{T}}\) neutrino in these events corresponds essentially to the transverse momentum imbalance in the calorimeter [9]. At luminosities of \(10^{33}\), the uncertainty in the missing \(E_{{}_{T}}\) is expected to be 5-10 GeV for the \(E_{{}_{T}}\) values in question [7]. However, because of the presence of the forward jets and the two leptonic \(b\) decays in these events, we take the resolution on the reconstructed neutrino energy to be about twice that expected. Specifically, we assume an uncertainty of \(\delta E/\ E=0.3\) for the neutrino energy in \(W\) decay. We ignore all angle errors, even for the case of neutrinos. The typical uncertainty on the \(p_{{}_{T}}\) of the neutrino corresponds to about 15 GeV/c for a top mass of 180 GeV. We will see that, except for the fully reconstructed mass of the top quark (and the \(W\)), we will not be very sensitive to changes of even a factor of two in the assumed resolutions.

We ran PYTHIA for single-top production, for masses of top of 155, 170, 185 and 200 GeV, and also studied the effect of modifying the resolutions using ATGEN [6]. We restricted ourselves to jet \(p_{{}_{T}}\) values of more than 20 GeV/c for the trigger \(d\) and \(b\) jets, as well as for the leptons from \(W\) decay. We also required the forward \(\overline{b}\) jet to have \(p_{{}_{T}}<20\) GeV/c. In addition, we restricted lepton tags from the \(b\) jet to have \(p_{{}_{T}}>5\) GeV/c and to be within R=0.6 (distance in \(\eta-\phi\) space) of the center of the jet. We restricted the tags for forward jets to energies \(>7\) GeV [10]. The acceptance limits in \(|\eta|\) were taken as 2.8, 3.0 and 4.0 for muon tagging, electromagnetic calorimetry and hadronic calorimetry, respectively. Because two of the jets have large ranges in rapidity, changing the requirements somewhat (e.g., not imposing any \(\eta\) restrictions on the \(\overline{b}\), but just on its tagging muon) had quite sizable effects on the acceptance. Small variations in our criteria moved the acceptance between 4.5 and 7.5%. Consequently, only about 6% of the events survive our severe requirements, and it may be that such drastic restrictions will eventually not be needed. Folding in the branching ratios of \(W\) to \(e\) or \(\mu\), drops the yield to about 1.3%. Now, accounting for the semi-leptonic branching ratios for the two \(b\)-tags, drops the yield by another factor of 10 for both leptons (assuming 0.2 branching rate per electron or muon, and an overall efficiency of 0.8 for the inner tracker, which covers \(|\eta|<2.5\)). For the considered range of masses, the acceptance depends only weakly (\(<10\%\)) on the explicit mass of the top quark.

At the LHC, the expected cross section for single top of 180 GeV is about 200 pb [2, 4]. This is somewhat sensitive (at the 10% level) to the specific parton distribution functions used in the calculation. (There is, of course, a far greater uncertainty in the production cross section because of the ambiguity in the choice of scale(s) in the calculation.) The criteria we have imposed reduce the signal substantially, and, judging from other studies, may not have to be so restrictive [2, 4]. Nevertheless, even with such restrictions, the remaining number of expected events is quite large (about 2000 per year for a run of \(10^{7}\) sec at a luminosity of \(10^{33}\)). Consequently, the mass measurement will likely still be limited by systematics [11].

**Results and Conclusions:**

Figures 1 through 7 display the \(p_{{}_{T}}\) spectra, respectively, for the top quark, the \(d\) quark, the \(\overline{b}\) quark, the \(b\) quark from top, the charged lepton from the \(W\) (\(e\) or \(\mu\)), the neutrino from the \(W\), and the lepton (\(e\) or \(\mu\)) tagging the \(b\) quark from top. The distributions in \(p_{{}_{T}}\) are given only for 185 GeV (using the assumed resolution), unless there is a significant dependence on the mass of the top quark (e.g., Figs. 4, 5, 6, and 7). In the latter case, we overlay the results for 155 and 200 GeV, with the summary statistics corresponding to the distributions with unbroken lines.

Figures 8 through 14 provide the \(\eta\) distributions, respectively, of the top quark, the \(d\) quark, the \(\overline{b}\) quark, the \(b\) quark from top, the charged lepton from the \(W\) (\(e\) or \(\mu\)), the lepton (\(e\) or \(\mu\)) tagging the \(b\) quark from top, and the lepton (\(e\) or \(\mu\)) tagging the \(\overline{b}\) quark. Figure 15 displays the distance in

results from the different mass combinations can therefore serve as a check of the jet energy scale, etc. Clearly, similar considerations apply to other in completely reconstructed systems, e.g., for \(H\) decay to \(b\overline{b}\).

The difficulty is, of course, that, because the distributions for partially reconstructed signals are relatively broad compared to those for fully reconstructed masses, there is additional sensitivity to background. This means that the data sample must be relatively clean, and the background contributions well understood. Even inherent backgrounds, however, may not always pose a serious problem. For example, the di-lepton mass spectrum (not shown), comprised of one lepton from the \(W\) and the other from the tagging lepton from the \(\overline{b}\) quark, has a shape that is very similar to that from the correct di-lepton combinations. In this particular case, the background can be eliminated and is unimportant (at the several % level) because the \(p_{{}_{T}}\) of the tag from the \(b\) quark is far larger than that from the \(\overline{b}\). Naturally, this entire issue has to be examined using detailed simulations of known backgrounds, and, eventually, using observed backgrounds in the data that will be obtained in the initial running of ATLAS. It is our hope that our brief study will stimulate more extensive investigation of single-top production, which appears to be an interesting channel for learning about the top quark as well as searching for new physics.
