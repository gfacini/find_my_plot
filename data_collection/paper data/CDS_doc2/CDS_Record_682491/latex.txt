Introduction

The success of the standard model (SM) [1] of strong (QCD), weak and electromagnetic interactions has drawn increased attention to its limitations. In its simplest version, the model has 19 parameters [2], the three coupling constants of the gauge theory \(SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)\), three lepton and six quark masses, the mass of the \(Z\) boson which sets the scale of weak interactions, the four parameters which describe the rotation from the weak to the mass eigenstates of the charge -1/3 quarks (CKM matrix). All of these parameters are determined with varying errors. Of the two remaining, one, a CP violating parameter associated with the strong interactions, must be very small. The last parameter is associated with the mechanism responsible for the breaking of the electroweak \(SU(2)\times U(1)\) to \(U(1)_{em}\). This can be taken as the mass of the, as yet undiscovered, Higgs boson. The couplings of the Higgs boson are determined once its mass is given. The gauge theory part of the SM has been well tested; but there is no direct evidence either for or against the simple Higgs mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking. All masses are tied to the mass scale of the Higgs sector. Within the model we have no guidance on the expected mass of the Higgs boson. The current experimental lower bound is 77 GeV [3]. As its mass increases, the self couplings and the couplings to the \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons grow [4]. This feature has a very important consequence: either the Higgs boson must have a mass less than about 800 GeV or the dynamics of \(WW\) and \(ZZ\) interactions with center of mass energies of order 1 TeV will reveal new structure. It is this simple argument that sets the energy scale that must be reached to guarantee that an experiment will be able to provide information on the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking.

The presence of a single elementary scalar boson is distasteful to many theorists. If the theory is part of some more fundamental theory, which has some other larger mass scale (such as the scale of grand unification or the Planck scale), there is a serious "fine tuning" or naturalness problem. Radiative corrections to the Higgs boson mass result in a value that is driven to the larger scale unless some delicate cancellation is engineered (\(m_{0}^{2}-m_{1}^{2}\sim M_{W}^{2}\) where \(m_{0}\) and \(m_{1}\) are order \(10^{15}\) GeV or larger). There are two ways out of this problem which involve new physics on the scale of 1 TeV. New strong dynamics could enter that provide the scale of \(m_{W}\) or new particles could appear so that the larger scale is still possible, but the divergences are cancelled on a much smaller scale. In any of the options, standard model, new dynamics or cancellations, the energy scale is the same: something must be discovered on the TeV scale.

Supersymmetry is an appealing concept for which there is, at present, no experimental evidence [5, 6]. It offers the only presently known mechanism for incorporating gravity into the quantum theory of particle interactions and provides an elegant cancellation mechanism for the divergences provided that at the electroweak scale the theory is supersymmetric. The successes of the Standard Model (such as precision electroweak predictions) are retained, while avoiding any fine tuning of the Higgs mass. Some supersymmetric models, such as the one used for simulation in this paper, allow for the unification of gauge couplings at a high scale and a consequent reduction of the number of arbitrary parameters. Supersymmetric models postulate the existence of superpartners for all the presently observed particles: bosonic superpartners of fermions (squarks \(\tilde{q}\) and sleptons \(\tilde{\ell}\)), and fermionic superpartners of bosons (gluinos \(\tilde{g}\) and gauginos \(\tilde{\chi}_{i}^{0}\), \(\tilde{\chi}_{i}^{\pm}\)). There are also multiple Higgs bosons: \(h\), \(H\), \(A\) and \(H^{\pm}\). There is thus a large spectrum of presently unobserved particles, whose exact masses, couplings and decay chains are calculable in the theory given certain parameters. Unfortunately these parameters are unknown. If supersymmetry is relevant to the electroweak symmetry breaking problem then most of these particles will be in a mass range that is observable at the LHC [7] The sparticles with the largest production rates at LHC are those with strong interaction couplings, the squarks and gluinos. Production rates are very large and the discussion then must focus on decay scenarios.

Many supersymmetric models have a discrete symmetry called R-parity that ensures that the lightest supersymmetric particle is absolutely stable. This particle must be electrically neutral and might pervade all of the current universe providing a substantial fraction of the dark matter. This particle could be the partner of the neutrino (sneutrino), but in most supersymmetric models it is one of the four mass eigenstates that are linear combinations of the partners of the \(Z\), \(\gamma\), and neutral components of the two Higgs doublets. These states (in order of increasing mass) are denoted by \(\chi^{0}_{1}\), \(\chi^{0}_{2}\), \(\chi^{0}_{3}\) and \(\chi^{0}_{4}\). The production rates for these particles are small and their largest source is the decay of other supersymmetric particles. Since these so-called neutralinos have no electric charge and no strong interactions, they have very small interaction cross-sections off regular matter. The lightest of them exits the detector carrying off energy and leading to one of the classic signals for supersymmetry at a hadron collider: \(\not\!\!E_{T}\).

Heavier neutralinos can decay into lighter ones via the emission of a (real or virtual) \(Z\) boson. The partners of the \(W\) boson (\(\chi^{\pm}\)) can either be produced directly or in the decay of other supersymmetric particles (_e.g._\(\tilde{g}\to q\overline{q}\chi^{\pm}\)). The subsequent decay of a \(\chi^{\pm}\) will give rise to a (real or virtual) \(W\) boson (_e.g._\(\chi^{\pm}\to W\chi_{1}\)) and hence to isolated leptons. Since the gluino is a Majorana fermion its decay can lead to either \(\ell^{+}\) or \(\ell^{-}\). This observation leads to the second characteristic signature: events with one, two or three isolated leptons in various charge combinations. The final state with a pair of isolated leptons of the same charge is particularly interesting as standard model physics (such as the production of a \(t\overline{t}\) pair) leads to a rate for this that is much below that for an isolated lepton pair of opposite charge.

It should then be easy at the LHC to observe deviations from the Standard Model such as an excess of events with multiple jets plus missing energy \(\not\!\!E_{T}\) or with like-sign di-leptons \(\ell^{\pm}\ell^{\pm}\) plus \(\not\!\!E_{T}\)[8, 9, 10]. Determining SUSY masses and the parameters of the underlying SUSY model is more difficult because each SUSY event contains two LSP's, and there are not enough kinematic constraints to determine the momenta of these. In many cases, it is possible to make precision measurements of combinations of SUSY masses. This is a recurrent theme in these ATLAS notes [15, 16].

What precision measurements can be made is very dependent on the SUSY model and so must be studied for specific SUSY parameters. The ATLAS Collaboration has been considering five points in the minimal super-gravity (SUGRA) model listed in Table 1[11]. The SUGRA model [17, 6] has the minimal SUSY particle content, _i.e._ supersymmetric partners of all the known quarks and leptons, the gluon and the electroweak gauge bosons. Two Higgs doublets are required resulting in a physical spectrum consisting of three neutral (\(h,A,H^{0}\)) and one charged (\(H^{+}\)) Higgs boson. The fermionic partners of these mix with the partners of the electroweak gauge bosons resulting in four neutral (\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{i}\)) and two charged (\(\tilde{\chi}^{+}_{i}\)) fermions. In addition to the parameters of the standard model _i.e._ the three gauge coupling constants, the nine quark and lepton masses and the parameters of the CKM matrix, four other quantities are needed to specify the model. Three of these are universal scalar masses \(m_{0}\), gaugino masses \(m_{1/2}\), and trilinear breaking terms \(A_{0}\) at the grand unification scale. Radiative electroweak symmetry breaking is driven by the large top quark mass. After this breaking, the remaining parameters are the ratio of vacuum expectation values \(\tan\beta\) at the weak scale and a sign, \(\mathrm{sgn}\,\mu=\pm 1\). We assume a default value for the top quark mass of 175 GeV.

The SUGRA model is implemented inside two Monte Carlo generators for p-p interactions: ISAJET [19] and SPYTHIA [20]. Both generators have been used for the studies described in [15], precisely ISAJET 7.22, and SPYTHIA 2.08. The two packages use different level of approximations and somewhat different physics assumptions, resulting in appreciable differences in final-state signatures. It has been therefore necessary a detailed work of comparison and harmonization in order to understand the differences, and to produce'st andard' tables of masses and branching fractions to be used as an input to the detailed analyses.

Every SUGRA Monte Carlo, as a preliminary step, performs the calculation of masses and couplings of the SUSY particles at the scale of Electroweak (EW) Symmetry Breaking, starting from the values at the SUGRA breaking scale of the input parameters: \(\mathrm{t}\,\mathrm{a}\,\mathrm{\beta}\), \(m_{0}\), \(m_{1/2}\), \(A_{0}\), \(sign\,(\mu)\)

First, the Renormalization Group Equations (RGE) for SUSY masses and couplings are solved, employing the boundary conditions given by the radiative breaking of EW symmetry. The output of this part is:

* \(M_{1}\), \(M_{2}\), \(M_{3}\), the gaugino mass parameters for \(U(1),SU(2),SU(3)\);
* Left and right sfermion masses;
* \(\tan\beta\), the ratio of the Higgs expectation values;
* \(\mu\), the higgsino mass parameter;
* \(M_{A}\), the pseudoscalar higgs mass;
* \(A_{t}\), \(A_{b}\), \(A_{\tau}\) top, bottom and tau trilinear couplings.

The two programmes use two different approaches for the solution of the Renormalization group Equations : ISAJET iteratively solves the actual equations, with the approximation (in version 7.22) of only considering the top Yukawa coupling, which gives results reliable only to a value of \(\mathrm{t}\,\mathrm{a}\,\mathrm{\beta}=10\). SPYTHIA implements analytic formulas from [23], which reproduce the output of ISAJET within 10 %. Next, the output parameters of RGE evolution, which are the parameters of a general MSSM model, are used to calculate the physical masses, which are a mixing of the eigenstates, and the branching fractions. Two sectors are special; the couplings of the third generation sfermions, and the higgs sector. ISAJET (version 7.22) only includes one-loop calculation of higgs masses and coupling, whereas SPYTHIA includes the full two-loop calculation of [24]. Typically, the effect of including the second loop is to lower the value of the lightest higgs mass \(m_{h}\) by 5-10 %

The impact of the differences between the two implementations can be dramatic on the phenomenology, as in part of the parameter space shifts of 10-20 GeV in the masses of the particles can open/close phenomenologically interesting decay channels. It was therefore decided to modify both programmes to take into account these differences: the SUGRA evolution part of ISA JET was interfaced to SPYTHIA, and the 2-loop routines of [24] were inserted into the higgs calculation of ISA JET.

The mass spectra for these five points are shown in Table 2. As indicated above, t he mass of the lightest Higgs boson is sensitive the method used to calculate it. The values from both one and two loop approximations are shown in the table. The parameters chosen for Point 5 are such that the residual density of \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\)'s is such that it could account for the dark matter in the universe [25]. Some of the other points are excluded by this effect if the \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) is absolutely stable. If it decays, the constraint is avoided and the analysis presented here unchanged if the lifetime is long enough for it to exit the detector before it decays. The tables of masses and branching fractions obtained for the two generators after these modifications are shown in appendix to this note. The agreement is everywhere very good except, in some cases, for the branching fractions of third generation squarks. Most of the differences have been, however, understood and removed in successive versions of the two packages.

Low energy physics can be very insensitive to the choice of \(A\) as many values of \(A\) can result in the same particle spectrum. The relevant parameter is the value of \(A_{ew}\) as it appears after evolution to the weak scale. Many values of \(A\) evolve to the same value of \(A_{ew}\) due to a fixed point in the re-normalization group evolution. In addition, \(A_{ew}\) always appears multiplied by quark Yukawa couplings. Hence its effects are very small except for the stop and possibly sbottom quarks where it contributes to the splitting of the partners of the left and right handed quarks.

The parameter \(m_{1/2}\) is almost completely responsible for determining the gluino mass. If \(m_{0}\) is significantly larger than \(m_{1/2}\), then \(m_{0}\) is primarily responsible for determining the squark masses. If, however, \(m_{0}\) is comparable to or smaller than \(m_{1/2}\), then the squark masses are determined primarily by \(m_{1/2}\). Unless \(m_{0}\) is very small, the slepton masses are sensitive to it.

While this model may not be the one that nature has chosen, we would like to emphasize that consistent sets of analyses can only be performed in the context of a consistent model. This is because many promising signals that might be clearly distinguished from Standard Model backgrounds in one channel, can be obscured by production and decays of other supersymmetric particles. We may not believe in this model, but the model that nature has chosen will be self-consistent.

Inclusive measurements can be used to determine the mass reach of the LHC in the SUGRA model [18]. Events are selected with jets and leptons satisfying the following criteria.

* At least two jets each with \(P_{T}>100\) GeV.
* Transverse sphericity greater than 0.2.
* Leptons (\(e\) or \(\mu\)) are isolated and have \(p_{t}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2\).

In events with only jets and \(E\!\!\!\!/_{T}\), the transverse energies of the two leading jets and the \(E\!\!\!\!/_{T}\) are all required to be greater than \(E_{c}\). \(E_{c}\) is adjusted to maximize the significance (defined as \(Signal/\sqrt{Background}\)) of the supersymmetry signal. The reach of this jet channel is then shown on Figure 1 as the dashed line marked \(0\ell\). The shaded regions on this plot are excluded by current limits on the existence of supersymmetric particles or by theoretical constraints. The points chosen for simulation are indicated on the figure as large dots. The reach in channels with jets and 1 lepton where the transverse mass of the lepton \(\not\!\!E_{T}\) is required to be greater than 100 GeV is also shown a dot-dashed line marked at \(1\ell\). The inclusive reach in channels with two opposite sign (OS) and same sign (SS) as well as three leptons is also shown. Finally the modes with leptons, \(\not\!\!E_{T}\) and no jets are shown. These plots clearly demonstrate the large region in parameter space that is opened up by the LHC and illustrate some of the many available signals.

The strategy developed within the ATLAS collaboration beginning at a meeting in Stockholm in January 1996 and culminating in the presentations to the LHC workshop in November 1996 [13] is reported in this series of papers [15]++ involves three steps. First, we use a simple inclusive analysis to establish a deviation from the Standard Model. We select events with at least four jets and large missing energy and plot the distribution of

\[M_{\rm eff}\,=p_{T,1}+p_{T,2}+p_{T,3}+p_{T,4}+\not\!\!E_{T}\,.\]

Typically, this is dominated by Standard Model processes at low \(M_{\rm eff}\) but is a factor of 5-10 larger than the Standard Model prediction for large \(M_{\rm eff}\). The value of \(M_{\rm eff}\) at which the signal exceeds that of Standard Model backgrounds provides a first estimate of the SUSY masses. This variable does not provide a very clear separation if the scale of supersymmetry breaking is low (as in Point 3). In these cases the event rates of the production of SUSY particles are so large that the signal will be apparent in triggers that have been constructed to look at Standard Model physics such as top quark production.

The second step in the strategy is to identify characteristic signatures of particles occurring near the end of the SUSY decay cascades and to use these as the starting point for further analysis. This is best explained by an example. Suppose that gluinos are slightly heavier than squarks and that \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\to\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}h\) is kinematically allowed. Then one can have the following decay chain:

\[\begin{array}{ccc}\tilde{g}&&+&\tilde{g}\\ \downarrow&&\downarrow\\ \tilde{q}_{L}+&\vec{q}&\tilde{q}_{R}+\vec{q}\\ \downarrow&&\downarrow\\ \tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}+&\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}+q\\ \downarrow&&\\ \tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}+&h&\\ \downarrow&&\\ \downarrow&&b+\overline{b}\end{array}\]

Such an event typically contains two hard jets from the \(\tilde{q}_{L,R}\) decays, two \(b\) jets from the \(h\) decay, large \(\not\!\!E_{T}\), and soft jets from the gluino decays and from gluon radiation. In this case, one can reconstruct \(h\to b\overline{b}\) as a peak in the \(b\overline{b}\) mass distribution and measure its mass. Then the \(h\) can be combined with either of the two hard jets. The smaller of these two masses must be less than the squark mass and so has a sharp edge that measures a known function of the \(\tilde{q}_{L}\), \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\), and \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) masses. In many cases several such measurements can be made to determine several combinations of masses more or less precisely.

In the SUGRA model, if \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\to\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}h\) is kinematic ally allowed, it has a substantial branching ratio and provides one starting point. This is the case for LHC Points 1, 2, and 5. If this decay is kinematically forbidden, then in many cases \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\to\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) can be observed. This is the case for LHC Points 3 and 4. The endpoint of the \(\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) mass distribution provides a direct measure of \(M(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0})-M(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0})\), and opposite-sign, same-flavor dileptons can be used to identify events containing \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\). Other modes exploited in the subsequent notes include \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\to\tilde{\ell}_{R}^{+}\ell^{\mp}\to\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0} \ell^{\pm}\ell^{\mp}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}_{4}^{0}\to\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}W^{\mp}\to\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}e^ {\pm}\mu^{\mp}\nu\overline{\nu}\).

Given actual data, the third step would be to make a global fit of a SUSY model to all available measurements, including both the precision measurements just described and more inclusive ones such as the jet, lepton, and \(b\)-jet multiplicities and \(p_{T}\) distributions. Such an analysis involves simulating large numbers of signal samples and is beyond the scope of this study. Instead, we try to determine the SUSY parameters using just the precision measurements of combinations of masses. In some cases this almost completely determines the SUSY model, while in others it significantly constrains it.

All the analyses in these notes are based on ISAJET 7.22 [19] or SPYTHIA 2.08 [20]. A particle level simulation is used together with a simple parameterization that reproduces the resolutions and efficiencies of the ATLAS detector [21, 12]. In particular, a lepton efficiency of 90% and a \(b\)-tagging efficiency of 60% is assumed at low luminosity [8]. The \(b\)-tagging efficiency is comparable to that currently obtained by CDF once the geometric acceptance of the CDF system is taken into account [22]. Isolated leptons are required to satisfy an isolation requirement that no more than 10 GeV of additional \(E_{T}\) be present in a cone of radius \(R=0.2\) around the lepton so as to reject leptons from \(b\)-jets and \(c\)-jets.

In the remainder of this paper, we discuss using \(M_{\rm eff}\) to get a rough estimate of SUSY masses. The subsequent notes discuss in detail various detailed analyses [15]. The final note [16] investigates how well the precision measurements discussed determine the parameters of SUSY model.

multiplicity. In addition, since a major source of \(\not\!\!E_{T}\) is weak decays, large \(\not\!\!E_{T}\) events in the Standard Model tend to have the missing energy balanced by leptons. To suppress these backgrounds, the following cuts were made:

* \(\not\!\!E_{T}>100\,\)GeV;
* \(\geq 4\) jets with \(p_{T}>50\,\)GeV and \(p_{T,1}>100\,\)GeV;
* Transverse sphericity \(S_{T}>0.2\);
* No \(\mu\) or isolated \(e\) with \(p_{T}>20\,\)GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\);
* \(\not\!\!E_{T}>0.2M_{\rm eff}\).

With these cuts, the signal for all five LHC points is much larger than the Standard Model backgrounds for large \(M_{\rm eff}\), as is illustrated in Figures 2-6.

The peak of the \(M_{\rm eff}\) mass distribution, or alternatively the point at which the signal (S) begins to exceed the standard model background (B), provides a good first estimate of the SUSY mass scale, which is defined to be

\[M_{\rm SUSY}=\min(M_{\tilde{g}},M_{\tilde{u}_{R}})\]

While \(M_{\rm SUSY}\) obviously should be set by the gluino and squark masses, the choice of \(M_{\tilde{u}_{R}}\) as the typical squark mass is somewhat arbitrary. The ratio of the value \(M_{\rm eff}\) for which \(S=B\) to \(M_{\rm SUSY}\) was calculated by fitting smooth curves to the signal and background and is given in Table 3. It must be noted, however, that for LHC Point 3 the cuts produce a minimum value of \(M_{\rm eff}\) near the crossover. A more realistic treatment of the \(\not\!\!E_{T}\) resolution could be important for this point. At this point event rates are so large that this step in our procedure is not needed; \(\not\!\!E_{T}\) in the analyses for point [26] shown below.

To see whether the approximate constancy of this ratio might be an accident, 100 SUGRA models were chosen at random with \(100<m_{0}<500\,\)GeV, \(100<m_{1/2}<500\,\)GeV, \(-500<A_{0}<500\,\)GeV, \(1.8<\tan\beta<12\), and sgn \(\mu=\pm 1\). The light Higgs mass was assumed to be known, and all the comparison models were required to have \(M_{h}\) within \(\pm 3\,\)GeV of its nominal value (the value at Point 5 was used); the 3 GeV error is determined not be the experimental measurements but by an estimate of the theoretical uncertainties on the prediction of \(M_{h}\) from the parameters of the SUGRA model. A sample of 1000 events was generated for each

point, and the peak of the \(M_{\rm eff}\) distribution was found by fitting a Gaussian near the peak. Figure 7 shows the resulting scatterplot of \(M_{\rm SUSY}\) vs. \(M_{\rm eff}\). The ratio is constant within about \(\pm 10\%\), as can be seen from Figure 8. The mean value of the ratio is higher here than in Table 3 because this analysis uses the peak of the distribution rather than the point at which it is equal to the background. The error on the ratio is conservative, since there is considerable contribution to the scatter from the limited statistics and the rather crude manner in which the peak was found. While \(M_{\rm eff}\) does not provide a precise measurement, it has the advantage of being generally applicable to a broad range of SUSY models.

## 3 Conclusions

In this paper we have outlined a strategy that can be used to systematically explore supersymmetry assuming that it is discovered at the LHC. We have given an example of a global variable (\(M_{\rm eff}\)) that can be used to determine the mass scale of SUSY if nature has chosen the SUGRA model. Such global variables will be used to give the first indication of a signal independent of the type of SUSY model. The production of heavy mass states virtually guarantees that events with very energetic jets will exist. Other SUSY models such as those with \(R\)**-**parity violation [27] may have no \(\not{E}_{T}\) if the LSP decays within the detector. If the LSP decays to leptons, then all SUSY events will have leptons and they can be used in a global variable. If the LSP decays to hadrons, the jet multiplicity will rise and a variable similar to \(M_{\rm eff}\) should be effective.

More detailed exploration will depend on the particular SUSY model. In the SUGRA models, there is a general feature, namely that the second lightest neutralino almost always decays to \(h+\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) if the channel is open and to \(\ell^{+}\ell^{-}+\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) with a substantial branching fraction if it is not. In the former case, this will be the dominant source of \(h\) and it will be discovered in this process via its decay to \(b\overline{b}\) if it has not been seen at LEP. In the latter case the measurement of the position of the end point in the \(\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) mass distribution provides a very precise measurement of the mass difference between two of the sparticles. After first observing one of these signals, one will move up the decay chain to determine other quantities.

The following notes [15] illustrate, using specific examples, some techniques that can be used to determine masses and branching ratios of sparticles. Some of these quantities were then used to determine the fundamental parameters of the SUGRA model some of which can be determined with great precision. The ultimate goal of such studies would be to use very many measurements to make an overconstrained fit to the model, rather in the same way that current data are used to test the Standard Model [28].

The results in this series of papers are only an indication of the exciting physics that lies ahead for the members of the ATLAS collaboration if nature proves to be supersymmetric on the weak scale.
