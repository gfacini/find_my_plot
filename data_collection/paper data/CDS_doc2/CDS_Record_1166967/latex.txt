###### Abstract

Collisions at the LHC occur at a rate of up to 40 MHz, much larger than the 200 Hz storage capacity of the ATLAS experiment. The ATLAS trigger system has the challenging task of rejecting 99.9995 % of the events produced in collisions, while keeping those needed to achieve the physics goals of the experiment. This note evaluates the expected performance of the trigger system in top quark events by investigating the response of the trigger system to single objects such as a muon, an electron or a jet originating from top quark decays. In addition, the methodology needed to efficiently select top quark events in the online trigger system is discussed including methods to determine trigger efficiencies from data.

Introduction

Triggering at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a challenging task. The selection system is required to reduce the initial bunch-crossing rate of 40 MHz down to a manageable 100-200 Hz while retaining and recording the five in one million most interesting physics events. ATLAS has designed a three-level trigger which aims to select these events, with the highest possible efficiency and lowest possible bias.

The ATLAS trigger is largely based on signatures of high transverse-momentum particles and large missing transverse energy. The first trigger level (L1) is implemented using custom electronics and is based on coarse-resolution data from the calorimeters and dedicated fast muon detectors [1]. The level-2 trigger (L2) and the Event Filter (EF), referred to together as the High Level Trigger (HLT), are implemented in software and run on a commodity computing cluster [2]. The L2 design is based on the concept of Regions of Interest (RoIs). Algorithms request full-resolution data only from the region of the detector corresponding to the L1 candidate object and perform a more refined analysis of its features. The EF works also in a seeded mode although it has access to the full-resolution data of the entire detector. It runs more sophisticated offline reconstruction and selection algorithms.

At the LHC top quarks are mainly produced either in pairs or singly. A large set of different and complex event signatures is expected. For \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) events, approximately 44% of the decays will be fully hadronic, resulting in a final state with six jets2: four light jets from the W-boson decays and two b-jets. Another 44% of the decays will be semi-leptonic, with a final state containing one lepton, one neutrino, two b-jets and two light jets. Roughly 11% of the \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) decays will be purely leptonic, with two leptons, two neutrinos, and two b-jets in the final state. In single-top events, the W-boson decays hadronically two-thirds of the time and leptonically one-third. More details about the properties and decay modes of top events are discussed in the introduction [3].

Footnote 2: Neglecting for now initial or final state radiation.

The trigger efficiencies for top events of the most relevant single object triggers are studied in Section 2 of this note. The rich topologies of top events results in large overlap between trigger signatures. This feature can be exploited to monitor trigger efficiencies as discussed in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4, the electron trigger efficiency is extracted from Z\(\rightarrow\)ee events and is compared to the true efficiency in \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) events.

## 2 Single object trigger performance in top quark events

Results are presented for the basic trigger signatures using electron, muon and jet trigger objects, as well as missing transverse energy (\(E_{T}^{miss}\)). The main trigger criteria from the ATLAS trigger tables for the initial data taking phase are evaluated using simulated top quark signal samples. Two types of \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) signal samples are used in this note. The first is the fully hadronic sample with only jets in the final state and the second is a leptonic sample, consisting of a combination of semi-leptonic and di-leptonic events, and will be referred to as _leptonic_ sample in the following. For top quarks produced singly, the s, t, and Wt channels are simulated and only those events which result in an electron or a muon from the W-boson decay are considered here. More details about the data samples are given in [3].

Trigger items are described by a combination of letters and numbers. The trigger object is represented by an abbreviation consisting of one or two letters. It is preceded by a number representing the object multiplicity and followed by a number signifying the transverse momentum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) of the trigger threshold. If an isolation requirement is applied, it is indicated by the letter 'i' after the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold. For example, the item name '2EM18l' represents a trigger on two electromagnetic objects, with a threshold of 18 GeV each, including isolation requirements. The L2 and EF item naming conventions are the same as L1 except that lower-case letters are used. A trigger chain consists of the L1, L2, and EF trigger items an object must satisfy and is referred to using the HLT notation. A _trigger menu_ is a list of triggers enabled during a data taking run. For a more complete description, see [4].

The dependence of a trigger on the actual \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cut will be investigated here by means of _turn-on curves_, which shows the fraction of objects passing a certain trigger as a function of the reconstructed or true simulated \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of that object. Trigger candidate objects are matched to reconstructed or Monte Carlo simulated objects by cutting on \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\) between the two objects.

In the following sections, single object triggers are evaluated in detail first in \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events, and then in single-top events.

### Electron triggers in \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events

#### 2.1.1 Introduction

Leptonic \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) decays will form a statistically large sample of events early on at the LHC. Figure 1 (a) shows the simulated \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum of the electron from a W-boson decay in leptonic \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events. The plot gives an idea of the expected fraction of events the trigger system is confronted with above certain \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) values. The single-electron trigger threshold is expected to be around 20 GeV, indicating that complex multi-object triggers (with correspondingly lowered thresholds) may be unnecessary.

#### 2.1.2 Single electron triggers

The L1 electron triggers operate on reduced granularity (\(0.1\times 0.1\) in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\)) calorimeter trigger towers which cover the range \(|\eta|<2.5\). A central cluster of four towers is formed in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, along with a ring of 12 towers around this central cluster. The ring is used to select candidates using isolation criteria by cutting on the amount of energy deposited around the central cluster. At L2, electromagnetic clusters are formed, tracking is then performed for the first time, and, finally, the reconstructed cluster is matched to a track. In the final stage, the EF, tracking and cluster determination is performed with more accurate algorithms, further refining the trigger decision. More details can be found in [4].

Figure 1: **(a):** spectrum of electrons from the decay W\(\rightarrow\)e\(\nu\) in leptonic \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events. The number of electrons is scaled to an integrated luminosity of 1 pb\({}^{-1}\), and is shown as a function of the true simulated electron \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). **(b):** Turn-on curves for the e22i trigger determined with leptonic \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events. The efficiencies are shown with respect to an offline selection (excluding the cut on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) as a function of the offline reconstructed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the electron that fired the trigger.

#### 2.1.3 Single electron trigger efficiencies

The lowest unprescaled trigger threshold depends on the luminosity. For a luminosity of \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\), the e22i trigger is the unprescaled trigger with the lowest \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold. For the start-up luminosity of \(10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\), an e12i trigger is available. The e12i chain has a lower threshold and hence a higher efficiency in leptonic \(\rm t\bar{t}\) events.

Table 1 shows the fraction of events passing each trigger level in the e22i chain per 100 pb\({}^{-1}\). The e22i trigger chain consists of the L1 trigger L1_EM18I, and the e22i trigger at L2 and EF. The efficiency has been calculated for each trigger level with respect to the total number of leptonic \(\rm t\bar{t}\) events with a W\(\rightarrow\)e\(\nu\) decay and with respect to the number of events reconstructed and selected in the _commissioning_ analysis [5], requiring \(|\eta|<2.5\) for the trigger and reconstructed or simulated electrons. The cuts are:

* At least one reconstructed isolated electron with \(p_{\rm T}>20\) GeV;
* \(E_{T}^{miss}>20\) GeV;
* At least 3 reconstructed jets with \(p_{\rm T}>40\) GeV and at least 4 reconstructed jets with \(p_{\rm T}>20\) GeV.

Also shown in Table 1 are the percentage of events passing each trigger level in the e12i chain. Compared to e22i, a larger fraction of events passes this looser chain at each level, as expected. Note that the large value of the trigger efficiency with respect to the selection, exceeding 90%, is partly due to jets fulfilling the electron trigger. Eventually this effect has to be accounted for when determining trigger efficiency corrections to be used in an analysis.

Figure 1 (b) shows the turn-on curves for each trigger level in the e22i chain, determined from simulated leptonic \(\rm t\bar{t}\) events. The turn-on behaviour of the trigger is sharp at all levels. From the L1 to the HLT the \(p_{\rm T}\) dependence is very similar, the curves reveal a flat plateau once beyond the turn-on region. Note that the slight decrease in efficiencies at large \(p_{\rm T}\) values are due to the isolation requirements of the e22i trigger. This small loss can be recovered using a high-threshold non-isolated trigger, although it has not been considered in this study.

In summary, the single electron trigger efficiency in \(\rm t\bar{t}\) events is high for \(\rm t\bar{t}\) events with a W\(\rightarrow\)e\(\nu\) decay in the current physics trigger menus. The electron trigger chain will be, together with the muon

Note that no matching constraint is imposed between the trigger and the reconstructed or true simulated electrons. Moreover, the efficiencies are determined for \(|\eta|<2.5\) by cutting on the \(\eta\) of the trigger as well as the reconstructed or simulated electrons.

chain discussed in the next section, the main trigger for selecting \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events in the _golden_ leptonic decay channel. Simple and efficient high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) isolated single electron triggers exist to select \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events, avoiding considerable complications in the determination of trigger efficiencies for complex combined trigger signatures.

### Muon triggers in \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events

#### 2.2.1 Introduction

The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum of truth muons from the \(\mathrm{W}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu\nu\) decay in \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events is shown in Fig. 2 (a). As for electrons, rather high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) single muon triggers can be used to select \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events with at least one \(\mathrm{W}\)-boson decaying to a \(\mu\) and \(\nu_{\mu}\) without much loss of efficiency.

#### 2.2.2 Single muon triggers in ATLAS

The L1 muon trigger consists of fast electronics establishing coincidences between hits of different detector layers of the muon system inside programmed geometrical windows. The size of the window defines the transverse momentum interval corresponding to the deflection of the muon in the toroidal magnetic field. One of six programmable \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds is assigned to the candidate. The L2 processing consists of three reconstruction steps applied to full granularity data of the region defined by L1. First, the muon candidate is reconstructed in the muon spectrometer. Then inner detector tracks are reconstructed around the muon candidate. Both are combined to form the L2 muons upon which the trigger decision is based. Currently only the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the muon candidate is checked. Isolation requirements or constraints on the \(\chi^{2}\) of the combined inner detector and muon spectrometer track are not imposed here (but might be in future). The muon reconstruction in the Event Filter is done using offline algorithms. The EF muon trigger decision at the moment is also based solely on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the reconstructed muon candidate. A more complete description of the muon trigger can be found in [4].

Figure 2: **(a):** spectrum of muons from \(\mathrm{W}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu\nu\) decays in leptonic \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events. The muon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is the true simulated value. The distribution is scaled to correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1 pb\({}^{-1}\). **(b):** Trigger efficiencies for the mu20 with respect to an offline selection (excluding the cut on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)), given as a function of reconstructed muon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

#### 2.2.3 Single muon trigger efficiencies

Using the standard L1 muon thresholds, six different trigger items have been defined in the simulated samples under study; L1_MU06, L1_MU08, L1_MU10, L1_MU11, L1_MU20 and L1_MU40. The efficiencies for each trigger item are shown in Fig. 3 (a). Each efficiency is calculated with respect to the number of simulated leptonic \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) events with a W\(\rightarrow\mu\nu\) decay. It can be seen that the high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) L1 single muon triggers provide a high efficiency for selecting the events. When running at an increased luminosity of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\), the threshold could be raised to 40 GeV without an unacceptable loss in efficiency.

Figure 3 (b) shows the absolute efficiency of the L2 single muon trigger in the case of the HLT chain being started by a MU06 RoI. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cut applied by the L2 algorithm is shown on the horizontal axis. Similar efficiencies are shown in Fig. 3 (c) for the EF when the EF chain is started by a L2 muon candidate fulfilling the mu06 signature. The absolute trigger efficiency for the HLT cannot in principle

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline \multirow{2}{*}{Trigger} & Compared to Monte Carlo & Compared to offline selection \\ \cline{2-3}  & Eff. [\%] & Eff. [\%] \\ \hline
**mu06:** & & \\ \hline L1 & 83.8 \(\pm\) 0.3 & 91.9 \(\pm\) 0.4 \\ L2 & 80.2 \(\pm\) 0.3 & 88.7 \(\pm\) 0.4 \\ EF & 73.1 \(\pm\) 0.2 & 83.1 \(\pm\) 0.4 \\ \hline
**mu20:** & & \\ L1 & 74.6 \(\pm\) 0.2 & 86.4 \(\pm\) 0.4 \\ L2 & 66.3 \(\pm\) 0.2 & 82.3 \(\pm\) 0.4 \\ EF & 58.8 \(\pm\) 0.2 & 76.6 \(\pm\) 0.4 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Efficiencies of the mu06, and mu20 trigger chains for leptonic \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) events with at least one W\(\rightarrow\mu\nu\) decay. The numbers are absolute trigger efficiencies, the reference offline selection is given in [5]. The binomial errors \(\Delta\) are calculated as \(\Delta^{2}=\epsilon(1-\epsilon)/N\), where \(\epsilon\) is the efficiency, for an integrated luminosity of 946pb\({}^{-1}\), which corresponds to the available Monte Carlo statistics. Note that the efficiencies are determined for \(\eta<|2.4|\) by cutting on the \(\eta\) of the trigger as well as the reconstructed or true simulated muons.

Figure 3: Efficiencies of the single muon triggers for L1 (a), L2 (b), and EF (c), determined using leptonic \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) events with a W\(\rightarrow\mu\nu\) decay. For the L1 items, the efficiencies are calculated for the six available thresholds. The HLT efficiencies are plotted as a function of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cut applied. In Fig. (b) the L2 chain is started by L1 RoIs passing the MU06 threshold and in Fig. (c) the EF chain is started by muon candidates passing the mu06 signature at L2. Note that the efficiencies are calculated with respect to the number of simulated muons within \(|\eta|<2.4\).

be inferred directly from these plots, as for instance the L2 mu20 processing will only be initiated by L1 RoIs which fulfill the L1_MU20 requirements. On the other hand, the efficiencies for each trigger level, normalized to the number of events with a true simulated muon from a W-boson decay within \(|\eta|<2.4\), have been calculated for a few trigger signatures and are shown in Table 2. Comparing Table 2 with Fig. 3, one can see that the differences are small. Hence these figures can be used to indicate the effects of a change in trigger threshold cuts.

The efficiencies of the single muon trigger signatures have also been evaluated for the events selected by the _commissioning_ analysis [5]. The same cuts as described in the electron section 2.1.3 are applied. The results are given in Table 2 for the mu20 trigger chain, which consists of the L1 trigger L1_MU20, and the mu20 trigger at L2 and EF. The table shows that the mu20 signature is effective in selecting events for the commissioning analysis.

One can also determine the turn-on curve of the trigger efficiency for single muons in events. For that purpose a L1 muon is matched to a reconstructed muon by requiring \(\Delta R<0.15\) while L2 and EF trigger muons are matched by requiring \(\Delta R<0.1\)3). Figure 2 (b) shows the mu20 trigger chain efficiencies for reconstructed muons as a function of their reconstructed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The muons are required to have \(|\eta_{\mu}|<2.4\), as this is the reach of the muon trigger chambers. The L1 turn-on is less steep than those for the higher trigger levels, due to the coarser \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold assignment at L1 than at the HLT. The thresholds at the different levels are set such as to reach the plateau at the same value of the offline reconstructed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). At all trigger levels, once the plateau is reached, the efficiencies remain flat versus \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

Footnote 3): The \(\Delta R\) cuts were chosen after studying the \(\Delta R\) distributions for the different trigger levels.

In summary, as for the electrons, the single muon trigger efficiency in events is reasonably large. The mu20 is the most relevant muon trigger for selecting events with at least one W-boson decaying to a muon.

### Jet triggers in events

Jet triggers are dominated by QCD multi-jet events, which have production cross-sections orders of magnitudes larger than the top signal processes. Therefore it is not obvious that multi-jet triggers giving acceptable rates will correspond to \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds efficient for selecting top events. In order to characterize jet distributions in events, Fig. 4 (a) shows the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution of the six highest-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets (ordered in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and defined using a cone jet algorithm with radius 0.4) for hadronic events as obtained after a full event reconstruction. The characteristics of top events are a large number of high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets. This is expected to provide some discriminatory power against the background, which has a steeply falling \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum.

In Fig. 4 (b), turn-on curves are given for different thresholds at L1, for leptonic events. The plot is obtained by matching a jet triggered at L1 with a corresponding fully reconstructed jet within \(\Delta R<0.2\). The curves reveal, compared to the lepton triggers, a rather slow turn-on of the L1 jet triggers, resulting from coarse resolution at L1 (cf. [6]).

Figure 4 (c) shows the L1 trigger efficiency for different jet multiplicities as a function of the trigger threshold for hadronic events. Single jet triggers will be more than 90% efficient for thresholds up to about 60, and roughly 45% efficient at 100. Table 3 summarises trigger efficiencies for signal and background rates for a selection of single and multi-jet triggers. Depending on how high the jet trigger thresholds are set, the signal efficiency varies between 10 and 100%. Due to large QCD rates, only high single-jet thresholds or carefully optimised multi-jet triggers are affordable. For example, for the j160, a rate of O(Hz) is to be expected from QCD multi-jets already for an instantaneous luminosity of \(10^{31}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\).

#### 2.3.1 Multi-jet triggers for the fully-hadronic \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) channel

The multi-jet trigger item 4J50 listed in the previous section is intended to be general purpose, applicable to a wide range of physics channels. In order to optimize the signal efficiency of the jet triggers, especially for the fully-hadronic \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) decays not accessible with lepton triggers, other trigger combinations for multi-jet triggers are studied. The aim is to identify optimum trigger combinations that reduce QCD background rates, while keeping a sizable signal acceptance in the fully-hadronic \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) decay channel. Therefore, trigger combinations requiring at least 4, 5 or 6 jets for a given set of jet thresholds, were

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Trigger & Signal Efficiency [\%] & Relative Background Rate & S/B \\ \hline \hline
4j60\_2j100\_j170 & 6 & 0.13 & \(2.8\cdot 10^{-3}\) \\ \hline
5j45\_2j60\_j100 & 16 & 0.34 & \(3.0\cdot 10^{-3}\) \\ \hline
6j35\_5j45\_4j50\_3j60 & 10 & 0.18 & \(3.7\cdot 10^{-3}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Set of optimum multi-jet trigger combinations for fully-hadronic \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) events. The QCD multi-jet background rates are given relative to the background rate of the 4j50 trigger (cf. Table 3). Efficiencies and rates at the EF are calculated with respect to the total number of events. Note that the names of the triggers are inclusive, “4j60_2j100_j170” means 4 jets have to pass the 60 GeV trigger, 2 jets the 100 GeV, and another 1 jet has to pass the 170 GeV trigger.

The efficiency is calculated with respect to all events in the sample.

tested.

Table 4 summarizes signal efficiencies and increased background suppression for a set of trigger combinations. As figure of merit, the ratio of the trigger efficiency for the signal and QCD events is used. A strong suppression of QCD is observed when tightening the cuts on the jet energies, as expected. The signal-to-background ratio of the 4J50 trigger (cf. Table 3) is improved by a factor of two in the 5J45_2J60_J100 trigger (cf. Table 4) for roughly the same signal efficiency. Overall, the three trigger combinations given in Table 4 are optimal in terms of the figure of merit, and the 5 jet trigger combination leads to the best signal efficiency with the lowest background rate for fully-hadronic \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events. It is worth pointing out, that the reliable determination of trigger efficiencies from data is another challenging aspect of multi-jet triggers.

Large uncertainties are inherent in predictions for LHC energies, hence the QCD background trigger rates given here and the jet trigger definitions are preliminary and subject to tuning as soon as data taking starts. This is especially true for the effect of pile-up, which also impacts the signal trigger efficiencies. It is shown nevertheless that it should be possible to trigger on fully-hadronic \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) decays with reasonable efficiency by optimising the choice of thresholds and multiplicity. Further HLT studies are underway to fully exploit also advanced methods for background suppression, such as multi-variate analysis techniques.

### Missing \(E_{t}\) triggers in \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events

The L1 \(E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger performance in \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events is presented in this section. The HLT performance is not discussed due to ongoing development effort at the time of this writing.

The L1 energy triggers calculate missing transverse energy (\(E_{T}^{miss}\), trigger item name: XE) based on reduced granularity calorimeter data (the trigger towers) without taking muons into account, across an \(\eta\) range of \(|\eta|<5.0\)[4].

Figure 5 shows the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) spectra at L1 for \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) signal and background events normalized to an integrated luminosity of 1 pb\({}^{-1}\). Shown is the QCD background for which \(E_{T}^{miss}\) is mainly faked by jet response fluctuations and losses in non-instrumented regions of the calorimeters. In the W-boson+jets background, a neutrino from the W-boson decay is present and produces real \(E_{T}^{miss}\). Single top quark events are also shown, with a combined rate of about one third of \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\). As can be seen from the figure, high QCD rates will not permit inclusive \(E_{T}^{miss}\) triggers with low thresholds, hence L1 trigger efficiencies for \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events will be small at larger luminosities. While for example L1_XE30 has an efficiency of 81% for leptonic events (applying no selection cuts in the efficiency calculation), the efficiency decreases to 19% for L1_XE100. For comparison, the lowest un-prescaled \(E_{T}^{miss}\) threshold for the early running at a luminosity of \(10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) is expected to be L1_XE70 [4].

### Single-top trigger

The final state of leptonic single-top events in the s, t, and Wt channels are characterized by one high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) muon or electron, \(E_{T}^{miss}\), and by one to three jets. Since these leptons are among the high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) products of a W-boson decay, a relatively large lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold can be used to select the single-top events at the trigger level. Therefore, the most important triggers for selecting single-top events are the high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) muon and electron triggers. Multi-jet and \(E_{T}^{miss}\) triggers can be used in combination with lower threshold electron and muon triggers in order to enhance acceptance.

The turn-on curves for the mu20 and e22i trigger are shown in Fig. 6. The trigger efficiencies are shown with respect to the single-top selection (the cut-based one listed in detail in [7]), and are very similar to the ones found in \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events shown in the previous sections. Both triggers exhibit a sharp turn-on behaviour and a flat plateau up to 100 GeV.

The single-top event selection will include the trigger combination e22i OR e55 OR mu20. The efficiency for this combination, as well as the total trigger efficiencies for the individual items in the muon and electron channels, are shown in Table 5. The efficiencies are found to be high, above 80% in the muon channel, and up to 90% in the electron channel.

Figure 5: \(E_{T}^{miss}\) spectra as measured by the L1 trigger for leptonic and fully-hadronic \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) signals and the most significant backgrounds to \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\). The samples are normalized to an integrated luminosity of 1 pb\({}^{-1}\). Note that the \(W+jets\) samples used here include W-boson decays to electrons, muons, and taus, as described in Table 2 of [3].

Figure 6: Turn-on curves are shown for the mu20 (a) and the e22i (b) trigger. In both plots, the circles represent Wt-channel single-top, the squares represent s-channel single-top, and the triangles represent t-channel single-top events.

## 3 Trigger redundancy in top quark events

Due to the rich event topologies, top quark events satisfy many trigger items simultaneously. This redundancy may be exploited to enhance signal over background rates by forming combined trigger items and to monitor the trigger by providing information on trigger efficiencies from data.

Combining suitable trigger items may reduce significantly the background rate. For example, in a combined jet and \(E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger, the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) requirement will suppress the QCD background. For the same allocated bandwidth, the jet \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold of the combined trigger can be lowered compared to the inclusive single jet trigger. Overall this will increase the number of recorded leptonic \(\rm{t\bar{t}}\) events which have good acceptance for a moderate threshold on \(E_{T}^{miss}\).

On the other hand, if there is sufficient overlap between two triggers, the efficiency for one of the triggers can be measured by selecting offline a clean sample of \(\rm{t\bar{t}}\) events which satisfied the other trigger. For example, the lepton triggers used to select leptonic \(\rm{t\bar{t}}\) events could be monitored in events that have been triggered by the combined jet and \(E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger. Possible biases due to correlation should be checked and eventually corrected for.

### Trigger item overlap in \(\rm{t\bar{t}}\) events

The correlation among different trigger items is given in Fig. 7, with plot (a) showing overlaps for fully-hadronic \(\rm{t\bar{t}}\) events and plot (b) showing overlaps for leptonic \(\rm{t\bar{t}}\) events. The plots show the percentage of events triggered by the item on the \(x\)-axis that were also triggered by the item on the \(y\)-axis. The trigger items on the axes were representative of the ATLAS trigger menu at the time of this writing.

As expected, there is considerable overlap for the leptonic \(\rm{t\bar{t}}\) events, and the event topology of these events is clearly illustrated. The leptonic triggers have very low acceptance in the fully-hadronic \(\rm{t\bar{t}}\) events. Only the very low-\(p_{\rm T}\) muon triggers, which will be prescaled [4], have considerable efficiency due to muons from b-jets. Any combination of trigger items used to enhance the signal-to-background ratio in the fully-hadronic sample will have to rely on the jet triggers (cf. Section 2.3.1) only. For the leptonic channel, trigger combinations involving \(E_{T}^{miss}\) are potentially useful. Studies done at L1 have shown that \(E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger items indeed overlap considerably with the leptonic and jet triggers in leptonic \(\rm{t\bar{t}}\) events.

Table 5: Total trigger efficiencies for the three single-top channels. Efficiencies for the muon (W\(\rightarrow\mu\nu\)) and electron (W\(\rightarrow\)e\(\nu\)) channels are shown separately. The errors are calculated using the full available Monte Carlo statistics. Note that the reference event selection [7] selects one and only one isolated lepton for the electron and muon channel. Hence the trigger effciency in the Wt channel does not increase when taking the OR of electron and muon triggers as compared to the single electron or muon triggers.

## 4 Determination of trigger efficiencies from data and application to top quark events

Trigger efficiencies should be determined from data in order to reduce systematic uncertainties, as the shape as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the absolute value of trigger efficiencies are hard to describe precisely in simulations.

A methodology is tested to determine the electron trigger efficiency for top events in data. Events with Z-boson decays are used to parameterize the electron trigger efficiency as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) by means of the _tag and probe_ method [8]. These parametrized efficiencies yield correction factors which can then be applied to top events.

The Standard Model Z-boson decaying to two leptons is relatively free of backgrounds at the LHC, and therefore provides a clean source of events for the _tag and probe_ method. This method relies on the ability to obtain a clean sample of Z-boson events using selection cuts after obtaining the initial sample using a single electron trigger. From the di-electron final state one can _tag_ the electron that fired the trigger, and _probe_ the other in order to measure the trigger efficiency. Once this efficiency is extracted it can be applied to other processes which have been obtained using the same trigger, in this case top events.

Having selected top events using the commissioning selection [5], a correction for the trigger efficiency is applied to recover the number of events that would be measured by an ideal detector. For each event, a weight is applied according to the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the position in \(\eta\) of the electron in the event. The weight is taken as the inverse efficiency extracted from look-up tables, which have been obtained with the _tag-and-probe_ method.

Figure 8 shows the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(\eta\), and \(\phi\) distributions of the electron in the \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\) event. The dark histogram represents events that have passed the trigger selection, the black points show the events after the correction is applied. The lighter histogram is from a sample of events run with the trigger disabled. Also shown in the figure is the top quark mass as measured using the above selection, after a correction for the trigger efficiency. It can be seen from the figure that the efficiency correction works well, the effect of the trigger

Figure 7: Trigger item overlap at the HLT for fully-hadronic (a) and leptonic (b) \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\) events. The numbers in the plots indicate the percentage of events triggered by the item on the \(x\)-axis also triggered by the item on the \(y\)-axis. Note that, by definition, the values on the diagonal have full acceptance. The bottom row in each plot gives the total efficiency of the corresponding item on the \(x\)-axis.

can be recovered to reproduce the simulated distributions. The effect of additional jet activity in \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) events as compared to Z\(\rightarrow\)ee events is thus indicated not to have a big effect at the current level of precision.

The final value of the trigger efficiency, used as a correction to the cross section measurement of the leptonic \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) decay channel with one electron in the final state, is a value \(\epsilon_{trigger}\) of 92.6 \(\pm\) 0.4 % for an e12i trigger chain and 91.5 \(\pm\) 0.4 % for an e22i trigger chain for 100pb\({}^{-1}\). These values are obtained by taking the ratio of the number of events before and after the trigger correction, and the uncertainty is statistical only. Note that to obtain these numbers, a matching between the trigger and the reconstruction electron candidates has to be done (\(\Delta R<0.2\)), in contrast to the numbers in Table 1.

In conclusion, it is shown that the _tag-and-probe_ efficiency can be successfully applied to leptonic top decays. The method appears robust, however, the issue of background events passing the Z\(\rightarrow\)ee selection and the possible bias introduced thereby needs to be investigated.

## 5 Conclusions and outlook

The first studies of the expected ATLAS trigger performance for top events have been shown. All levels of the electron and muon triggers are found to be highly efficient for the _golden_ leptonic \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) decays. The jet triggers, especially important for hadronically decaying tops, are much more challenging to use due

to the high rate of QCD jets. High jet multiplicities of 5 or 6 jets with optimised \(p_{\rm T}\) thresholds may provide the best acceptance.

Top quark events at the LHC will have especially rich event topologies and will result in many trigger items being fulfilled simultaneously. The overlap of trigger items was investigated to identify combinations of trigger items with improved signal efficiency and trigger rate, as well as potential monitoring triggers. The use of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger should be further investigated.

The trigger efficiency should be determined from data with the least possible bias. This must be validated with Monte-Carlo simulations, comparing the efficiencies derived with the data driven methods to the true efficiencies. Such a study, albeit not yet complete, was shown for the electron trigger efficiency using simulated \(Z\to ee\) samples. By using the trigger efficiency correction to the reconstructed kinematical distributions, it was shown that the simulated top quark distributions are very well recovered.
