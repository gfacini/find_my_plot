Full simulation study of \(H\to 4\mu\) using the inner tracking

## 1 Experimental set-up

The analysis has been performed in the context of the ATLAS-B tracking detector set-up, composed, from the inside to the outside, by:

* 6 layers of inner silicon tracker (SITV);
* **TRD** with 1 m long straws parallel to the beam axis in the barrel;
* 6 layers of outer silicon tracker;
* microstrip gas chamber detector (MSGC) in the forward-backward regions;
* the standard version of integrated coil + preshower + calorimeters + \(\mu\)-chambers;

as illustrated in Fig. 1. The granularities of the detectors are given in Tab. 1. Only the information from SITV, SIT, MSGC and \(\mu\)-chambers has been used in this analysis. The geometrical acceptance is the one of the 8 m long inner detector cavity.

Production

For this analysis, the data stream was used, which was produced for the LOI. The study of the signal has been made on the production tape I28344 in which about 700 \(H\to 4\mu\) events (\(m_{H}\) = 130 GeV) are recorded. The minimum bias (40 in average) superimposed on the events for the study of the signal in presence of pile-up were taken from the production tape I28493. Both signal and background were generated using PYTHIA 5.6 and then passed through a full GEANT simulation of the ATLAS detector.

For single \(\mu\) response studies (\(E\) = 50 GeV, \(|\eta|\) < 3.0) the tape I28346 has been used.

## 3 Single \(\mu\) response

Our first goal was to reach a high reconstruction efficiency on single \(\mu\) events passing through the apparatus. The perfect hit coordinates, recorded at production time, have been digitized according to the granularity of each tracking detector. The reconstructed space points were passed to a helix-fit routine which is able to reconstruct the vertex and the momentum of muons.

The major problem has been the selection of the "good" hits (produced by the \(\mu\)) rejecting the secondary ones (noise,background, bremsstrahlung,...). A first selection was made defining a road based on a limitated information from \(\mu\)-chambers. The central point of the road has been defined as the projection on the EM calorimeter of the impact point on the first \(\mu\)-chamber according to the direction given by the momentum of the \(\mu\) at that position (i.e. no pattern recognition has been used for the \(\mu\)'s chambers). Such a road, which does not take into account effects such as multiple scattering, catastrophic energy losses,... was not optimized as it is evident in Fig. 2 and in Fig. 3.

To avoid this inefficiency, for the \(\mu\)'s presenting a difference between the real and the projected road greater than 5 cm, the central point of the road has been redefined as the real impact position on the EM calorimeter smeared according to a gaussian (\(\sigma\) = 5 cm).

The edges of the road have been defined as a 10 cm\(\times\)10 cm square on the calorimeter and a window of 12 cm\(\times\)30 \(\mu\)m on the centre of the detector. A linear projection on the longitudinal plane (along \(z\)) and a semi-helix projection on the transverse plane as illustrated in Fig. 4 have been used. The curve \(b\) represents the ideal trajectory of a \(\mu\) having \(p_{T}\) = 0.8\(p_{T}^{ee}\) (\(p_{T}^{ee}\) is the transverse momentum of the \(\mu\) in the first chamber) and \(a\) the trajectory for a \(\mu\) with \(p_{T}\) = \(\infty\).

The hits lying outside the defined road were thrown away while, on the surviving hits, a selection routine has been applied based on a linear fit of the hits position in the \(\rho-\phi\) plane. The hits having a deviation from the fit greater than a chosen parameter (\(\sim 60\mu\)m) related to the granularity of the detectors were rejected.

Finally a looped helix-fit, rejecting all the hits lying outside \(3\sigma\) of the fitted trajectory at each loop, is performed on the remaining hits. The results of the helix-fit are considered as the measured values. This fit algorithm allowed us to reach an efficiency of about 98% on the reconstruction of single \(\mu\)'s, where for efficient reconstruction we mean \(|(p_{T}^{ee}-p_{T}^{gen})/p_{T}^{gen}|<0.2\) for \(|\eta|\) < 3.0 (by \(\eta\) here and in the following we mean Figure 3: Distance in cm between the real and the projected road.

the generated \(\mu\)'s \(\eta\)). In Fig. 5 the energy resolution of \(\mu\)'s with \(E=50\) GeV and \(|\eta|<3.0\) is shown.

## 4 "Single Higgs" response

First the analysis on the single Higgs events i.e. without any minimum bias activity superimposed has then been performed.

Also in this case the optimization was performed first on the fit parameters (essentially \(d\chi^{2}\) of the helix-fit and acceptance region of the linear fit) leaving the road window untouched.

Good results were obtained, which correspond to an efficiency, for well reconstructed Higgs events, of about 90%. Well reconstructed events mean events in which all four \(\mu\)'s (in a range of \(|\eta|<3.0\)) are reconstructed with a discrepancy on the real \(p_{T}\) less than 20%. In Fig. 6 is shown \(dp_{T}^{\mu}/(p_{T}^{\mu})^{2}\) for the whole sample and in Fig. 7 the reconstructed \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) spectrum.

It has to be pointed out that, after the application of the selection algorithm, almost all the Higgs events did not fail the helix-fit routine, i.e. almost in each event the \(\mu\) reconstruction algorithm has converged for all the \(\mu\)'s from the decay, so the total (not only "good") reconstruction efficiency can be considered \(\sim 100\%\).

A \(p_{T}\) cut of 5 GeV has been applied at filter level.

## 5 Reconstructed Higgs mass

The algorithm for the reconstruction of Higgs masses is based on the selection of two couples of \(\mu\)'s in each event, one of which approaches the \(Z\) mass and the other one comes from an off mass-shell \(Z^{\star}\). For each couple of \(\mu\)'s with opposite charge the invariant mass was reconstructed and the couple with \(M_{inv}\) closest to the \(Z\) mass has been considered as coming from the on mass-shell \(Z\). With the remaining reconstructed \(\mu\)'s, which can be more than two, all the possible off mass-shell \(Z^{\star}\) were reconstructed and, consequently, all the possible Higgses. All the Higgs masses were put in a histogram and fitted with a gaussian. The mean value has been taken as a reference Higgs mass and, for each event, only the Higgs with the invariant mass closest to the reference mass has been accepted.

In Fig. 8 are shown the mass distributions of the on mass and off mass-shell \(Z\). The reconstructed Higgs masses (\(\sim\) 200 events), after the complete application of the algorithm is shown in Fig. 9.

## 6 Higgs with minimum bias events superimposed

Finally a set of 40 minimum bias events (poisson average) taken from tape I28493 has been superimposed on the Higgs events to simulate the pile-up effects.

In this case, keeping the same search algorithm used for "single Higgs" events, the efficiency dropped to a value of \(\sim\) 50%, showing the necessity to develop a new selection algorithm.

This has been based on the calculation of the helix trajectory in the \(\rho-\phi\) plane for each couple of hits. The \(\phi_{0}\) value (initial angle of the calculated trajectory) has been histogrammed. The channel with maximum number of occurrences has been chosen as

the best estimate for \((\phi_{0})\). Finally all the hits for which it was not possible to find a "partner" hit giving a \(\phi_{0}\) lying in \((\phi_{0})\pm 5\) channel have been rejected.

This rejection routine, applied just before the linear fit, allowed us to increase the efficiency on the "good" Higgs events up to \(\sim 80\%\) (\(\sim 95\%\) for single \(\mu\)'s) with a \(m_{H}\) resolution of \(\sim 2.6\) GeV (Fig.12).

In Fig. 10 is illustrated the "good" \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) reconstruction efficiency in function of \(|\eta|\). The two drop in efficiency at \(|\eta|\sim 1.0\) and \(|\eta|\sim 1.9\) correspond respectively to the crack between the central and forward tracker and the one in the MSGC. In Fig. 11 the number of hits in road before (a) and after (b) the application of the selection algorithm is shown as a profile histogram in function of \(|\eta|\). It is evident that the selection algorithm contributes to make the distribution flatter as it is expected.

The total reconstruction efficiency holds \(\sim 100\%\). In Fig. 13 is shown in detail the complete algorithm used in this analysis to select the Higgs signal.

## 7 Conclusions

The aim of this study has been the investigation of the possibility to select a \(H\to 4\mu\) signal using only the information from the inner tracking system (ATLAS-B set-up) and a reduced information from the outer \(\mu-\)chambers.

In fully operating conditions with a reasonable pile-up (40 minimum bias), an efficiency of \(\sim 80\%\) for Higgs events (\(\sim 95\%\) for single \(\mu\)) has been reached using a selection algorithm essentially based on the selection of linear tracks in the \(\rho-\phi\) plane and a helix-fit on the left hits.

The resolution on Higgs mass, without additional cuts, is of \(\sim 2.6\) GeV for the case Figure 11: Number of hits in road before (a) and after (b) the application of the selection algorithm vs \(|\eta|\).

with 40 minimum bias and \(\sim\) 1.9 GeV for Higgs alone events (\(\sim\) 95% reconstruction efficiency of \(\mu\) with minimum bias and \(\sim\) 98% for \(\mu\) alone).

This study has to be considered just as a first step and for this reason resolution and efficiency were not optimized any further, as could be easily done, in particular using more precise information on the road from other detectors as calorimeters, preshower and TRD and using the pattern recognition capability of the TRD device.

We also plane to perform \(\mu\) reconstruction in outer \(\mu\)-chambers and to improve the total reconstruction by matching the two.
