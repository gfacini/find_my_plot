## Chapter 1 Introduction

### 1.1 LHC and ATLAS

The **L**_arge_ **H**_adron_ **C**_ollider_ (**LHC**), is a proton-proton collider to be built in the existing LEP tunnel at CERN. The center of mass energy is \(\sqrt{s}=14\)\(TeV\), with a predicted maximum luminosity of \({\cal L}=10^{34}\)\(cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) and a bunch spacing of 25 ns.

**ATLAS** (**A** _Toroidal_ **L**_HC_ **A**_pparatus_**S**), is a general purpose detector for one of the LHC p-p experiments. It has an approximately cylindrical shape, (fig. 1.1), and is composed by the following sub-detectors: an inner detector for particle tracking, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters for energy measurements and a muon spectrometer. In addition to these sub-detectors, there is a superconducting solenoid placed between the inner detector and the electromagnetic calorimeter, and an air-core toroid magnet system in the muon spectrometer, to allow particle momentum measurement. The ATLAS Technical Proposal [1], gives a detailed description of the detector.

### 1.2 Physics purposes

The LHC offers a large range of physics opportunities, among which are the following:Figure 1.1: 3D view of the ATLAS detector.

* The origin of mass at the electroweak scale in the Standard Model (SM). The detector must be sensitive to the largest possible Higgs mass range. The prominent channels are: 1. \(H\to\,b\overline{b}\) for 80 \(<m_{H}<100GeV\) 2. \(H\to\,\gamma\gamma\) for 90 \(<m_{H}<150GeV\) 3. \(H\to\,Z\,Z^{*}\to 4\,l^{\pm}\) for 130 \(<m_{H}<\,2m_{\,Z}\) 4. \(H\to\,Z\,Z\to 4\,l^{\pm},\,2l^{\pm}2\nu\) for \(m_{H}>2m_{\,Z}\) 5. \(H\to WW\), \(Z\,Z\to\,l^{\pm}\nu 2j\), \(2l^{\pm}2j\) for \(m_{H}\simeq 1TeV\)
* In the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model, two Higgs doublets are required resulting in 5 physical states \(H^{+}\), \(H^{-}\), \(h\) (neutral lighter scalar), \(H\) (neutral heavier scalar) and \(A\) (neutral pseudoscalar). In this case, the relevant channels are \(A/H\to\tau\tau\), \((h,H)\to\gamma\gamma\), \(H\to ZZ\to 4l\) and \(t\to bH^{+}\).
* Strongly interacting Higgs, \(m_{H}\geq 1TeV\). Search for \(W\) pairs, since \(WW\) fusion will be dominated by the longitudinal components, and the rate of production of \(W_{L}\) pairs will provide information on the nature of the dynamical process responsible for the symmetry breaking.
* Top-quark physics such as measurement of top mass in different channels and searches for rare top-quark decays: \(t\to bH^{+}\) and \(t\to Zc\).
* B physics, specifically; search and measurement of CP violation through the decays of \(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi\,K_{S}^{0}\), \(B_{d}^{0}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\,\phi\) to measure the angles \(\beta\), \(\alpha\) and \(\gamma\) of the Cabibbo- Kobayashi-Maskawa unitary triangle respectively. Measurement of \(B_{s}^{0}\) mixing. Searches for rare decays such as \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(B_{d}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\). Study of B-baryon decay dynamics and spectroscopy of rare B hadrons.
* Beyond the SM. Searches for Supersymmetric particles, new vector bosons, leptoquarqs, quark and lepton compositeness.
* ATLAS can be complementary to a dedicated heavy ion experiment with the main purpose for the search of quark-gluon plasma.

This is only a brief overview of the wide range of physics studies proposed for the ATLAS detector. These issues are detailed in the ATLAS Technical Proposal [1] in chapter 11 and references therein.

### 1.3 The TILECAL hadronic calorimeter

TILECAL, is the sampling hadronic calorimeter to be used in the barrel and extended barrel region of the ATLAS detector. It uses iron as passive material, and plastic scintillating tiles as active material. The tiles are read out by \(\mathbf{W}\)aveLength-Shifter fibers (\(\mathbf{W}\mathbf{L}\mathbf{S}\)), which lead the signal to photomultiplier tubes (PMT's), [3].

The calorimeter has \(2.25\,m\) internal radius and \(4.25\,m\) external radius, amounting thereby to \(7.5\) nuclear interaction lengths (\(\lambda_{I}\)) at pseudo-rapidity \(\eta=0\)1. The TILECAL is constituted by one barrel calorimeter in \(|\eta|\leq 1.0\) region, and two extended barrel calorimeters in the \(1.0\leq|\eta|\leq 1.6\) regions, (fig. 1.2).

Footnote 1: Pseudo-rapidity is defined by: \(\eta=-\log\left(\tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right)\).

Figure 1.2: Two dimensional view of the ATLAS calorimeter system.

The combination in TILECAL of the readout by WLS fibers and the innovative way of the tile orientation, allows a very good hermiticity and easy construction of the stack of iron and tiles. The scintillating tiles are placed in planes perpendicular to the colliding beams and staggered in depth, up to a total of 11 with different radial dimensions. Barrel and extended barrel calorimeters are divided in 64 independent azimuthal modules. The scintillator tiles lie in the \(r-\phi\) plane (fig. 1.3) and span the width of the module in the \(\phi\) direction. WLS fibers running radially collect light from the tiles at both of their open edges. Readout cells are then defined by grouping together a set of fibers onto a PMT, to obtain radial and longitudinal segmentation. Radially, the calorimeter is segmented into three layers, approximately 1.5 (3 tiles), 4.2 (6 tiles) and 1.9 (2 tiles) interaction lengths thick each at \(\eta=\)0. The segmentation will be \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\) in the first two radial layers and \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.1\) in the last radial layer.

The major goals of the hadronic calorimeter are to identify jets and measure their energy and direction, to measure the total missing transverse energy (\(E_{T}^{miss}\)) and to enhance the particle identification capability of the electromagnetic calorimeter, measuring quantities such as leakage and isolation.

Figure 1.3: TILECAL test beam module prototype.

Performance of the TILECAL prototypes

Five 1 m long prototype modules (fig. 1.3), have been constructed and exposed to test beams (high energy \(\pi\), \(e\) and \(\mu\) at CERN SPS), in the framework of RD34 collaboration. The main results are the following:

* The energy resolution for pions has been studied in the energy range from 20 to 300 GeV, and at angles \(\theta\) from 0\({}^{\circ}\) to 45\({}^{\circ}\). The observed energy resolution (after a simple correction, see [3] for details), at \(\theta=20^{\circ}\) is \(\sigma/E=45\%/\sqrt{E}+1.3\%\).
* The \(e/\pi\) ratio has been determined to lie between 1.1 and 1.2 over the energy range studied. Since \(e/\pi\neq 1\) causes deviations from linearity in the hadronic response, and broadening of the energy resolution, the same correction mentioned above restores the pion signal linearity to within 1% (RMS) deviation.
* Uniformity has been studied with pions of 40 and 80 GeV at \(\theta=10^{\circ}\). A 60 cm scan across the front face of the calorimeter, gives a response uniform to within 0.9% (RMS).

It was also proven in test beams with muons (test-beam of 1995), that the TILECAL calorimeter can detect isolated muons with a signal to background ratio \(S/B=10\), allowing to correct the muon energy in the ATLAS detector, [4].

### 1.5 TILECAL dose levels

The high luminosity (\(\mathcal{L}=10^{4}\,cm^{-2}s^{-1}\)) at which the detectors must operate, imposes stringent requirements in the detector components concerning radiation damage.

High dose levels of ionizing radiation are expected, especially in the inner detectors and calorimeters. Fig. 1.4 shows the isodose map for the inner detectors and calorimeters in \(Gy/year\) (1 Gy = 100 rad, 1 LHC year corresponds to 10\({}^{7}\) s). Those values were obtained by Monte-Carlo simulation using the FLUKApackage in combination with DTUET code, which generates p-p minimum bias interactions [10].

These high dose levels impose the use of detector components which are radiation hard, having a minimal degradation during 10 years of LHC operation. So, one important task is the study and selection of radiation hard components for the detectors. In the TILECAL calorimeter, the sensitive components are essentially the scintillator tiles and WLS fibers.

From simulation studies, it is estimated that the maximum total dose in the barrel hadronic calorimeter is of the order of 23 krad (from which 13 krad are due to charged particles, and 10 krad are due to the neutron flux), and 36 krad in the extended barrel, (from which 26 krad are due to charged particles and 10 krad are due to the neutron flux). The relation between the integrated neutron fluence \(F_{n}\) (n/cm\({}^{2}\)) and induced dose deposited in the plastic (Gy) considering only elastic processes (\(\sigma_{elast}\) in cm\({}^{2}\)) is given by [5]:

\[Dose_{n}=F_{n}\frac{N_{0}\sigma_{elast}}{A}\frac{<E>}{2} \tag{1.1}\]

where \(N_{0}\) is the number of protons per mass unit (\(N_{0}=5.2\times 10^{25}\) Kg\({}^{-1}\) for plastic), \(A\) is the atomic number of the nucleus on which the neutron is elastically scattered (1 for the hydrogen in the plastic scintillator), and \(\frac{<E>}{2}\) (J) is the mean energy of the proton recoil after elastic scattering.

The guideline for this work will be 10 years integrated dose in the extended barrel, that is a dose of the order of 36 krad.

### 1.6 Radiation hardness of the calorimeter optical components

It is well known that plastic scintillators and WLS fibers are degraded by the passage of ionizing radiation, decreasing their light yield and attenuation length and therefore decreasing their overall light output. As a consequence, detectors made of scintillators that are design to operate in high dose radiation environments of present and future colliders, will lose performance along the time.

The Portuguese calorimetry group has been involved since 1984, among other Figure 1.4: Yearly integrated dose \((Gy/year)\) in the inner detector and calorimeters.

activities, in the study of radiation damage of plastic scintillating fibers, and in the last two years, of plastic scintillating plates (tiles) and WLS fibers. The first experiment was performed with the electromagnetic calorimeter of the NA38 fixed target experiment. This calorimeter was made of scintillating fibers and lead being placed behind the target, and therefor exposed to high doses of ionizing radiation. The second experiment was the development and optimization of the SPACAL calorimeter, one of the possible choices for the ATLAS detector until the end of 1992. This calorimeter was made of scintillating fibers and lead, and the issue of high dose levels of radiation in the LHC experiments triggered the R&D in radiation damage on scintillating fibers, to be used in this detector [7] and [8].

Since the beginning of 1993, the group has been involved in the development and optimization of the TILECAL calorimeter. A R&D is being carried out to test the radiation hardness of scintillating tiles and WLS fibers envisaged to be used in the calorimeter. Several tile/WLS fibers assemblies in the TILECAL configuration, were irradiated in a \({}^{60}\)_Co_\(\gamma\) source with a total dose of 300 krad (approximately 10 times the total dose expected in the barrel, for 10 years of LHC operation). The main conclusions of this study were: a global decrease of \(\sim 20\%\) in the light output of the assembly is observed (in the worst case) due to radiation damage, from which only less than 5% is attributed to the scintillating tiles, [6] and [9].

Additionally, it was observed that dose rate effects exist in plastic scintillators, in other words, the damage of certain scintillators submitted to a certain total dose in a short time irradiation (high dose rate), is different from a submission to the same dose in a long time irradiation (low dose rate). This matter is a subject of large controversy.

The purpose of this thesis, is to study the dose rate effects in WLS fibers envisaged to be used in the TILECAL calorimeter. For this study, several types of commercially available fibers from three enterprises (Bicron, Kuraray and Pol. Hi. Tech) were irradiated with a total dose of \(\sim 140\) krad, and at dose rates of 4 krad/h, 1.1 krad/h and 0.53 krad/h. Besides the traditional WLS fibers, double cladding fibers and fibers doped with an Ultra Violet Absorber (**UVA**), have been also studied.

It was observed, that the WLS fibers produce a non negligible amount of light when excited by ionizing particles. The selection of fibers for STIC, the DELPHI luminosity monitor, was done using this feature, exciting the fibers with electrons from a \({}^{90}Sr\)\(\beta\) source, to produce light in the fibers. This light could come from the Cerenkov light produced inside the fiber and shifted to their emission spectrum, or scintillation light coming from the polystyrene base. When the first prototype calorimeter modules were submitted to the test beam, it was observed that the signal was too enhanced when the particles where hitting the region filled with the fibers (crack in between modules). Consequently, a deterioration of the calorimeter uniformity was seen. To avoid this, an UV absorber is added to the WLS fibers to reduce this scintillation and/or Cerenkov light.

I give now a brief overview of this thesis. In chapter 2, the energy loss of particles in matter and the scintillating processes in organic materials are described. The particular case of WLS fibers is considered, and the state of the art of radiation damage and low dose rate effects in scintillating and WLS materials is presented. A parameterization of the degradation of the light output of the fibers submitted to ionizing radiation, is given.

Chapter 3, gives a description of the irradiation setup and dosimetry of the installation used to irradiate the WLS fibers. A simulation was performed using the EGS4 (Electron Gamma Shower) Monte-Carlo code, in order to predict the dose in some positions of the installation where the fibers are irradiated.

Chapter 4, reports the experimental studies on low dose rate effects on WLS fibers. Several types of WLS fibers were irradiated at different doserates (0.53 krad/h, 1.1 krad/h and 4 krad/h), at a total dose of 140 krad. The optical properties were measured before and after irradiation. The analysis and the results are presented. The results on radiation damage of scintillating fibers used in the prototype modules of the SPACAL calorimeter, are given (these results refer to experiments done in 1992 and early 1993). The measurement setup of the optical properties of the fibers used since 1993, named _Fibrometer_ is described. A preliminary study of the damage of WLS fibers by mechanical stress is presented. A summary of the results are given.

Finally in chapter 5, some conclusions are drawn, as well as the work in progress on this field.

## Chapter 2 Scintillation processes and radiation damage in organic materials

### 2.1 Energy loss of particles in matter

#### 2.1.1 Electromagnetic interactions

##### Energy loss of heavy charged particles in matter

In general, two main processes characterize the passage of heavy (\(m\gg m_{e}\)) charged particles (\(\mu\), \(\pi\), \(p\), etc.) through matter [16]:

1. Inelastic collisions - are the electromagnetic process responsible for the energy loss of heavy charged particles in matter. In these collisions, energy is transferred from the particle to the atomic electrons causing an ionization or excitation of the atom. An important issue is that the amount of energy transferred in each collision, is a very small fraction of the total kinetic energy of the particle. If the material is dense, the number of collisions is large in small lengths on the particle path, and a cumulative effect makes high energy losses even in thin layers of such materials.

2. Elastic scattering from nuclei - is a deflection of the incident particle from its initial direction (also referred as multiple Coulomb scattering). Also occurs frequently, although not as often as electron collisions. In general very little energy is transferred in these collisions since the masses of the nuclei of most materials are usually large compared to the incident particle.

Atomic collisions can be divided in two groups:

1. Soft collisions, in which only an excitation of an atomic electron results.
2. Hard collisions, in which the transferred energy is sufficient to cause ionization of the atom. High energy electrons, known as \(\delta-rays\) can be produced in hard collisions and cause themselves substantial secondary ionization.

The energy loss per unit length is given by the Bethe-Bloch formula:

\[-\frac{dE}{dx}=\,2\pi\,N_{a}r_{e}^{2}m_{e}c^{2}\rho\frac{Z\,z^{2}}{A\beta^{2}} \left[\ln\,\left(\frac{2m_{e}\gamma^{2}v^{2}W_{max}}{I^{2}}\right)\,-\,2\beta^{ 2}\,-\,\delta\,-\,2\frac{C}{Z}\right] \tag{2.1}\]

Where:

\(r_{e}\) - classical electron radius.

\(m_{e}\) - electron mass.

\(N_{a}\) - Avogadro's number.

\(Z\) - atomic number of absorbing material.

\(A\) - atomic weight of absorbing material.

\(\rho\) - density of absorbing material.

\(z\) - charge of incident particle in units of electron charge.

\(\beta=v/c\) - velocity of incident particle.

\(\gamma=1/\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}\)

\(\delta\) - density correction.

\(C\) - shell correction.

\(I\) - mean excitation potential, semi-empirical parameter which is essentially the average orbital frequency.

\(W_{max}=\frac{2m_{e}(e\beta\gamma)^{2}}{1+2m_{e}/M\,\sqrt{1+(\beta\gamma)^{2}+ m_{e}^{2}/M^{2}}}\) - maximum energy transfer in a single collision.

In fig. 2.1 is plotted the specific energy loss \((\frac{dE}{dx})\) as a function of kinetic energy \((E)\) for different materials. At non-relativistic energies, \(\frac{dE}{dx}\) is dominated by the overall \(1/\beta^{2}\) factor until a minimum is reached at \(v\simeq 0.96c\), where the particles are minimum ionizing. Beyond this point \(\frac{dE}{dx}\) increases with a logarithmic dependence, but canceled by the density correction \(\delta\) which is an empirical function of \(\log(\beta\gamma)\).

### Energy loss of electrons and positrons

Electrons and positrons lose their energy by collision with atomic electrons of the material, and through emission of bremsstrahlung radiation. Bremsstrahlung is the emission of electromagnetic radiation, arising from scattering in the electric field of a nucleus of the incident electron or positron. This energy loss mechanism is due to the small mass of the electron. Since the cross section for this mechanism is \(\sigma\propto 1/m^{2}\), bremsstrahlung emission by heavier particles is very rare at present energies available (few hundredth of GeV).

The total energy loss of electrons and positrons is therefore, composed of two parts:

\[\left(\frac{dE}{dx}\right)_{total}=\left(\frac{dE}{dx}\right)_{rad}+\left( \frac{dE}{dx}\right)_{coll} \tag{2.2}\]

Fig. 2.2 shows the radiation loss vs. collision loss for electrons in copper. As can be seen, there is a critical energy \((E_{crit})\) for which the collision loss and the radiation loss are equal, that is:

\[\left(\frac{dE}{dx}\right)_{rad}=\left(\frac{dE}{dx}\right)_{coll} \tag{2.3}\]

For iron \(E_{crit}=27.4\,MeV\) and for Polystyrene \(E_{crit}=109MeV\), which are the passive and active material of the TILECAL calorimeter, respectively.

### Interaction of photons

There are three major electromagnetic processes by which photons interact with matter:

1. The photoelectric effect - is an interaction between the photon and the atom as a whole. Incident photons, whose energy exceeds the binding energy of an electron in the atom, may be absorbed and an atomic electron ejected.
2. The Compton effect - involves the scattering of an incident photon with an atomic electron, much like an elastic scattering between two particles.
3. Pair production - is the most important interaction of photons in matter at high energies. The intense electric field near the nucleus, can cause the photon to decay into an electron and a positron.

Fig 2.3 shows the contributions to the photon interaction cross section in lead. For photon energies below 500 keV, the interactions are almost totally due

Figure 2.2: Radiation loss vs. collision loss for electrons in copper. Taken from reference [16].

Taken from reference [17].

to the photoelectric effect (\(\tau\)). While for photon energies above 50 MeV they are primarily due to pair production off the nucleus (\(K_{n}\)). The Compton effect plays an important role in the intermediate energy range (\(\sigma_{IN\,COH}\)).

#### Interactions of hadrons with matter

The particles that are subject to strong interactions (hadrons), lose part of their energy electromagnetically in the ways described previously for heavy charged particles, and part by the strong interaction with the atomic nuclei of the material.

The interaction of high energy hadrons can be divided in two different steps:

1. Fast and high energetic cascade phase where multiplication occurs. When a high energy hadron enters a block of matter, it will ionize the atoms of the material and will interact at same point with one nucleus. The fraction of incident energy deposited in the nucleus will cause particle production, which can cause internuclear cascade interacting with other nucleon inside the nucleus. If the energy is sufficient, the nucleus can produce many particles (like protons, neutrons and heavier fragments), that can escape the nucleus carrying much of its energy (_spallation_), or break apart (_fast fission_), and the nucleus being left in an excited state.
2. Slow and low energetic phase, where de-excitation of the nucleus occurs in successive evaporation steps with thermal neutrons, protons, \(\alpha\)'s and \(\gamma\)'s being emitted during nuclear transitions. For heavy nuclei there is a competition between evaporation and fission. During the evaporation step, relatively few charged particles like protons and \(\alpha\)'s are released because of the Coulomb barrier of the excited nucleus.

Hadrons deposit their energy in the absorbing material in four different components:

1. Electromagnetic component, mainly \(\gamma\)'s from \(\pi^{0}\) and \(\eta^{0}\) decay.
2. Nuclear break-up, in form of invisible energy which is used to release nucleons from the nuclear field that binds them together.

3. Ionization energy loss of charged hadrons produced in the interactions with matter.
4. Neutrons with energies of a few MeV and below.

### 2.2 Scintillation process in organic solid materials

#### Luminescence

Luminescence is the emission of light (visible or ultraviolet) with a characteristic spectrum, following the absorption of radiation. It is an inherent molecular property associated with conjugated and aromatic organic molecules, and arising from the electronic structure of these molecules [15].

The structure of organic molecules is largely determined by the electronic structure of the carbon atom. This atom has three valences (4, 3 and 2), corresponding to single bonds (saturated molecules), double and triple bonds (aromatic and conjugated molecules). Saturated molecules have just \(\sigma\) electronic orbital, while molecules with double and triple bond carbons have also \(\pi\) electronic orbitals.

Since luminescence arises from the excitation or ionization of \(\pi\) molecular electrons, only double and triple bond molecules are luminescent. Saturated molecules do not have this property.

There are three types of luminescence:

1. _Fluorescence_ - Correspond to a radiative transition from the first excited singlet state \(S_{1}\) to the ground singlet state \(S_{0}\) (process \(\alpha_{1}\) in fig. 2.4). The radiative lifetime of \(S_{1}\) is \(\sim 10^{-8}-10^{-9}\) seconds, long compared with molecular vibrations (\(\sim 10^{-12}\) sec). This means that the molecule will reach thermal equilibrium before emission. The intensity of the fluorescence emission decays exponentially with time: \(I(t)=I_{0}\exp(-t/\tau)\), where \(I_{0}\) is the intensity at \(t=0\) and \(\tau\) is the fluorescence decay time. A molecule excited into any of the \(\pi\)-singlet states (\(S_{2}\), \(S_{3}\), etc.), is rapidly brought by internal conversion between electronic states, and by thermal degradation of excess vibrational energy, into the \(S_{1}\) level.
2. _Phosphorescence -_ Is an emission at longer wavelengths than fluorescence, which decays exponentially with a much longer decay time (\(\sim 10^{-4}\) sec or longer), (process \(\beta\) in fig. 2.4).
3. _Delayed fluorescence -_ Is an emission with an identical spectrum to the fluorescence, but which decays non-exponentially with a long decay period (process \(\alpha_{2}\) followed by \(\alpha_{1}\) in fig. 2.4)

The origin of these two latter types of luminescence, can be explained by the existence of a metastable state \(M\) below \(S_{1}\) (fig 2.4). The metastable state \(M\) is initially populated, a slow radiative transition may occur from this state to the ground state \(S_{0}\) (this is the phosphorescence process). If, with time, the molecule acquires sufficient thermal activation energy, it will return to \(S_{1}\) and decay (this is the delayed fluorescence process).

#### Scintillation properties of organic systems

The principal scintillation properties of organic systems are the following:

1. Absolute scintillation efficiency \(S\): a small fraction of the order of a few percent of the incident particle energy, is converted to \(N\) fluorescent photons

Figure 2.4: Origin of phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence.

of mean energy \(E_{p}\). The remainder of the incident energy is dissipated non-radiatively.
2. Scintillation emission spectrum in a ternary system (which is our case of interest for the scintillating tiles), is mainly that of the secondary fluor. The excitation energy of the base material (polystyrene in our case), is transferred via the primary fluor to the secondary fluor.
3. Scintillation response \(L\) to different ionizing radiation: the heavier and/or the slower the particle, the higher is the ionization and excitation density, and the scintillation efficiency is reduced. This is the _ionization quenching_ effect.
4. Scintillation decay time \(\tau\) of the fast and slow components. The typical decay times for the fast component are of the order of 2 to 30 nsec. The slow component has a similar emission spectrum of that of the fast component but non-exponential decay times of a few \(\mu\)sec, and intensities of the order of 10% of that of the fast component. Due to ionization quenching, the intensity of the fast component is different for different particles traversing the scintillator, whence the pulse shape is different. This effect can be used to differentiate between different particles.

#### Scintillation response

Ideally, the scintillator response \(L\) is proportional to the energy \(E\) deposited by the traversing particle, through the equation:

\[L=SE \tag{2.4}\]

Or expressed in differential form:

\[\frac{dL}{dr}=S\frac{dE}{dr} \tag{2.5}\]

Where \(\frac{dE}{dr}\) is the specific energy loss (given, for example, by the Bethe-Block formula, eq. 2.1), and \(\frac{dL}{dr}\) is the specific fluorescence. Eq. 2.5, holds true for fast electrons (\(>1MeV\)), but for heavier and/or slower particles which produce ionization quenching effects, eq. 2.5 is modified to the following semi-empirical relation proposed by Birks [15]:

\[\frac{dL}{dr}=\frac{S\frac{dE}{dr}}{1+kB\frac{dE}{dr}} \tag{2.6}\]

The parameter \(kB\) is known as Birks constant. It can be seen that if \(dE/dr\gg 1/kB\), than \(dL/dr\) will approach a constant:

\[\frac{dL}{dr}=\frac{S}{kB} \tag{2.7}\]

On the other hand, if \(dE/dr\ll 1/kB\), eq. 2.6 will approach eq. 2.5, which is the linear regime.

In fig. 2.5 the variation of specific fluorescence with specific energy loss is shown. The dashed line is the linear regime and the full line is the function of eq. 2.6. The experimental points, are a compilation of measurements from several authors with electrons, protons and \(\alpha\)-particles in anthracene crystals. These crystals have been widely used as a reference scintillator, since the light output of a high variety of all types of scintillators (solid, liquid and gaseous), have been normalized to the light output of anthracene crystals (due to its high scintillation efficiency).

### 2.3 Light yield and attenuation length of plastic optical fibers

A fiber is constituted by a core with a refractive index \(N_{1}\), and a cladding with a refractive index \(N_{2}<N_{1}\). The cladding involves and protects the core by one hand, and traps some of the light refracted from the core (which otherwise would be lost to the air). There are fibers in which the cladding has a double layer, called double-cladding (_DC_) fibers. The second cladding layer has a refractive index \(N_{3}<N_{2}\). A schematic drawing of a scintillating optical fiber is shown in fig. 2.6.

Figure 2.5: Variation of specific fluorescence with specific energy loss. Experimental data from anthracene crystals compiled from several authors. \(\square\) - external electrons, +, \(\blacktriangle\), \(\blacktriangledown\) - photoelectrons, \(\circ\), \(\times\), \(\bigtriangledown\) - protons, \(\bullet\), \(\triangle\) - \(\alpha\)-particles. Taken from [15].

For a scintillating fiber, the core is made of a base material (e.g. polystyrene), a first dopant (e.g. PTP) with a concentration of a few percent and a second dopant (e.g. POPOP) with a much lower concentration \(\sim\) 0.01% - 0.1%. The second dopant act as a wavelength shifter (see appendix A for more details). For a WLS fiber, the core is also usually made of polystyrene (PS) plus a die (e.g. K27) which absorbs and shifts the wavelength of the incident light, emitting it in a longer wavelength. The cladding is usually made from acrylic PMMA or fluorinated-PMMA.

The light output of a scintillating or WLS fiber, can be described by a single exponential function if the distance \(x\) to the PMT is big enough (\(\geq\)1 m):

\[I(x)=I_{0}\exp\left(-\frac{x}{L_{att}}\right) \tag{2.8}\]

where \(I_{0}\) and \(L_{att}\) are the effective light yield and attenuation length.

Fig. 2.7 shows the absorption and emission spectrum of a BCF91A WLS fiber. For this fiber, the emission spectrum peaks at 500 nm. In general, the attenuation length is a function of the wavelength, and eq. 2.8 can be generalized if one considers the whole emission spectrum of the fiber. In this way, we get a

Figure 2.6: Schematic drawing of a scintillating fiber.

convolution of different monochromatic single exponential functions:

\[I(x)=\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{0}(\lambda)\exp\left(-\frac{x}{L_{att}(\lambda)}\right)\,d\lambda \tag{2.9}\]

where \(I_{0}(\lambda)\) is the light yield (or scintillation response \(L\)), and \(L_{att}(\lambda)\) is the attenuation length. The light yield depends on the emission spectrum of the WLS die.

The light inside the scintillator is absorbed or attenuated by the following processes:

1. Self-absorption, due to overlap of emission and absorption spectra and existence of absorption centers (also called colour centers), due to impurities in the fiber.
2. The reflection coefficient of the core cladding and cladding air interface is less then 100% due to imperfections. When light is reflected by the surface of the core (or cladding), a fraction of it is lost.

Figure 2.7: Absorption and emission spectrum of a BCF91A WLS fiber. Taken from reference [33].

Both of the effects described above are wavelength dependent, justifying why the attenuation length is a function of \(\lambda\)

Experimentally fibers are well parameterized by the sum of two exponential functions, corresponding to:

* A long attenuation length which dominates in the region far from the read-out (typically \(>50\) cm). This long attenuation length is due to absorption of light traveling in the core of long wavelength (\(\lambda\sim 500-550nm\), corresponding to green).
* A short attenuation length dominating in the region near the readout. This short attenuation length is due in part to absorption of short wavelength light traveling in the core with \(\lambda<480nm\) (corresponding to blue and near UV), and in part due to light which was trapped and travels in the cladding.

The light output of a fiber is then parameterized by:

\[I(x)=I_{0\,S}\exp\left(-\frac{x}{L_{attS}}\right)+I_{0\,L}\exp\left(-\frac{x}{ L_{attL}}\right) \tag{2.10}\]

Where \(L_{attS}\) is the short attenuation length, \(L_{attL}\) is the long attenuation length and \(I_{0T}=I_{0\,S}+I_{0\,L}\) is the light yield. Fig. 2.8 shows a fit with eq. 2.10 to the light output of a BCF91A fiber as an example.

### 2.4 Sources of damage to plastic scintillators

_Radiation damage:_

The optical properties of plastic scintillating and WLS fibers are degraded when exposed to ionizing radiation. This degradation is reflected in a decrease of the light yield and attenuation length of the fibers.

The damage is due to a modification of the molecular chain of the base material, by scission of the chain or to cross-linking between adjacent chains, and to destruction of the dopants (primary and secondary fluor).

Figure 2.8: Fit with eq. 2.10 to the light output of a BCF91A fiber.

The destruction of the base material, leads to the formation of additional absorption centers, also called colour centers, [20][22]. These additional colour centers are due to the production of free radicals from the molecules of the base (absorbing UV light with a tail to the visible). The consequence is an increase of absorption of the light that travels inside the scintillator, in other words, a decrease of the attenuation length.

The destruction of the dopants leads to a decrease of the scintillation efficiency and consequently to a decrease in the light yield. It can also contribute to formation of additional absorption centers. From eq. 2.8, both effects lead to a global decrease of light output of scintillating and WLS fibers.

A large effort has been taken in pursuing radiation hard plastic scintillators and WLS for use in future p-p colliders (see for example [19]).

In general, radiation damage experiments are performed with high intensity \(\gamma\) sources. Experiments in mixed radiation fields of neutrons and \(\gamma\)'s were performed by A. Maio [13]. Several samples of S101A Oplectron scintillating fibers (47 cm length), were irradiated in a \({}^{60}Co\)\(\gamma\) source and in a nuclear reactor. Doses ranged from 250 krad to 2 Mrad (dose rate = 30 krad/h) in the \({}^{60}Co\)\(\gamma\) source, and from 44 krad to 8.8 Mrad (dose rate from 57 krad/h to 5.7 Mrad/h) in the mixed field of the nuclear reactor (\(\sim\) 40% of neutrons and \(\sim\) 60% of photons). The main conclusion was: comparing the radiation damage induced by the two fields (pure \(\gamma\) field and mixed \(\gamma\) plus neutron field), no difference was observed for the same total doses.

Similar conclusions are drawn by K. Wick and U. Holm [24]. They irradiated polystyrene base scintillator SCSN38 and PMMA base doped with Y7 WLS, in the mixed radiation field of a pool reactor (where 23% of the total dose is due fast neutrons and 77% to the \(\gamma\)-field). The total dose ranged from 200 krad to 10.5 Mrad. No difference was found in radiation damage when compared with pure \(\gamma\)-fields with similar released doses. They also performed an irradiation with 25 MeV protons in the same scintillators mentioned above [22], obtaining similar results of radiation damage as that of \({}^{60}Co\) irradiation.

_Natural ageing:_

The optical properties of plastic scintillators are degraded along time, that is,they suffer from natural ageing. This is a major concern for experiments that are to operate for several years, (as is the case of ATLAS). Natural ageing is primarily due to the scission of the polymer chain of the base material, and eventually to migration and evaporation of the dopants. As a consequence, the scintillation light decreases and the transparency of the scintillator is reduced. A maximum of \(\sim 4\%\) in light loss of the signal of the STIC luminosity monitor at DELPHI, was observed after two years of operation at LEP. The STIC is composed by the same type of scintillating tiles as TILECAL and by Y7 WLS fibers. The decrease was attributed only to natural ageing of the optical components, since there was no conclusive correlation which could be attributed to radiation damage (the estimated dose induced in the STIC detector for this 2 years was \(\sim 1\) krad). In other experiments [18], a light output decrease of \(\sim\)10% in 4 years was observed in PS base scintillators. An attenuation length decrease of \(\sim\)14%, was observed by K. Wick et al. [22], in SCSN38 scintillators during 1.5 years due to natural ageing. More details are given in section 2.5.

_Damage due to mechanical stress:_

This issue refers to plastic fibers. It is usual to bend fibers exposing them to mechanical stress. In the particular case of the TILECAL calorimeter, the WLS fibers have to be bent in the coupling to the PMT's (fig.1.3). This bending produces micro-cracks in the cladding from which the light traveling the fiber (fig.2.6) can escape, decreasing therefor the light output of the fibers. Very preliminary studies of several types of fibers under mechanical stress, were done in the framework of the TILECAL collaboration by Y. Protopopov [12]. The fragility of the fibers was measured as a ratio of attenuation length after/before bending, for 45 cm long fibers. The fibers under investigation were bended with the curvature diameters of 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20 cm and kept in this state during 100 hours. The typical behaviour of the WLS fibers is shown in Fig. 2.9. The relative attenuation length \(\lambda_{r}=\lambda_{afterbend}/\lambda_{beforebend}\) for Kuraray Y7 and Bicron BCF99-29A WLS fibers, is shown as a function of the bending diameter. In the diameter ranging from 10 to 15 cm, intensive cracking of the Y7 fiber started, this leads to a fast decreasing of attenuation length. The diameter 1.6 cm corresponds to the break point of Y7 fiber. This study was done with commercially available fibers in early 1993.

Preliminary tests of damage in WLS fibers due to mechanical stress, are presented in section 4.4.

### 2.5 Dose rate effects

The main question is: _can experiments of radiation damage in plastic scintillators with high dose rates, predict the radiation damage with much lower dose rate environments? And, what is the role of oxygen during and after the irradiation of such scintillators?_

A plastic scintillator suffers from low dose rate effect, when the damage caused by a high dose rate irradiation is lower than the damage caused by a lower dose rate irradiation, with the same total dose. This matter is a subject of large controversy, and the discussion will be divided in two parts: experiments in which

Figure 2.9: Stress resistance of fibers.

low dose rate effects were observed (section 2.5.1), and experiments in which no low dose rate effects were observed (section 2.5.2).

#### Experiments in which low dose rate effects were observed

1 - In 1985 Y. Sirois and R. Wigmans [14], reported on effects of a low dose rate exposure of a scintillator made of PMMA as base material, 10% naphthalene and 1% bPBD. The damage was due to uranium and in presence of oxygen. They observed a large decrease in attenuation length (\(\sim 67\%\)) with a total dose of 5 krad during 4 years, corresponding to \(\sim 0.2\) rad/h. The total dose is two orders of magnitude smaller, than what was expected to be a safe level of damage to this scintillator, less than 10% decrease in attenuation length after a 100 krad exposure. They attributed the effect to the combination of UV light emitted by the bPBD, and oxygen diffusing into the plastic. They explained this in the following way: the diffusion of oxygen into the scintillator, favors the creation of free radicals that break up the polymer structure of the base PMMA. In a fast term irradiation less oxygen is diffused into the samples, causing less damage than in long term irradiation.

2 - C. Zorn et al. [25], reported the results of a high dose rate irradiation of 2 Mrad/h, and a low dose rate irradiation of 550 rad/h and 670 rad/h with a total dose of 500 krad and 2 Mrad, respectively. They irradiated several types of plastic scintillating fibers with PS base in cluding, among others, Bicron-3HF and SCSF-81 scintillating fibers (see point number 6 of section 2.5.2). The fibers were irradiated in atmospheres of air and argon, and allowed to recover in air. All fibers tested, suffer the greatest level of damage on transmission when irradiated slowly in air (\(\sim 70/\%\) light loss for SCSF81 and \(\sim 30/\%\) for Bicron-3HF), and the least damage after recovery of the irradiation at a high dose rate (\(\sim 55/\%\) light loss for SCSF81 and \(<4/\%\) for Bicron-3HF) Fibers irradiated slowly in argon, have a level of damage which is intermediate between the other two (\(\sim 55/\%\) light loss for SCSF81 and \(\sim 10/\%\) for Bicron-3HF). An exception are the SCSF-Y8 fibers which present the same damage in the three irradiation conditions mentioned above.

**3** - N. D. Giokaris [26], has reported on radiation damage of the CDF1 beam-beam counters (BBC). The BBC's were made of SCSN23 scintillator plates, and experienced a drop of 40% in light yield and \(\sim\)85% in attenuation length during a collider run (almost one year). They installed some dosimeters after 2 months of the beginning of the run measuring thereafter about 2 to 4 krad (corresponding to a dose rate of \(\sim\)1rad/h). However, they also reported that in the first 2 months of the run, there had been total beam losses. This could have delivered an huge amount of dose to the scintillators. See also point number 7 of section 2.5.2.

Footnote 1: CDF is one of the experiments at the Tevatron \(p-\bar{p}\) collider.

**4** - E. Biagtan et al. [27], reported the results of radiation damage on plastic scintillating discs of SCSN38, SCSN81 and Bicron 499-35 with 2.5 cm diameter, and 4 mm thick. They irradiated the samples with 8 dose rate values ranging from 2.3 krad/h to 1.5 Mrad/h, with a constant total dose of 10 Mrad. The results can be seen in fig. 2.11 for the SCSN38 (top) and SCSN81 (bottom). This figure, shows the light output of the irradiated samples normalized to an un-irradiated sample of SCSN38 scintillator, as a function of the dose rate. A strong low dose rate effect is observed for all types of scintillators. The samples irradiated at lower dose rates present higher damage (\(\sim 75\%\) light output loss for SCSN38 and SCSN81), than the samples irradiated at higher dose rates (\(\sim 30\%\) light output loss for SCSN38 and SCSN81).

#### Experiments in which no low dose rate effects were observed

**1** - K. Wick and U. Holm have done systematic studies of radiation damage for the ZEUS calorimeter [20], [21], [22], [23] and [19] page 173, on scintillator and WLS plates. The scintillator is SCSN-38 and has a polystyrene (PS) base, 1% bPBD and 0.02% BDB as first and second fluors, respectively. The WLS bars have Y7 or K27 dyes plus a UV absorber (UVA) in PMMA base. They explained the irradiation and post-irradiation behaviour of the SCSN38 scintillator, by the diffusion of oxygen into the sample. Unstable radicals are produced creating colour centers and if oxygen is present, it will react with these radicals decreasing the absorption centers. Taking \(\mu_{0}\) as the initial optical absorption coefficient of the scintillator, and \(\mu(\,D)\) as the optical absorption coefficient after an induceddose \(D\) is delivered to the scintillator, then we have:

\[\Delta\mu(D)=\mu(D)-\mu_{0}=1/L_{att}(D)-1/L_{att0} \tag{2.11}\]

\(\Delta\mu(D)\) is the additional optical absorption coefficient of the scintillator after a dose \(D\), \(L_{att0}\) is the effective attenuation length before irradiation and \(L_{att}(D)\) the effective attenuation length after irradiation.

Fig 2.10 represents what happens to a cubic polystyrene sample after irradiation. The yellow or brown colour in the surface zone is bleached, becoming transparent at the rate of oxygen diffusion into the sample, and explaining the sharp demarcation between the coloured and transparent zone. On the other hand, when oxygen is not present, the recovery process only occurs by ion recombination (annealing). This last recovery process is much slower (of the order of months), than the one in the presence of oxygen (of the order of a few days). Still, a small permanent damage always remains after the recovery period. In this way, the geometry of the scintillator is also an important parameter in radiation damage studies. U. Holm and K. Wick [23], confirmed the dependence of \(\Delta\mu\) with the dimensions of the scintillator samples. The recovery of thicker samples takes longer time than that of thinner samples (as can be seen in fig.2.12).

The key point is that, if oxygen is present, a competition between destruction of the material by ionizing radiation and re-combination by oxygen diffusion into the scintillator, takes place. If the dose rate is lower than the rate of diffusion of oxygen into the sample then, the scintillator will have a similar damage has the permanent damage after recovery of a high dose rate irradiation. This can be seen in fig 2.12 taken from reference [23], which represents the dose rate dependency of \(\Delta\mu\) measured just after the end of irradiation for SCSN38, with a total dose of 24 kGy (2.4 Mrad).

2 - The same authors irradiated samples of SCSN38 (2.6 and 5 mm thick) [22] between depleted uranium plates, during several years up to total doses of a few krad, at a dose rate of 0.2 rad/h. A rough exponential decrease in attenuation length was observed. They attributed this behaviour to the natural ageing of the scintillator. Two 5 mm thick samples (one irradiated and the other not irradiated), showed a similar behaviour along time with a 14% decrease of the attenuation length, and converging for the same value. This means that no damage is observed due to radiation. For the 2.6 mm thick samples, the irradiated sample had 9% decrease in attenuation length, while the non-irradiated sample had only a 3% decrease. This is an apparent contradiction with the previous results for the 5 mm thick samples, but the initial attenuation length of the non irradiated sample was much lower than that of the irradiated one, and at the end of the irradiation both 2.6 mm thick samples had a similar attenuation length. They attributed this behaviour of the 2.6 mm thick samples, to the different pre-history ageing of the samples.

**3** - The PMMA base WLS bars behave different from PS base scintillators. The WLS Y7 and K27 dyes in PMMA base, were also studied by U. Holm and K. Wick. The recovery of such WLS in air is much longer (around 1 year), than the PS base scintillators. No recovery in inert atmospheres is observed, indicating that no annealing process occurs. For long term irradiation in air, recovery is observed only after the first 2 or 3 months following the end of irradiation. This indicates that oxygen is prevented from penetrating the PMMA during the first 2 or 3 months. They explained this in the following way: the oxygen reacts with gaseous irradiation products and light radicals (produced during PMMA irradiation), which diffuse out of the sample.

**4** - K. Wick and U. Holm did not observe dose rate effects in Y7 WLS bars [19] page 173. The samples were irradiated at dose rates of 264 krad/h and 670 rad/h, with a total dose of 590 krad and 280 krad, respectively. The irradiation and recovery took place in atmosphere of air. This is an apparent contradiction with the results from Sirois and Wigmans (point number 1 of section 2.5.1). They explained it in the following way: it is the UV light produced during irradiation in the scintillator which cause strong radiation damage in the presence of oxygen, but the Y7 WLS had an UV absorber so, this will not occur in UV absorbing WLS.

**5** - Systematic studies showing no dose rate dependence were obtained by the Lisbon group [13] and [11]. The dose rate dependence of scintillating fibers was studied. The pool of a nuclear reactor with a mixed radiation field of neutrons and \(\gamma\)'s (dose rates 57 krad/h, 570 krad/h and 5.7 Mrad/h), was used. The irradiation of S101A PS base scintillating fibers with a total dose of 1 Mrad, induced a decrease of \(\sim\) 20% in the light yield of the fibers, independently of the dose rate. In another set of experiments, the S101A fibers were irradiated in a \({}^{60}Co\gamma\) source (with a dose rate of 30 krad/h and a total dose of 1 Mrad), in an atmosphere of air and in "vacuum", and were allowed to recover in air. The irradiation in air induced a decrease of \(\sim 20\%\) in the light yield, with no recovery in 50 days. The irradiation in vacuum induced a decrease of \(\sim 95\%\) a few minutes after the end of irradiation, but recovering to about 25% after 5 days. This is consistent with the results obtained by U. Holm and K. Wick for PS base scintillators, that is, the recovery takes place during irradiation when in the presence of oxygen.

**6** - Later A. Gomes et al. [19] page 185, reported on irradiation of several types of plastic scintillating fibers with PS base, in a \({}^{60}Co\gamma\) source. Two dose rates (1.4 and 5.8 krad/h) were applied with a total dose of 500 krad. The fibers were irradiated under several atmospheres (air, dry air, argon and nitrogen), and were allowed to recover in air. No recovery of transmission is observed after irradiation in atmospheres with oxygen, consistent with the previous results from A. Maio, that is, recovery has taken place during irradiation. In inert atmospheres, a strong damage is observed just after irradiation, and is followed by a strong recovery in the first 4 days. The permanent damage is roughly equal to that in oxygenated atmospheres (see fig 2.13). On the other hand, no dose rate effect is observed after recovery. The permanent damage of fibers irradiated at 1.4 krad/h is roughly the same as that of fibers irradiated at 5.8 krad/h. The striking fact is that two fiber types, Bicron-3HF and SCSF-81 (see fibers listed in fig. 2.13), are common to the experiment reported by C. Zorn et al. in [25] (point number 2 of section 2.5.1), were low dose rate effects were observed for the scintillating fibers, and the effect of the type of atmosphere used, is contradictory in both experiments. The dose rates and total doses are similar, as well as the atmospheres.

**7** - Following point number 3 of section 2.5.1, N. D. Giokaris et al. [19] page 315, reported on irradiation of PS base scintillator bars (including the SCSN23). A \({}^{60}Co\) source was used to irradiate the samples at dose rate of 267 rad/h, with a total dose of 1.3 Mrad. No dose rate effects have been observed when they compared with irradiation made with higher dosrates (1.2 Mrad/h and 10 krad/h). The damage in the BBC remaining unexplained.

### 2.6 Parameterization of the optical properties of irradiated fibers

A model describing fully all the radiochemical and radiophysical effects on the optical properties of irradiated fibers, is not yet established and a lot of work needs to be done. However, experimental results for each type of scintillator with a certain shape and volume, shows that both scintillation and transmission of light decreases with increasing dose. Although the work reported in this thesis is essentially devoted to fibers, the following description is in principle also valid for scintillator plates.

The degradation in emission can be parameterized in the following way:

\[I_{0}[D(x)]=I_{0}(D=0)\exp\left(-\frac{D(x)}{\delta}\right) \tag{2.12}\]

\(D\) is the total dose, \(I_{0}(D=0)\) is the original light yield in the absence of radiation and \(\delta\) is the parameter which characterizes the loss in emission.

The loss in transmission can be parameterized by:

\[k[D(x)]=k_{0}+\alpha\times D(x) \tag{2.13}\]

\(k_{0}=1/L_{att}\) is the optical absorption coefficient before irradiation and \(\alpha\) characterizes the loss in light transmission. \(\alpha\times D\) is the additional absorption when the fiber is submitted to a total dose \(D\). Eq. 2.13 is the same as eq. 2.11 with: \(\Delta\mu=\alpha\times D\). Usually \(\mu\) is used when the optical absorption coefficient of thin samples of scintillator is referred, while \(k\) is used for fibers as the inverse of the attenuation length.

The light output after irradiation is deduced in appendix B, from eq. 2.8, 2.12 and 2.13 giving:

\[I(x,D)=I_{0}\exp\left(-x\times k_{0}-\frac{D(x)}{\delta}-\alpha\times\int_{0} ^{\pi}D(s)ds\right) \tag{2.14}\]

Radiation hard scintillators and WLS are characterized by high values of \(\delta\) and low values of \(\alpha\). These parameters will be evaluated for the fibers studied in this work in chapter 4, and will be used for comparison purposes.

So, the strategy followed by the different groups and industries involved in the R&D activities related to scintillating and WLS fibers and tiles, in order to select the most adequate to a certain experiment are:

1. Assuming that the parameters \(\delta\) and \(\alpha\) described by eqs. 2.12 and 2.13, are valid and adequate to describe the optical properties of irradiated fibers (and tiles).
2. Assuming that the relevant parameters should refer to the permanent damage.
3. Define the limits accepted for \(\delta\) and \(\alpha\) or, the decrease in the light output of the fibers and tiles.
4. Submit the fibers and tiles to radiation tests at doses as low as allowed by irradiation facilities, and available time for tests.
5. Contact with enterprises in order to improve the radiation hardness of the scintillators.
6. With the present available fibers and tiles, compute the _lifetime of the detector_.

The decision on which fibers will be used for the TILECAL detector will be taken only in 1998. Till then, the team is testing new fibers in all aspects: light yield and light transmission before and after irradiation, natural ageing, flexibility and mechanical stress, mechanical tolerance and last but not least, the cost. Till now, the fiber that offers the best properties is the Kuraray Y11(200)MS, but it is also the most expensive.

## Chapter 3 Irradiation setup and dosimetry

### 3.1 Irradiation setup

A \({}^{60}Co^{1}\) source was used from a radiosterilization facility, _"Unidade de Tecnologias de Radiacao"_ (UTR) in _"Instituto Tecnologico Nuclear"_ (ITN) at Lisbon. The irradiation setup is shown in fig. 3.1.

Several cylinders containing chips of \({}^{60}Co\) constitute the source. The intensity is very high (\(>\)25 krad/h at 10 cm from the source) so, in order to uniformise the dose rate in an area of 20x150 cm\({}^{2}\), and obtain the profiles shown in fig. 3.2, several shieldings of lead and cooper were built.

The first shielding is the steel support of the source, followed by a 9 mm lead plate. Position \(A\) has a lead shield constituted by a plate with different thickness depending on height (as shown in fig. 3.3-left), followed by a 3 mm cooper plate. The fibers are inserted in 1 cm diameter aluminum tubes, whose ends are buried in 3 mm thick lead tubes and in a 5 cm thick lead casing (see fig. 3.3-right).

Positions \(B\) and \(C\) have similar shield structures as position \(A\), with the following difference: the lead plates thickness are constant, being 1.5 cm for position \(B\) and 2 cm for position \(C\). Position \(B\) is 80 cm farther from position \(A\), and position \(C\) is 130 cm farther from position \(A\).

Figure 3.1: Irradiation facility.

The dose profiles obtained with these shieldings are the following:

* Position A: a negligible doserate (\(<\)200 rad/h) between 0 and 50 cm and a mean doserate of 3.9 krad/h in the plateau from 50 to 200 cm, with a RMS of 14%.
* Position B: a negligible doserate (\(<\)30 rad/h) between 0 and 50 cm and a mean doserate of 1.1 krad/h in the plateau from 50 to 200 cm, with a RMS of 9%.
* Position C: a negligible doserate (\(<\)30 rad/h) between 0 and 50 cm and a mean doserate of 0.53 krad/h in the plateau from 50 to 200 cm, with a RMS of 7%.

### 3.2 Dosimetry and simulation of dose profile

In the past, irradiation of scintillating fibers were performed. Part of the results are presented in the next chapter and part were presented elsewhere by A. Gomes et al. in [19] page 185.

Figure 3.2: Envisaged doserate profile.

Figure 3.3: Lead shield from irradiation position A (left). Fibers support structure (right).

For this study, dosimetry was made with Elcugray alanine cables (4.8 mm diameter). Three 2 m long alanine cables were inserted in the aluminum tubes (the same which later support the fibers for irradiation), one for each position and irradiated during \(\sim 73\) hours. The alanine cables are then cut in 3 cm alanine pieces, and the total dose deposited in each piece is measured by electron spin resonance (ESR), obtaining the dose at each position.

In the beginning, the irradiation setup had only positions \(A\) and \(B\), and the dose rate profile for these positions was similar to fig. 3.2. To perform irradiation at lower dose rates, it was necessary to implement a third position with a dose rate of the order of 0.5 krad/h. So, in order to design the shielding necessary to obtain such dose rate, and to predict the dose rates in the 3 positions, a computer simulation using the Monte Carlo code **EGS4** (Electron **Gama** Shower), was performed. The geometry of the irradiation setup (as shown in figs. 3.1 and 3.3), was introduced in the code and \(10^{7}\) events were generated. In one event, two photons with energies of 1.333 MeV and 1.173 MeV (characteristic of \({}^{60}Co\)), with random direction and generation point inside the source, are generated.

Fig. 3.4 shows the dose rate as a function of height in the irradiation facility, for positions \(A\), \(B\) and \(C\) measured with the alanine cables, and also the results of the simulation. The dose profiles obtained by simulation, were globally normalized to the point \(x\)=58 cm of position \(A\). As can be seen, the dose profile obtained by simulation agrees satisfactorily with the experimental results. The previous knowledge of the dose rate for positions \(A\) and \(B\), gave confidence in the simulation, allowing to predict a dose rate between 500 rad/h and 600 rad/h for position \(C\) if, a 2 cm thick lead shield is used.

Presently, it is possible to irradiate uniformly the fibers along \(\sim 1\) m, with a dose rate of \(\sim\)4 krad/h, 1.1 to 1.2 krad/h and 520 to 600 rad/h in the plateau, with an almost negligible dose in the first 50 cm of fiber (\(<200\) rad/h in position A and \(<30\) rad/h in positions B and C).

This particular profile was chosen to allow the separation of light emission and transmission loss in the irradiated fibers. In the small steeply region where the plateau starts, the light loss is due only to emission loss. Along the plateau of constant dose, there is the combined effect of a constant emission loss plus the transmission loss, that can be estimated using eq. 2.14.

Figure 3.4: Dose profile for position A (top), B (middle) and C (bottom) - experimental and simulated results.

## Chapter 4 Radiation hardness test of scintillating and WLS fibers

### 4.1 Radiation damage in scintillating fibers

The optical properties of plastic fibers for calorimetric applications, can be characterized in terms of the light yield and attenuation length. In the past, several devices were constructed for the measurement of these quantities. In the simplest configuration one single fiber is scanned longitudinally by a radioactive source, and the light produced in the fiber is read by a photomultiplier. This type of device was used in the measurement of scintillating fibers for the SPACAL calorimeter, namely in radiation hardness studies [19] page 185, [28].

In this work, the following scintillating fibers were studied:

1. Kuraray: SCSF81, 3HF(200) and 3HF(400)
2. Optectron: S101-A

The fibers were irradiated and allowed to recover in air. The applied dose profile is shown in fig 4.1. The dose rate was \(\sim 1.5\) krad/h along 1.5 m (position B of fig. 3.1) and the total dose was \(\sim 500\) krad.

Fibers with the 3HF fluor are _'green'_ while the others are _blue._ The fibers have 220 cm length, 1 mm diameter and were polished at both ends. 6 blue fibers ofeach type and 3 green fibers of each type were irradiated.

The setup used in the measurements of radiation damage of scintillating fibers, is shown in fig 4.2. A 1 cm diameter \({}^{90}Sr-\beta\) source was used to excite the fibers. The source was positioned at the required position along the fiber, using a remote controlled step motor with GPIB interface and a Macintosh. The fiber end is connected to a XP2081B (green extended photocathod) PMT through a light guide. The optical coupling fiber - light guide and light guide - photocathod is air. The blue fibers were also measured with a Kodak wratten # 3 filter which cuts off wavelength bellow 450 nm, inserted between the light guide and the PMT. The filter was used because of two main reasons:

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:55]

In the bottom of these figures, it is shown the corresponding values with the blue fibers (S101A and SCSF81) measured with the Kodak wratten # 3 filter.

Blue fibers measured with filter show less damage both in emission and transmission than the same fibers measured without filter. This is consistent with observations from other authors [25], that is: scintillators emitting in shorter wavelengths are less radiation hard than scintillators emitting in longer wavelengths. This can in part explain why 3HF green fibers are radiation harder than blue fibers. On the other hand, the fluor 3HF is known to be radiation hard [32].

A recovery of the transmission of the green fibers is observed after 7 days of the end of irradiation. No further recovery is observed after that period, as can be seen in fig. 4.4 for 3HF(400) fibers (the ratio is not normalized to the region of 0 dose in the first 50 cm). Peculiarly, the 3HF(200) fibers present a higher transmission loss after 6 months of the end of irradiation, but the higher error in the transmission loss parameter \((\alpha)\), compared with the other fibers (table 4.3), indicates that some uncontrolled error happened to these fibers, or during their measurement.

The blue fibers measured without filter, present an increasing transmission loss with time. The measurement with filter yields a different recovery behaviour. The S101-A fibers recover about 15% after 20 days, and the SCSF81 fibers recover \(\sim 14\%\) within 7 days and thereafter the transmission loss increases. Other authors [29], have observed a similar behaviour in polystyrene base scintillators: after irradiation, they observed a recovery of the light output up to a certain maximum, and thereafter an increase of light loss along time.

The errors on \(\alpha\) are less than 5% (except 3HF(200) after 6 months), indicating low fiber to fiber fluctuations and good determination of this fit parameter.

The emission loss \(\delta\) has much larger errors (as high as 50% in same cases) than the transmission loss \(\alpha\). This is due to a large uncertainty in this fit parameter. In the present study the total dose is 500 krad, so if we put \(\delta=10\) Mrad in eq. 2.12, this gives light yield decrease of 5%. If, for example, we put \(\delta=25\) Mrad in eq. 2.12 the light yield decreases only 2%. This leads us to the conclusion that, the emission loss is less important than the transmission loss (for the total dose applied in this work).

Some conclusions can be drawn from this study:

1. Before irradiation, the 3HF scintillating fibers have a light yield and attenuation length similar to the SCSF81 fibers.
2. Before irradiation, the SCSF81 fibers have a light output much higher than the S101-A fibers due to a higher light yield and attenuation length.
3. The measurement with filter yields higher \(\delta\)'s and lower \(\alpha\)'s, which means that emission and transmission of shorter wavelengths (blue) are more suppressed than longer wavelengths (green) by irradiation. That is, fibers emitting at longer wavelengths (green) are much less sensitive to ionizing radiation than fibers emitting at shorter wavelengths (blue).
4. 3HF green fibers are much more radiation hard than blue fibers, even when the blue fibers are measured with a filter that cuts lower wavelengths.
5. Within the blue fibers, the Oplectron S101-A fibers are more radiation hard than Kuraray SCSF81 fibers.
6. For green fibers, a recovery is seen, within 7 to 20 days after the end of irradiation.
7. For blue fibers, the recovery behaviour of emission loss is similar to that of transmission loss.

Some of these results are contradictory with the ones obtained by B. Tome [8]. They irradiated, among others, SCSF81, 3HF(200) and 3HF(400) scintillating fibers inside a lead matrix in a SPACAL like test module, with a 1.1 GeV electron

beam, to a total dose of 2.7 Mrad. All the fibers, including the 3HF, were measured with the Kodak wratten # 3 filter. The parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\delta\) were extracted for these fibers with one week of recovery.

Table 4.2 shows the values of the transmission loss parameter \(\alpha\) obtained in this study (second column), and the ones obtained by B. Tome (third column). B. Tome observed a higher transmission loss for the 3HF(400) fibers than for the 3HF(200) fibers, while we have observed a similar transmission loss for both types of fibers. For the SCSF81 fibers, B. Tome observed a lower transmission loss than the 3HF(400) fibers, while in our experiment the 3HF(400) fibers were found to be radiation harder than the SCSF81 fibers. As stated previously, the development the fibers and the testing of their optical properties and radiation damage is done almost simultaneously, and the fibers from different production cycles can have somewhat different properties.

We do not compare the values of the emission loss parameter \(\delta\), because the values obtained in this work have large errors.

One of the possible choices of calorimeters to be used in the ATLAS detector, until early 1993, was the SPACAL calorimeter (see reference [2]). A R&D on radiation damage in scintillating fibers has been carried out, in which the Portuguese group was deeply involved. The composition of the scintillating fibers that were tested, had polystyrene base and PMMA cladding like the WLS fibers being tested for the TILECAL calorimeter. Further, the volume of the scintillating fibers is similar to that of the WLS fibers, that is, a 1 millimeter diameter and 200 - 220 cm long. In this way, the radiation hardness of both types of optical fibers should be similar, or at least in what concerns the loss in the optical transmission2.

Footnote 2: The loss in optical transmission, due to ionizing radiation, is closely related to destruction or changes in the base material, as was discussed in section 2.4

The first estimates for the survival of calorimeters with scintillating tiles and WLS fibers for LHC (for example, the Shaslik electromagnetic calorimeter3 ), were based on the results of radiation damage for the SPACAL calorimeter.

The Fibrometer

The main disadvantage of the previous fibrometer setup is the dead time between the measurement of each fiber. An important improvement was achieved by introducing an additional degree of freedom perpendicular to the movement of the radioactive source. With this configuration, several fibers can be installed in a supporting table that is moved to position the selected fiber in front of the readout system, and the dead time is largely reduced. The quality control of the scintillating fibers equipping the CHORUS calorimeters was also undertaken with this type of device [30] and [31].

The test bench is schematically shown in fig. 4.7. It consists of a X-Y Micro-Control optical table, provided with two independent movements driven by two stepping motors along orthogonal directions (\(\mathbf{X}\) and \(\mathbf{Y}\)). It is complemented by a light readout system. A 3 meters long table is moved in the X direction. This table supports a removable holder that contains the fibers to be tested. Each fiber is positioned in front of the light readout, and the Y motor moves the radiation source along the fiber length. At each position the light output from that fiber is recorded. The test bench is automatically controlled by a MacIntosh Personal Computer through GPIB interfaces. A dedicated software was developed for this purpose using the LabView 4 package.

Footnote 4: ©National Instruments

The XY table consists of three main components: The main support (which is fixed), the supporting table (which moves within the defined X-axis) and the radiation source holder (which moves within the defined Y-axis). The movement of the radiation source holder was proved to be parallel to the table within a few tenth of a millimeter. The movement of the table ensures a constant distance of all the fibers to the PMT within a precision of the order of 50 \(\mu\)m. The supporting table is loaded with the fibers holder. This table is displaced along the X-axis and its position is controlled in steps of 25 \(\mu\)m. In fig. 4.8 it is shown a cross view of the supporting table and one fiber holder.

One reference fiber is inserted in a black painted groove drilled along the table length, and is tightly attached to the supporting table. The signal from this fixed reference, fiber provides a monitorization of the stability of the readout chain and radiation source. Each fiber holder consists of a mat black anodizedFigure 4.7: The test bench: a) side view; b) top view.

aluminum plate with 33 V-shaped grooves to receive one fiber each. The distance between adjacent grooves is 3 mm. The central groove is 5 mm apart from the neighbours and receives one reference fiber. This fiber is removed and reinserted whenever the holder is filled with new fibers, and undergoes the same alignment procedure together with the other fibers. Four fiber holders were designed - one pair is 60 cm long and the other is 300 cm long. They are used according to the length of the fibers to be tested. The use of two identical holders is crucial in minimizing the dead time. One set of fibers is automatically measured while the second holder is filled with new fibers.

The radiation source holder is displaced along the Y-axis and its position is controlled in steps of 100 \(\mu\)m. The test bench is provided with two alternative sources of radiation. When testing scintillating fibers, a \({}^{90}\)Sr radioactive source is used. If the fibers to test are WLS fibers, then a blue scintillator (injection molded polystyrene doped with 1.5% PTP and 0.05% POPOP, TILECAL type) is inserted in front of the \({}^{90}\)Sr source. The electrons from the source excite the scintillator, and the blue light produced is absorbed by the WLS fiber which re-emits it in a longer wavelength. To enhance the light output, the scintillator is wrapped with aluminized mylar. A schematic illustration of this assembly is shown in fig. 4.9. In this work, the WLS fibers were also excited directly with the \({}^{90}\)Sr source, to study the response of the fibers to ionizing particles. Especially in the comparison of fibers with and without UV absorber ( UVA).

Figure 4.8: Cross view of the supporting table and one fiber holder.

On the X-axis, the movement is transmitted from the motor to the table using a screw. On the Y-axis, the movement of the radiation source holder is achieved using a profiled rubber tape. Both motors are connected to an electronically controlled power unit, driven by the MacIntosh PC via General Purpose Instrumentation Bus (GPIB) interfaces. As the position of the table on the X-axis is considered to be critical, the corresponding stepping motor is provided with a built-in opto-electrical system that will warn the operator, if the number of steps performed by the motor does not correspond to the command sent to it. Such system is not available for the motor controlling the Y-axis movement.

Two major functions are found in the TL78 and IP28 MicroControl units: the TL78 takes care of the power feeding to the motors and the IP28 sends out the proper signals to the motors via the TL78.

The TL78 also features the possibility of directly controlling the position of the table (X-axis) with the help of a real time display of its position (7 segments LEDs display). An additional LED, provides a visual warning whenever a mismatch between the number of steps made by the motor and the requested

Figure 4.9: The radiation source-scintillator assembly used when testing WLS fibers.

number of steps has occurred. The IP28 is an intelligent stepping motor controller, optimized to reduce the possibility of under or over-run of the motor. It will automatically progressively increase the pulse rate during the initial phase of the movement, and decrease it before reaching the end of the movement. The only information it needs is the total number of steps and the axis of movement. It can additionally be controlled manually using push buttons on its front panel.

The light readout system consists of a blue sensitive EMI 9813KB photomultiplier (PM) coupled to a light guide. The signal from the PM is read and integrated by a Schlumberger 7150plus digital multimeter (DMM). The PM and light guide are enclosed in a cylindrical metallic housing with a light opaque black disc fixed at the end near the fibers. This disc has a diameter of 55 mm and a thickness of 300 \(\mu m\), with a 1 cm height and 2 mm wide slit at the center. The slit allows the detection of the light from the selected fiber, while avoiding the light from the neighboring fibers as illustrated in fig. 4.10. The contribution from one neighboring fiber to the signal of the fiber that is centered with the slit, defines the light cross talk. It is determined by the distance between the two adjacent fibers and the size of the gap between the fibers and the slit.

A detailed study of the cross talk between adjacent fibers was performed in [33], showing that the slit dimension has some influence in the measured attenuation length. Special care is mandatory when testing and comparing different

Figure 4.10: The role of the slit to cut the light from the fibers adjacent to the selected one. Dashed slit without fiber.

types of fibers, and the slit dimension must be carefully defined. It was chosen for this study a fiber to fiber distance of 6 mm (one groove with fiber and the adjacent grooves without fiber), a slit with 2 mm and the fiber to light guide distance of \(\sim 1\) mm. This setup was proven [8] and [33], to give a cross talk of less than 0.5%.

The movements of both motors and the readout of the DMM, is automatically controlled by the MacII personal computer. A dedicated software was developed using the National Instruments LabView 2.1 (**LABoratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench**) package. The interface with the user is provided by a front panel (shown in fig. 4.11), where several parameters can be checked and/or modified. The program also controls the on-line data analysis, consisting mainly on the evaluation of the light yield and attenuation length for the measured fibers. These, are obtained by an exponential fit to the light output attenuation pattern. The results are presented in a report page as shown in fig. 4.12. It contains, besides some relevant data concerning the measurement of the reference fiber and the noise level, a table displaying the results of the on-line analysis. Also, a graphic with the light output as a function of the source position is drawn for each fiber. This report page is very useful for a real time control of the ongoing measurements, and an efficient trouble handling. The raw data and the results of the on-line analysis are also stored on disk.

#### Systematics

As described in the previous section, several fibers can be measured in one run. For this study the following configuration was chosen: each holder contains 15 fibers to be tested, plus 2 reference fibers (chosen to be BCF91A), one in the first groove and another in the middle groove of the holder. These reference fibers are exchanged between the two holders being used to control the insertion and alignment in the holder, and its placement in the Fibrometer table. They will be called as movable reference fibers.

Additionally, one reference fiber (also BCF91A), is fixed inside the Fibrometer, (see fig. 4.8). This fiber is 2.2 m long and aluminized at the end opposite to the readout. This fiber controls changes in the signal along the time, and is measured at the beginning and at the end of each run. It should be noted,Figure 4.11: Front panel of the on-line monitoring program.
