There are at present two design options for the assembly of the Tile-Calorimeter modules. The first option (CERN/Barcelona) proposes to assembly of the calorimeter modules using a bonding technique. The second is a U.S. Tile-Calorimeter module (1) meter modules using a bonding technique, tensioned strap technique, collaboration (Argonne) option, using a compression, tensioned strap technique for construction of the one (1) meter modules. Each of these designs requires the different tolerancing based on certain assumptions about the final assembly of the calorimeter. This note is to explain the differences, the requirements, and the subsequent costs related to tolerancing.

Design Options

The difference between the Argonne and CERN design options is the presence surfaces. Figure 1 illustrates the Argonne option where the reference datum planes are the centerline of the plates (datum A) as defined by the key at the outer radius and the surface of the outer radius key slots (datum B). 1 is 2 illustrates the CERN design option, where the centerline reference is defined the holes used for the calibration sources. These holes locate the plates in both radial and \(\phi\) direction. It is my understanding that one edge of the plate with the used during stacking to prevent both twist and Z direction curvature of the stack. It should be noted that using both of these references is ambiguous, only one or the other can be used for plate-to-plate alignment. The edge ref only serves to align the stack.

Tolerancing for the Argonne Option

In the case of the Argonne option, the required tolerances are less than 2. The reason for this is twofold. One, this design assumes that the m of the final assembly are supported at the inner and outer radius, or at the radius and the ends. Two, there is a significant cost saving if ordinary hh of steel plate can be used in place of a cold reduced plate, which is somewhat expensive.

Tolerances that Effect the Module \(\phi\) Angle Envelope

If a broader tolerance is used, a designed gap can be created in the between the modules to accommodate the variation in the envelope size. At present is thought to be at least one (1) millimeter, allowing the tolerate slope of the module to extend.5 mm above and below the nominal dimensions of each side as shown in Fig. 4. This tolerance envelope is a result of plate ring and the outer plate dimension as it relates to the position of the key (i.e. stacking process. The manufacturing tolerance of the individual plate is in Fig. 3. The tolerances of the individual components, and how they are overall assembled unit, are listed separately below. We will attempt to use of these in turn and explain how they effect the overall dimensional en * **Cause:** The tolerance related to the outer radius key slot, and its center position, referenced to datum A. **Effect:** The key ways position, relative to the plate's center line, has an effect on the right to left position of the plate in the final assembly. See Fig. 5.
* **Cause:** The tolerance of the included angle of the edges of the plate. **Effect:** As the angle increases or decreases it effects the location of the corners of the plate, and therefore affects the width of the plate. See Fig. 6.
* **Cause:** The tolerance related to the width dimension of the key slot. **Effect:** The key way width has an effect on the right-to-left position of the plate in the final assembly. See Fig. 7.
* **Cause:** The tolerance related to the width of the outer radius key of the outer radius plate. **Effect:** The key width has an effect on the right-left position of the plate in the final assembly. See Fig. 8.
* **Cause:** The tolerance on the clearance between the outer radius key and the key slot. **Effect:** This tolerance effects the right-to-left position of the plate in the final assembly. See Fig. 9.

In the worst case condition, all of the tolerances can accumulate with the result shown in Fig. 10.

**Tolerances that Effect the Z Axis Length of the Module**

The above description applies only to the tolerancing of the plate size and the positioning of the slots, holes, and key slots. The other dimension, that must be considered, is the thickness of the plates and how it relates to the Z length of the completed one (1) meter modules. In the Argonne scheme, it is intended that by using standard hot-rolled plate we can achieve a tolerance of \(\pm\).004 in. on the entire lot of steel. Assuming that this is true, the stack buildup is periodically corrected by inserting a correction plate that will bring the accumulative dimension back to nominal. Even when this correction is made, it will still leave a plus and minus tolerance on the Z dimension. It is therefore proposed to leave a design gap of.5 mm between one (1) meter modules. This condition is also illustrated in Fig. 4, and the tolerances that effect the Z dimension are discussed below.

* **Cause:** The thickness tolerance of the master and spacer plates.

**Effect:**: The potential growth or reduction in the Z dimension of the Z-axis module can vary by a large amount. If one assumes the minimum on these plate thicknesses, the potential growth can be as much as.1 mm per plate which results in an overall growth of 22 mm. This is unacceptable without correction. Even when the correction, there remains a Z dimension tolerance on a 1 mm.
**Effect:**: The systematic out of parallelism of the plates, can result in a corrected by a systematic reversal of the plates, can result in an out of parallel condition of the two surfaces on a 1 mm.
**Totalerancing for the CERN Bonded Stack Design Option**: In an attempt to compare and understand the tolerancing for the bulk stack design option, we conducted a similar study. It is clear that although the individual tolerances are different, they have similar effects on the assembly of envelope. There has been no attempt, at this time, to apply numbers to the tolerances, but only to identify them and their effect. These tolerances are the listed below.
**Tolerances that Effect the Module # Angle Envelope**: 1. Cause: The tolerance of the included angle of the edges of the plate, the centerline as represented by the source calibration.
**Effect:**: The angle increases or decreases the width of the plate, the corners, and therefore increases or decreases the size of the module envelope. See Fig. 11.
**Effect:**: The tolerance related to the side of the plate.
* **Cause:** The flatness of the alignment plate that aligns the edges of the plates during stacking. _Effect:_ Allows surface variations equal to the out of flatness of this surface, this in turn allows a variation in the size of the module envelope. See Fig. 14.

Tolerances that Effect the Z Axis Length of the Module

* **Cause:** The thickness tolerance of the master and spacer plates. _Effect:_ A buildup in the overall module length. This buildup, if the material thickness is specified as +0.00/-075 mm, can result in a length variation of 16.5 mm without correction. Up to four plates, or two half periods, will have to be deleted from the 1 meter stack to compensate for this condition.
* **Cause:** The tolerance on the glue line thickness. _Effect:_ If the numbers are correct, the intended adhesive can vary from.05 mm to.2 mm (from a paper sent to me by J. Blocki). This can be controlled to a specific dimension by the compression of the stack, but absolute control will be difficult. The variation in the final dimension of each 25 cm stack becomes the tolerance for the Z dimension of a 1 meter module. It will be difficult to control this final dimension unless squeeze out of the adhesive is allowed.
* **Cause:** The tolerance of the position of the alignment holes relative to each other. _Effect:_ If the hole spacing varies, it will result in some buckling of the plate between the holes, which in turn will cause a change in the Z dimension. This will be accommodated by the adhesive, but will result in a buildup in the overall module length unless corrected.

Cost Implications

The tolerances on the thickness of the raw plates, and the dimensional arrangement of the system, are the positions tolerances applied in the case of the raw plate thickness, the difference in cost can be a small project cost. In the case of the resolution based on the processing required is listed below.

Conclusion

In both design options, the tolerances allow enough uncertainty about the amount of material. The results are shown in both design options, the solution must be found to compensate for the amount of material. The results are shown in the European specification, and the results are shown in the European specification.

Recommendation

We would recommend that designed gaps be used with either (i.e., since both will require some correction, and accept the reduced plate thickness. Incorporation of this suggestion, will result in a prediction of the reduced cost for the material.
