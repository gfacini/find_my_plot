**Introduction**

**In our effort to familiarize ourselves with the work that has been done to date on the design of the Tile Cal hadron calorimeter for Atlas, we have undertaken a thorough examination of the current designs.**

**We concentrated on the work that has been done by the IHEP Group at**

**Protvino, and in particular the work presented at the last Atlas Week by Mr.**

**A. Surkov. We have constructed six different finite element models as we have learned more about the system. These models were meant to be rough models only and do not represent actual construction in all cases. In some cases, shortcuts were taken in an attempt to set boundary conditions and to reduce the size of the problem to accommodate software limitations, while still providing enough information to further our understanding.**After reviewing the analysis and thinking about the construction, we have some suggested modifications, which will be shown later in this paper. It is clear that the work done at both CERN and Protvino has been impressive and thorough. We have tried to evaluate and understand both the CERN baseline design and the suggested design option from Protvino. We concentrated on the Protvino option since it has the most detail.

### Analysis

_Case # 1_

In Case 1 the structural back beam of the module was modeled. The beam was gravity loaded using the six meter module at the 12:00 o'clock position, and simply supported at the two ends (see Fig 1). This model displayed the expected deflections and stresses in the beam. It should be noted that each model represents only a one quarter section, since the system's cross sections have two axes of symmetry as shown in Fig. 2.

_Case # 2_

In Case 2, the master plates were added and fixed to the back beam and to the inner radius by a continuous front plate. This model only uses only 120 master plates in an attempt to reduce the number of nodes and elements and thereby shortening the computer run time. This case is illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4.

_Case # 3_

The third model was enhanced by adding tie rods through the entire length of the module. These rods were fixed at both ends but only coupled to the master plates in the radial direction, to compensate for the anticipated deflection of the system. Again, in an attempt to reduce the problem, only nine of the rods equally spaced radially were used in this model. This case is illustrated in Fig. 5.

_-2._Case # 4

In Case 4 the tie rods were decoupled at four submodule boundaries. Four modules were chosen to reduce the problem. This case is illustrated in Fig. 5.

Cases # 5 and 6

These two cases were modeled to establish an upper boundary on the stiffness of the system. The stiffness was imparted by fixing all nodes with beam elements at the locations where tie rods would run through the plates. In these cases, three beam elements were used in the \(\phi\) direction and nine rows radially resulting in 27 rods through the module. This is illustrated in Fig. 6.

The maximum deflections and combined stresses for Cases 1 through 6 are illustrated in Table 1.

**Conclusions from the Analysis**

As a result of the completed analyses, there remains two concerns with the present designs. Our primary concern is the calculation of the stresses in the tie rods as calculated by M. Surkov. We agree with the calculation, but question the assumption of.5 mPa compression load. As described the compression load may not be sufficient to completely flatten the steel sheets. When U.S. standards for flatness are used, the loads may not be adequate to flatten the sheets. We offer the following calculations as explanation.

**The stresses in the tie rods and straps due to plate compression are shown in Table 2.**

**Table 2**

**Stresses on Straps or Rods Due to Plate Compression**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & Rod Stress & Strap Stress \\ Plate Compressive Load & (22 rods) & (11 Layers of 4 Straps) \\ \hline
**.5 MPa** & 277.3 MPa & 39.2 MPa \\  & (40,220 psi) & (5,686 psi) \\ \hline
**.28 MPa** & 154.3 MPa & 21.84 MPa \\ (single node) & (22,370 psi) & (3,167 psi) \\ \hline
**5.2 MPa** & 2,860 MPa & 404.9 MPa \\ (multi-node) & (414,800 psi) & (58,730 psi) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**We point out that these calculations are a worst case condition, and may not occur. When addressing the stresses on the rods, there are three sources to consider.**

1. **Load due to plate compression.**
2. **Loads due to bending of the system.**
3. **Tensile load due to bending of the system.**

**This condition is most severe when tie rods pass through the entire six meter module. However, the system stiffness is at maximum in this condition.**

**The second concern relates to the thickness tolerance of the plates and how this affects the z length of the module. Assuming the best thickness tolerance achievable with current U.S. technology is** \(\pm\)**.004 in. (**\(\pm\)**.1 mm), and using** **= 1300 plates, the tolerance envelope for the module length** \(=\pm\)**130 mm without correction.**

**If one chooses 40 plates as a stack progression, and a compression measurement is made after each 40 half periods, it is conceivable that correcting plates could be inserted to re-adjust the stack, i.e., having master plates that are both 6 mm and 4mm. These plates could be used to correct for growth and reduction in stack dimension. The frequency of measurement and correction can be increased if necessary. One might expect that in any single batch of steel the tolerances might all be either high or low and therefore random sorting and stacking may be required to minimize stack build up or reduction.

### Argonne Design Option

In response to our previously expressed concerns and based on our own past experience, Argonne would like to suggest a variation of the existing design. The reasons for suggesting this variation are as follows:

1. The load distribution due to compression, using only tie bolts through the center line of the module, allows fanning of the plates of their outside edges. A more uniform distribution of load is preferred.
2. The requirement that the scintillator be stacked as part of the absorber construction involves risk of damage to the scintillator.
3. The construction of the absorber could be considered as an industry task independent of laboratory tasks.
4. Holes through the scintillator, without large clearances, could result in damage where tie bolts contact scintillator as modules are deformed under load.
5. Independent submodules, as suggested by Protvino, allow many institutions to participate in the instrumentation and final assembly of the modules without large expenditures for multiple tooling. In an attempt to respond to these criteria, we offer the following design option:We substitute flat straps in rows of 4 each in 11 radial positions as illustrated in Figs. 7-10.
* The master plates and spacers for each half period are illustrated in Figs. 11-13.
* The final assembly is shown in an exploded view in Fig. 14.

U.S. Plate Production Cost

The following Table 3 illustrates the estimated costs to produce the required steel plates in the U.S. (USD).
