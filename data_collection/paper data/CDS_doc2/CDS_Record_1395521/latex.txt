###### Abstract

The LHC foresees a peak luminosity increase of up to \(\sim 5\times 10^{34}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\) from \(\sim\)2022 with an integrated luminosity of \(\sim 3000\,{\rm fb}^{-1}\) before 2030. The current ATLAS Inner Detector will not stand the predicted radiation levels nor the expected large increase in the hit occupancy rates. A new inner tracker must therefore be designed, built and installed in a relatively short time-scale. The current layout assumes an all-silicon tracker with pixel detectors for the innermost layers and strip modules at higher radii. Major constraints are the requirements of radiation-hard sensors, efficient power distribution, minimum material budget, affordable cost, and fast and reliable production.

This note reports on the design of double-sided silicon strip modules for the short-strip region of the upgraded ATLAS inner tracker. The different components of the module are described. The thermal performance is discussed. The assembly sequence of first module prototypes is explained in detail.

Introduction

The ATLAS detector [1] is a general-purpose experiment designed to fully exploit the physics programme offered by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) accelerator at CERN. The Inner Detector (ID) is the ATLAS inner charged particle tracking detector, providing precise vertex and momentum measurements and particle identification (electron/pion separation) up to \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\). The ID is composed of the Pixel detector, the Semiconductor Tracker (SCT) and the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT). Both the Pixel and SCT are silicon-based detectors, while the TRT is a gaseous straw-tubes detector. A central superconducting solenoid magnet surrounding the TRT provides a 2 T axial-field.

During 2010 the LHC has provided proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, with total integrated and peak instantaneous luminosities for ATLAS of \(\sim\)48 pb\({}^{-1}\) and \(\sim\)\(2\times 10^{32}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\) respectively. Some of the issues that appeared during the initial commissioning phase of detector (related with the ID evaporative cooling system and the off-detector optical links of the Pixel and SCT detectors) were successfully fixed [2]. Since then, the ID has shown excellent tracking performances and stability during the different data-taking periods, with more than 99% of the channels being fully operational [3]. This is certainly the result of many years of R&D and design iterations before the production, the integration, the installation and the commissioning phases were successfully accomplished.

A major luminosity upgrade for the LHC is being considered for \(\sim\)2022. The target is to reach \(\sim 5\times 10^{34}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\) with \(\sim 3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) total integrated luminosity at the end of the LHC lifetime around 2030. Given the fact that the performance of the current ID will be continuously degrading with accumulated radiation damage and ageing, a new ATLAS tracker must be designed and constructed. At the expected luminosities, the huge increase in the particle multiplicities mainly coming from overlapping inelastic proton-proton collisions, will produce higher radiation damage in the detectors with fluences of up to \(\sim 10^{16}\,1-\mathrm{MeV}-\mathrm{n}_{\mathrm{eq}}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}\) for the smallest radii close to the beam-pipe. In addition to radiation hardness, the new tracker design must ensure low detector occupancy to guarantee good tracking capabilities in a extremely dense particle environment (\(\sim\)100-200 pile-up events).

The current baseline layout for the new ATLAS inner tracker is shown in Fig. 1. It is an all-silicon tracking system with an acceptance of \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\), with the innermost region covered by pixel detectors and the intermediate and outer radii by micro-strip detectors. The four pixel barrel layers extend to a radius \(R\sim 20\) cm. The innermost pixel b-layer is integrated with the beam-pipe to be as close as possible to the interaction point. The forward region is covered with six pixel disks up to \(|Z|\sim 131\,\mathrm{cm}\). In addition to the planar detectors that are used in the current ATLAS Pixel detector, more recent extremely radiation tolerant detector technologies (3D-detectors, thin silicon sensors, diamond detectors) are being investigated as valid options to be used for the pixel modules. Five silicon micro-strip layers surround the pixels. The innermost three layers are made of short-strip (SS) sensors (24 mm strip length) that allow low hit occupancy while long-strips (LS) detectors (95 mm strip length) are used for the two outermost layers. Most probably the same readout chip will be used in both cases. Each of the strip end-caps is made of five discs, with detectors arranged in petals. The strip barrel and end-cap layers extend up to \(R\sim 100\) cm and \(Z\sim 280\) cm respectively.

One integration concept for the barrel SS-region is the so-called _stave_ concept [5]. The stave is a \(\sim 1.2\) m long object that has a central core composed of a spacing material (carbon-foam or honeycomb) and carbon fiber facings glued on both sides. A bus cable for the electrical signals is laminated on top of the facings. Single-sided silicon micro-strip detectors are glued on the bus cable and hybrids carrying the front-end electronics are glued on top of the sensitive side of the sensors.

The _super-module_ is another, more conservative, integration concept in which double-sided silicon micro-strip modules are mounted in a local support structure. In this case, a module is considered to be the minimal detecting unit. The heat generated from the front-end electronics is transferred to the cooling pipes located in the lateral sides of a light-weight local support frame. The local support is designed to hold 12 modules enabling a full coverage in both \(\phi\) and \(Z\) for the barrel region. This approach allows the end insertion of the support into the overall barrel structure and has been fully adopted because of its flexibility for integration, commissioning and rework. It is also easy to adapt to possible future design changes, for example longer barrel regions.

Based upon the super-module approach, this paper reports on the design and fabrication of first module prototypes for the upgraded ATLAS tracker. An overview of the module design, the main motivations that lead to pursue such integration concept and the material budget estimates are discussed in section 2. The different module components are described in section 3. Results from finite element analysis thermo-mechanical simulations are shown in section. 4. Several modules have already been constructed in two different assembly sites, the University of Geneva (Switzerland) and KEK (Japan). The list of modules built so-far together with a description of the assembly jigs and of a step-by-step mounting sequence are given in section 5. Finally, a summary is made in section 7. The electrical performance of the modules as described in this note is reported extensively in [6].

## 2 Double-sided silicon micro-strip module design

### Overview

The layout of the double-sided module concept is shown in Fig. 2. It is composed of two \(\sim 10\times 10\) cm\({}^{2}\) n-on-p silicon micro-strip sensors glued to a central Thermo-Pyrolitical-Graphite (TPG) baseboard. The TPG provides mechanical stability and ensures excellent thermal contact for optimum heat dissipation. Two aluminium-nitride (AIN) facing plates are located at each far-end of the baseboard. Four hybrids, two per module side, are bridged on top of the facings using a carbon-carbon sheet underneath the flex circuit so that the hybrids remain electrically and thermally decoupled from the silicon sensors. Precision washers accurately position the module on the support structure. A picture of a fully-assembled module is shown in Fig. 3.

Figure 1: \(RZ\)-view of the _Strawman_ layout for the new ATLAS inner tracker [4].

Figure 2: Double-sided silicon micro-strip module (FPC stands for Flex Printed Circuit; CC stands for carbon-carbon).

The module concept that is being proposed in this paper is largely inspired by the SCT barrel module used in the current ATLAS ID. That design has proven to be a clear success given the excellent performance of the SCT sub-detector during the LHC data-taking [3]. In addition to the experience already acquired with the assembly of a large fraction of the SCT barrel and end-cap modules, the authors think that a modular approach for a very large area silicon detector for the upgraded ATLAS tracker inherently offers clear advantages that can be profitable for the success of such a large-scale project. These can be summarized as:

* Repairaability, replaceability and design evolution. The modules would be assembled individually and directly onto a local support structure containing a cooling circuit. The local structure allows the end insertion of the support into the overall support barrel structure using a rod guiding tool. The end-insertion concept is being adopted because its flexibility for integration, commissioning and rework. Given the fact that the module functionality is decoupled from the support structure, repairaability and replaceability operations are possible up to the last stage of the integration in either the support elements (_e.g._ cooling-loop problems) or individual modules (_e.g._ data communication failures). In those cases where repairs would not be successful, the failure is limited to the loss of a single module. Obviously, during the R&D phase for a future strip tracker, there must be regular evaluations of the performance of the whole system (testbeams, system-tests, etc.). The development and design optimization of major components such as the detector modules, support structures (including cooling) and services (electrical connections to a service bus cable, powering schemes, off-detector connectivity, etc.) can be pursued independently (thus optimizing resources). For example, the evaluation of different cooling options (C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\), CO\({}_{2}\), etc.) has little impact on the design of the local support structure or the silicon module itself.

Figure 3: Picture of a double-sided silicon module.

* Space-points for pattern recognition. Space-points are three-dimensional points created from the intersection between the \(R\phi\) and stereo measurements coming from the two planes of the same double-sided module. In the current ATLAS track reconstruction software _New Tracking_[7], space-points are of great importance since they are used in the pattern recognition stage of the track reconstruction process to seed track candidates before track fitting. The space-point is currently calculated as the intersection between the lines connecting the primary vertex (used as a reference point) and the cluster positions of the \(R\phi\) and stereo measurements. The true space-point coordinates lie in a rhombus-shaped region whose axis depend on the strip-pitch and the stereo angle. One can naively assume that the uncertainty associated with the space-point position decreases with shorter separation distances between measuring planes (around 500 \(\upmu\)m in the case of the double-sided modules). Even if a L0/L1 track-trigger is finally implemented in the upgraded tracker to define _Regions-Of-Interest1_, space-points are thought to still play a key role in order to reduce hit combinatorics when creating track candidates in a very high track density environment. Footnote 1: The current ATLAS trigger has a hardware-based Level 1 system that is used to make an early event selection of objects of interest above programmable thresholds. The so-called _Regions-Of-Interest_ (ROI) include information on the position and transverse momentum of candidate objects (high \(\rm p_{T}\)-muons, \(e\), \(\gamma\), hadrons/\(\tau\), jets) and transverse energy sums. The RoI’s are used to seed further trigger decisions (Level 2).
* Complete hermeticity. The module concept allows to achieve full coverage by maximizing the hermeticity of the strip tracker with detector overlaps in both azimuthal (\(R\phi\)) and longitudinal (along the beam-axis or \(Z\)) directions. The overlaps aim to avoid dead regions which are sources of tracking inefficiencies. The azimuthal overlap is achieved by tilting the modules at a fixed radius, ideally at an angle to compensate for the Lorentz angle that deviates the collected charge within a magnetic field. The longitudinal overlap is obtained by alternating modules at slightly different radii and should be optimized taking also into account the spread in the primary vertex: it is desirable to obtain a uniform projected overlap for particles coming from within \(\sim\)2 \(\sigma_{Z}\) with respect to the nominal interaction point in order to ensure a reasonable \(Z\)-resolution since the \(\sim\)100-200 expected vertices will have the largest separations along the beam-direction. In the case of having full active-edge micro-strip sensors, the modules would be able to be placed edge-to-edge without dead areas. Overlaps are also of particular importance for detector alignment. Both \(R\phi\) and \(Z\)-overlaps are used to correlate adjacent modules and thus allow to constrain their relative positions. The overlap residuals help to improve the quality of the alignment since multiple scattering effects can be safely neglected (the extrapolation radial distance to adjacent modules is small and thus both hits are highly correlated). The current baseline approach for ATLAS is the Global-\(\chi^{2}\) method, a track-based alignment algorithm that minimizes a \(\chi^{2}\) based on track-hit residuals. The alignment is performed at different levels, starting from large structures (Levels 1 and 2) up to individual modules (Level 3). Profiting from the large statistics available during the 2010 proton-proton collisions, the alignment could be performed up to the module level. Due to the large number of degrees of freedom, the local \(\chi^{2}\) algorithm (a method in which the correlations between alignable objects are recovered through iterations) was used at Level 3. Overlap residuals were used to enhance the hit-correlation through the track fit. The precisions achieved for the Pixel and SCT barrel modules are 4 and 10 \(\upmu\)m respectively [8].

* Distributed mass-production and quality assurance. The upgraded tracker would require \(\mathcal{O}(10^{4})\) silicon modules. The production of such a large number of modules will need to be shared among all the collaborating institutes spread around the world. Based on the experience of the macro-assembly of the ID, the integration of the modules into the final support structures is likely to be made at one or two institutes, or even at CERN. It seems reasonable to assume that during the module production phase an easier and more cost-effective parallelization of tasks (assembly, metrology, electrical tests, etc.) would be achievable with objects of reasonable size (\(\sim\)\(12\times 12\) cm\({}^{2}\)). This especially applies to the extensive tests expected within the quality assurance programme (_e.g._ thermal cycling) needed to ensure that the modules fulfil the required specifications (still to be defined formally).
* Testeability In addition to a design extensively validated in terms of mechanical, thermal and electrical performance, the prototype modules need to be evaluated under realistic conditions (real particles in a testbeam environment, irradiation to the expected fluences, etc.) as well as their integration with the support structures (system-test to study sensitivity to noise pickup, different grounding configurations, interplay with the cooling circuit, etc.). Special emphasis should be put in the tracking capabilities, ensuring that the required signal-to-noise performance is achieved with high track reconstruction efficiency. Once more, relatively small and modular detecting units seem to be more appropriate to perform these kind of mandatory tests.

### Material budget

The estimated material budget for the double-sided module ("as-built" first module prototypes) is summarized in Table 1 and Figs. 4 and 5. The numbers shown in the pie-charts are in percent of radiation length X\({}_{0}\) and they have been normalized to the area of the barrel sensor (9514.0516 mm\({}^{2}\)). The reader may refer to appendix C for additional details.

The total radiation-length of the module is 2.44% X\({}_{0}\), being the total estimated weight of 58.7 g. For a hybrid fully populated (including SMD components and ASICs), the calculated radiation length is 0.326% X\({}_{0}\) with a total estimated weight of 7.073 g. A stuffed-hybrid with SMD components but without readout ASICs is estimated to weight 5.92 g. The measured weight is 5.96 g, being the discrepancy with respect to the calculations of less than 1%. Table 2 shows the measured weights of four completed modules. The difference with respect to the estimated weight is around 7% for the first three modules, where no accurate control of the glue dispensing was applied during the assembly. In module GMX-2008, a dedicated mask pattern was used for dispensing the glue over the TPG (see sec. 5.3). The measured weight is closer to the estimations, but it is still 3% higher. This difference is thought to be due to an underestimate of the thickness of the (parylene+TPG+parylene) set, assumed to be (20+600+20) = 640 um in this case.

The two micro-strip sensors and the 80 front-end ASICs (ABCN-25) of the double-sided module represent respectively 28% and 7% out of the total module material budget. The four stuffed hybrids, each including passive components and the carbon-carbon (CC) bridge, correspond to 1.041% X\({}_{0}\), which is almost 43% of the total of the module. The TPG baseboard and the facings represent respectively 13% and 5% of the total material budget. There is clearly a large room for improvement in what concerns the sensors, hybrid, baseboard and facings. Fig. 5 shows a chart of the estimated material budget for the current KEK hybrid. The major parts contributing to the material budget in this case are the main flex-circuit (35%), the CC-substrate (22%), the readout ASICs (20%), the SMD passive components (14%) and the Samtec connector (5%).

## 3 Module components

A complete double-sided strip module has been shown in Fig. 3. Its major components, the silicon sensors, the readout ASICs, the hybrids, the baseboard and facings, are described in the following sections.

### Silicon sensors

The ATLAS07 detectors [9] are novel radiation tolerant silicon micro-strip sensors with \(n\)-type readout strips in a \(p\)-type bulk developed by the ATLAS R&D group _"Development of \(n\)-\(in\)-\(p\) silicon sensors for very high radiation environment"_[10] and manufactured in 6-inch (150 mm diameter) wafers by Hamamatsu Photonics [11]. These large area n-on-p detectors have the benefits of not suffering type-inversion after irradiation (the sensors would still be operative even if biased under full-depletion voltage) and of being single-sided (significantly lower cost if compared with double-side processing).

The layout of the mask of the ATLAS07 detector is shown in Fig. 6. The large area sensor has a size of \(97.54\times 97.54\) mm\({}^{2}\) and a thickness of 320 \(\upmu\)m. The distance from the sensitive region to the physical cut edge is 980 \(\upmu\)m. The detector comprises four segments, two with _axial_ strips parallel to the

Figure 6: Mask layout of the ATLAS07 sensor. The main sensor (largest area in the mask) is divided into four segments. The top and second from top segments have axial strips; the bottom and second from bottom segments have stereo strips. The 6-inch wafer also contains 24 miniature sensors (P1 to P24) with different isolation structures each (p-stop, p-spray, etc.). The miniature sensors (100 mm\({}^{2}\) total area, 104 axial readout strips with a strip pitch of 74.5 \(\upmu\)m) are used for pre and post-irradiation performance studies.

sensor edges and two with _stereo_ strips inclined by an angle of 40 mrad. The average strip length and pitch is 2.38 cm and 74.5 \(\upmu\)m respectively. There is a total of 1280 read-out strips per segment. The bulk substrate is float zone (FZ) p-type with a crystal orientation \(\langle 1\ 0\ 0\rangle\). The n\({}^{+}\) implants are 16 \(\upmu\)m wide, with a maximum resistivity of 200 \(\mathrm{k}\Omega\cdot\mathrm{cm}\). The implants are biased through polysilicon resistors and AC-coupled to 22 \(\upmu\)m wide aluminium readout strips that are electrically isolated by a common p-stop trace.

Extensive tests are being been performed by the ATLAS R&D collaboration to study the characteristics of the sensor prototypes in terms of bulk and strip characteristics before and after irradiation. The sensors are found to fulfil all the electrical pre-irradiation specifications, specially in terms of full depletion voltage and leakage current2[12]. The sensors are safely operated up to a maximum bias voltage of 1000 V. The performance of the detectors irradiated to the fluences expected for the SS-region (around \(10^{15}\) 1-MeV-neutrons/cm\({}^{2}\)) is evaluated in terms of surface and bulk damage, charge collection and signal-to-noise ratio with very good results so far [13, 14].

Footnote 2: For non-irradiated ATLAS07 sensors, the full-depletion voltage is required to be less than 500 V and the leakage current must not exceed 20 mA at 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

### Readout ASIC

The Atlas Binary Chip Next (ABCN) is a custom front-end ASIC that has been designed to evaluate the read-out and electrical performance of strip module prototypes for the ATLAS tracker upgrade. The current version has been produced by IBM in the 0.25 \(\upmu\)m technology (hence the chip will be referred hereafter as ABCN-25). A new chip (ABCN-13) to be fabricated in 0.13 \(\upmu\)m is currently under design. The chip handles 128 read-out channels with a binary architecture and it is conceptually very similar to the ABCD3TA chips used in the current ATLAS SCT [15]. The simplified block-diagram of the ABCN-25 chip is shown in Fig. 7. The per-channel analogue stage comprises pre-amplification, shaping and differential discrimination. The front-end has been optimized for short strips (input capacitances of 5 pF) and it accepts both input signal polarities (compatibility with both p and n-type strips). The binary data at the discriminator output is latched at every clock cycle to the input register and then buffered in a 256-cell

Figure 7: ABCN-25 ASIC block diagram.

(6.4 \(\upmu\)s) pipeline. Upon the reception of a L1 trigger, the data corresponding to three bunch-crossings is transferred to a second-level derandomizer buffer with 128 bits depth (43 events). Data is then transferred to the readout buffer and compressed according to a given selection criteria. The specifications of the ABCN-25 ASIC can be found in [16].

The configuration of the different chip parameters is made by means of several registers (see table 3). The registers are controlled by the command decoder, which is in charge of interpreting the commands and the control data sent to the chip. The command decoder sends the relevant decoded information to the appropriate functional block for further actions. Most of the serial access registers are of type _cached_, holding Single Event Upset (SEU) information. All cached-type registers allow write/read access. The chip configuration and status (including SEU bits) can be read through a couple of serial read-only Status registers. A 128-bit Mask register is used to disable bad or noisy channels to avoid an increased data rate due to false hits. A chip is uniquely identified by a 16-bit Fuse register (set at the foundry). The ABCN-25 has been designed for a maximum data readout speed of 160 Mbits/s to avoid deadtime. Multiplexing the data of several modules into a single optical link can easily increase the rate to the order of several Gbits/s (with current technologies).

The chips are grouped together in a token chain. There are two possible read-out modes: _standalone_ and _module controller_ mode.

* In standalone mode (see Fig. 8), the first chip of the chain is configured as "Master", the last chip as "End" and the rest as "Slave". When the Master chip receives a L1 trigger (and if its readout buffer contains data), the readout sequence starts immediately. The Master sends a _preamble_ bit sequence, its own data and a token signal to the adjacent Slave chip. The latter sends its own data and then delivers the token to the next chip. The data-readout plus token-passing mechanism is repeated from chip to chip up to the one declared as End which issues a specfic _trailer_ bit pattern to indicate the end of the readout sequence.

\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l} \hline
**Register** & **Length** & **Type** & **Read** & **Write** & **Purpose** \\ \hline Configuration 1 & 16 & Cached & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & Configuration \\ Configuration 2 & 16 & Cached & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & Configuration \\ Threshold & 16 & Cached & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & Discriminator threshold setting \\ Bias 1 & 16 & Cached & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & Preamplifier currents \\ Bias 2 & 16 & Cached & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & Shaper currents \\ Bias 3 & 16 & Cached & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & Differential and comparator currents \\ L1 Delay & 16 & Cached & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & L1 trigger latency information \\ Status 1 & 16 & Read-only & \(\surd\) & - & Status and configuration information \\ Status 2 & 16 & Read-only & \(\surd\) & - & Status and configuration information \\ Fuse & 16 & Read-only & \(\surd\) & - & Unique chip identifier \\ CalDelay & 16 & Serial & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & Amplitude and delay of the calibration pulse \\ Trim DAC & 16 & Serial & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & Individual channel threshold correction \\ Mask & 128 & Serial & - & \(\surd\) & Disable bad/noisy channels \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* In module controller mode there is no Master chip, all the chips but the End are configured as Slave. A local Module Controller Chip starts the token-passing mechanism and at the end it gathers the data from all the chips in the chain.

For the future ATLAS inner tracker it is foreseen an increase in the number of electronic readout channels by a factor of \(\sim\)10. Individual power for each module is simply not affordable due to the number of cables needed, and therefore new powering distribution solutions are required. Two different powering schemes are currently being developed: serial powering and parallel powering using DC-DC voltage converters. In the serial powering scheme, several modules are supplied with a common current source and the required voltage levels are provided by shunt and voltage regulators. In the parallel DC-DC scheme, a unique high input voltage line supplies the modules, and the operating low voltage is obtained typically through an inductor-based buck converter with high conversion ratios and high efficiency [17]. The ABCN-25 chip implements a new power management block with two prototypes of distributed shunt regulator circuits for the serial powering scheme, and a low drop voltage regulator to supply the analog front-end voltage from the digital input. The nominal consumption of the analogue front-end is 0.7 mW per channel. The digital supply current typically is \(\sim\)90 mA at 2.5 V3 (40 MHz).

Footnote 3: \(\sim\) 1 V for ABCN-13

Each channel of the front-end has an internal calibration circuit that can be used to inject a test charge into the analogue chain. Upon reception of a specific command, the voltage pulse is generated by a chopper circuit and injected into the channel through a calibration capacitor. The test charge can be injected in one of the four available calibration input lines, thus every four channel in the chip are tested simultaneously. Measurements of the basic analogue front-end parameters have been performed by mounting ABCN-25 chips on different test board PCBs and prototype hybrids (see section 3.3). Fig. 9 shows a PCB developed to test single ABCN-25 ASICs. Two different data-acquisition systems have been successfully used. One is based on the SCTDAQ test-system (custom VME hardware and ROOT

based software used to test SCT modules) with extended functionalities to deal with the ABCN protocol. The other one, called ABCNIDAQ, is based on a commercial PXI/PCI high-speed digital input/output card from National Instruments and custom LabVIEW-based software (see [6] for further details). Fig. 10 shows the measured gain and noise at the differential discriminator input for a single ABCN-25 chip. These measurements are based on threshold scans (the discriminator threshold is varied) performed for different charge amplitudes. The input noise is \(\sim\)400 equivalent noise charge (ENC) and the gain is in perfect agreement with the designed value of 100 mV/fC.

Figure 10: Gain (left) and input noise (right) of the ABCN-25 ASIC. In each case, the statistics box shows the result of a Gaussian fit to the distribution.

Figure 9: Single chip test PCB [18].

The front-end noise has been measured as a function of the input capacitance. External SMD capacitors were added to two different channels of a single ABCN-25 chip mounted on a test PCB and the input noise was measured. The capacitance of the setup has been estimated to be around 0.8 pF (stray capacitances in the PCB). The external capacitors were varied up to 15.6 fC. Fig. 11 shows the average noise values for the two channels loaded with the extra capacitances and for the measurements performed at two different sites. Three different input transistor currents were used (minimum, nominal and maximal values: 81, 140 and 198 \(\upmu\)A respectively). There is a very good agreement between the measurements and an analytical EKV model tuned for the 0.25 \(\upmu\)m CMOS technology in which the ABCN-25 chip has been produced [19]. Since the strip capacitances for short and long strips are expected to be around 2.5 and 10 pF respectively, the ABCN ASIC can be even used for long-strip silicon modules with acceptable noise figures by increasing the input transistor current. For the short-strip region, the measured noise is around 600 ENC.

### Hybrids

A four-layer copper-polyimide (Cu/PI) flexible circuit hybrid has been designed by KEK and produced by Taiyo Industrial Co. [20]. The hybrid layout is shown in Fig. 12 and a schematic cross-section along the hybrid length is depicted in Fig. 13.

The size of the flex-circuit is \(136\times 28\) cm\({}^{2}\). The first two layers, L1 and L2, carry the main circuit patterns for the front-end chips including redundancy lines, while layer L3 and L4 are used for power distribution and grounding respectively. All Cu/PI sheets are made with adhesive-less technology, being the thickness of the polyimide and copper sheet being 25 and 12 \(\upmu\)m respectively. Electrical connections among different layers are realized by either through-holes, penetrating all layers, or laser-cut via-holes between two adjacent layers. The usage of the button plating technology (plating in a limited area around

the holes instead of having a whole plated surface) allowed to reduce by \(\sim 40\%\) the weight of the bare flexible circuit with respect to the standard panel plating technique, achieving a final weight for the hybrid of 1.90 g. Fig. 14 shows the design rules adopted for the various interconnect elements within the hybrid and a close view of the trace layout between chips.

Figure 12: Layout of the KEK hybrid. The four circuit layers are labelled L1 (top) to L4 (bottom).

Figure 13: Schematic cross-section of the KEK hybrid along its length.

A 400 um thick and 112 mm wide carbon-carbon (CC) sheet made of uni-directional fibres is glued underneath the flex circuit to bridge the hybrid over the silicon sensor avoiding any interference with the detector surface. Fig.15 shows pictures of the bare flex circuit top and bottom sides, and after including the CC-sheet on the bottom side. The main functions of the CC bridge is to provide to the hybrid mechanical rigidity and to improve its thermal performance. Seventeen thermal through-holes are added underneath the analogue part of each ASIC. These vertical copper holes are filled with thermally and electrically conducting glue. This ensures thermal and electrical connections between each chip and the CC bridge. The effective thermal conductivity of these pillars is \(\sim 40\)\(\mathrm{W/m\,K}\). The large thermal conductivity of \(\sim 670\)\(\mathrm{W/m\,K}\) of the CC-sheet allows the efficient transfer of the heat generated by the readout chips to the heat sink located at the bridge legs. At the last stage of hybrid assembly, a 0.8 mm pitch miniature connector is mounted at one end of the circuit layers to route the LVDS signals towards the data acquisition system. The total weight of the hybrid, including flex-circuit layers and CC-bridge but excluding electrical components (connector, SMDs, ASICs) is 5.03 g, corresponding to 0.002 X\({}_{0}\) equivalent radiation lengths (normalized to the sensor area).

### Baseboard and facings

The baseboard acts as the thermo-mechanical core of the double-sided module. Its design must ensure an optimal heat path allowing an efficient flow from the parts acting as heat sources (front-end chips through the hybrid bridge feet, silicon sensors) to the ceramic facings that will be in contact with the cooling block via thermal grease. The materials to be used should therefore have a high thermal conductivity to help in the power dissipation, in addition to a low coefficient of thermal expansion and a low mass. The Thermal Pyrolytic Graphite (TPG) is a pyrolitic carbon-based anisotropic material with a high in-plane thermal conductivity of \(\sim 1800\)\(\mathrm{W/m\cdot K}\) and low radiation length. The TPG baseboard is used in direct contact to the silicon sensors. It is sandwiched between four aluminium-nitride (AlN) ceramic pieces which have a relatively high thermal conductivity \(\sim 180\)\(\mathrm{W/m\cdot K}\) for an electrical insulating ceramic. Furthermore, the use of the AlN facings increases the module stiffness that is reinforced later-on once the two silicon sensors are glued to the baseboard during the assembly process of the module. As seen in Fig. 16, the baseboard is designed with six holes that are intended for the kinematic precision mounting of the module to the support structure and for pressing the module on the cooling blocks. Before the

assembly of the baseboard, the TPG is sent to a company for a thin film Parylene coating of 10 to 20 \(\upmu\)m which allows a complete electric insulation with respect to the HV sensor backplane.

Thermo-mechanical performance

The harsh radiation environment expected in the upgraded LHC scenario increases the radiation damage on both the silicon sensors and the FE electronics as a function of the integrated fluence. The defects induced by radiation in the silicon bulk originate a linear increase of the leakage current with the fluence \(\Delta I=\alpha\cdot V\cdot\Phi\), where \(\alpha\) is the damage constant factor [21] for a fluence \(\Phi\) inside a volume \(V\). A higher leakage current produces a higher power dissipation in the detectors, an increase of the shot noise and of the integration time of the signal by the electronics. A higher current also increases the power consumption, leading to a higher heat load of the detectors. Since the dependence of the leakage current \(I_{\text{leak}}\) with the temperature \(T\) is exponential,

\[I_{\text{leak}}\propto T^{2}\exp\left(-\frac{E_{g}}{2k_{b}T}\right)\]

where \(E_{g}\) is the effective gap energy and \(k_{b}\) is the Boltzmann constant, an efficient cooling must be provided to prevent the thermal-runaway, a non-recoverable catastrophic thermal behaviour. The module design must ensure that the maximum heat load is dissipated keeping the module safe against the thermal runaway. The detectors need to be maintained at a uniform low temperature to reduce the reverse annealing and to compensate for the increase of leakage current with fluence.

In addition to radiation hardness, the main mechanical requirements for the tracker are the precision, the stiffness, the stability and the low material budget. Such achievements can be only based on an optimized design with the best material choice (within acceptable cost) taking into account that the detector will operate at several tens degrees below the assembly temperature. Thermal and thermo-mechanical studies based on Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations are essential to optimize the module design. The maximum temperature before runaway must be estimated for the expected fluences to ease the selection of basic components (coolant, thermal grease, etc.). The correct choice of materials for the module itself is essential to anticipate the thermo-mechanical behaviour at the operating cooling temperatures.

### Module design and material properties used in the FEA simulations

The thermal management on the module is mainly dependent on the module design, the material selection and the dissipated power. The three-dimensional FEA calculations have been made from a module design implemented in CATIA [22] and then imported into ABAQUS [23]. In the simulated geometry, the two far-end cooling plates and the module itself form a unique structure with a carbon-carbon cover embedding the cooling pipe (see Fig. 17). The module remains a symmetric object, with the cooling circuits running on the two sides along the strip direction aiming to provide a uniform temperature across the silicon detector. A thermal grease compound provides the thermal path between the pipes (with sliding joins) and the cooling plates. The glue (both electrically and thermally conductives) and grease interfaces have been also taken into account. The meshing is based on solid elements using a linear formulation.

Each material has its own thermo-mechanical properties and the main three parameters (in addition to the geometry) that account for the behaviour of an item exposed to temperature changes are:

* the Thermal Conductivity
* the Coefficient of Thermal Expansion Coefficient (CTE)
* the Young Modulus (or elasticity modulus)

In absolute, when considering temperature variations in a given material, the lower its CTE the better. However, more important is the relative difference of CTE between all assembly parts that will build up the internal stresses. The mesh used for the FEA calculations has been optimized in terms of the number of nodes to have reasonable CPU processing times. No big discrepancies have been observed in the stresses due to CTE mismatches between materials (below 20% difference between quadratic and linear elements). Tables 4 and 5 list the thermal and mechanical properties of both isotropic and anisotropic materials used in the simulation.

Table 6 shows the different load-cases that have been simulated. The power load applied (cases 1, 2 and 4) is 0.3 W per chip (24 W per module). A coolant temperature of -30 \({}^{\circ}\)C with a Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) of 4000 W/m\({}^{2}\) K [24] and an inner pipe diameter of 4.0 mm have been used (other coolants are discussed in section 4.2). The HTC has been implemented as a film exchange coefficient that depends upon the fluid type, the vapour quality inside the pipe and the mass flow [25]. Radiation effects have not been included but their contribution is expected to be small.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:23]

Two types of evaporative cooling systems have been compared:

* \(\mathrm{C_{3}F_{8}}\) (as used in the current ATLAS Pixel and SCT sub-systems) assuming a HTC of 4000 \(\mathrm{W/m^{2}\,K}\)[24] and an inner pipe diameter of 4.0 mm.
* \(\mathrm{CO_{2}}\) assuming a HTC of 8000 \(\mathrm{W/m^{2}\,K}\)[26] and an inner pipe diameter of 1.8 mm.

In both cases, a coolant temperature of -30 \({}^{\circ}\)C has been set. The simulation results show a similar thermal performance for the two types of coolants. That is explained by the fact that the reduction of the HTC in \(\mathrm{C_{3}F_{8}}\) with respect to \(\mathrm{CO_{2}}\) is compensated by an increase of the pipe exchange surface. The advantages of \(\mathrm{CO_{2}}\) are clear, as it provides a reduced material budget and a higher safety margin provided by the minimum temperature that can be achieved4.

Footnote 4: Even if -30 \({}^{\circ}\)C has been taken in the FEA, an evaporation temperature of -35 \({}^{\circ}\)C can be reached with a \(\mathrm{CO_{2}}\)-based cooling system.

Figure 19: Temperature distribution across the module (top) and across the silicon sensors (bottom) for load-case 1 (see table 6). In the case of the module, the temperatures range between -30 and -13.5 \({}^{\circ}\)C; for the sensors, the range is from -24 to -23 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

Additional FEA calculations could be performed by easily changing the material thicknesses and conductivities and the boundary conditions, therefore allowing an optimization of the design by evaluating the effect of a given parameter in the thermal performance. For example, the grease layer compound, which has to be qualified in terms of thermal conductivity, radiation hardness and assembly practicality, is a key material since it allows a modular assembly with reduced stress between the cooling pipe, the local support and the module. Depending on the provider and on the loaded compound, the thermal grease conductivities range from 0.5 to 2.0 W/mK. Based on the FEA simulations and the dependence of the leakage current with the temperature, thermal runaway curves can be extracted. Fig. 20 shows the maximum silicon temperature as a function of the silicon power density normalized at 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Three different values of thermal grease conductivity, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 W/mK, have been considered. The power density expected for a maximum fluence of \(1.5\times 10^{15}\)\(1-\mathrm{MeV}-\mathrm{n_{eq}/cm^{2}}\) at 30 cm from the interaction point is 1 mW/mm\({}^{2}\). This module design is shown to have a safety margin of at least a factor of two to the runaway point for the large range of thermal conductivities simulated (thermal grease layers of 70 \(\upmu\)m thickness).

Detailed studies have been also performed using different thermal grease compounds [27]. A dedicated setup was used to determine the thermal conductivity of samples before and after irradiation with a measurement error of the calibrated temperature sensors of 0.1 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Known fluids (water, glycerol, silicon oil) were used as control samples to assess systematic uncertainties. The thermal conductivities obtained were found to be compatible with datasheet values within a 5% error. A very good agreement was found with the FEA calculations after inclusion of convection and radiation effects into the simulation (convection coefficient of 5 W/mK). It was found that the thermal conductivity of the samples tested were not significantly affected by fluences up to \(1.0\times 10^{15}\)\(1-\mathrm{MeV}-\mathrm{n_{eq}/cm^{2}}\). The silicon-based DC340 compound [28] suffered polymerization, and therefore silicon-based compounds should be discarded when sliding grease joints are required.

Figure 20: Thermal runaway curves computed for three different values of thermal grease conductivity.

### Thermo-mechanical FEA simulations

When a module is at room temperature (assembly and machining temperature), the internal stresses between the different materials should be low or even null. The correct choice of the materials and the conceptual design itself, are essential to anticipate the thermo-mechanical behaviour when operating at temperatures of the order of -35 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Internal stresses are distributed to all mechanically joined parts. The final figures of merit are the mechanical displacements and the maximum stress that the material can stand with its mechanical properties not being affected. For example, a stress that leads to plastic deformation (yield point) of a solid is prohibited. If in addition the temperature cycles are occurring many times during the life-time of an item, the fatigue will end-up damaging the whole assembly.

Bonded joints provide a more uniform stress distribution than other methods of joining which rely on single joint contacts, such as bolting, riveting and spot welding, where high stress concentrations occur. Polymeric adhesive or glue joins are therefore often used in the assembly for modules and other structural parts. But the static and fatigue properties of polymeric adhesives can be influenced by environmental conditions such as temperature, moisture, chemical agents and radiation environments. For the double sided strip module, the glue joints are located at different interfaces, for example between the sensor and the TPG baseboards and between the hybrid bridge feet and the AlN facing. The complete double sided module will have kinematic mounting bolt screws. One screw allows a precise location for the origin of the module and another one for the alignment while the remaining two will allow a free displacement in the plane (see Fig. 21).

The local support structure on which the 12 double sided modules are mounted is made of composite material with low CTE. Each local support will then be mounted on a barrel structure of the same kind of material, which means almost no induced thermo-mechanical stresses. Therefore, the only significant thermo-mechanical stresses that can be anticipated with the FEA simulations are on the module itself.

Figure 21: Meshing of the module with its four mounting points, where 2 are kinematic mount bolts.

The thermo-mechanical simulation uses a special "interaction" to connect the different components (_e.g._ the connection between the glue and the TPG or the silicon wafer), where not only the temperature is transferred from one node to the next, but also the three translational degrees of freedom when fixing mechanically the components. Figs. 22 and 23 show respectively the displacements and the internal stress distribution on the full module. In the former case, the displacements have been magnified by a factor of 200 for illustrative purposes. The pictures reflect the high quality of the model, with all components being connected by dedicated nodes/meshes.

In this analysis, the Von Mises (VM) yield criterion is used. The VM stress is a scalar value computed from the 3\(\times\)3 stress tensor5 that allows to predict the Yield strength of the stressed material (elastic limit). Fig. 24 shows the distribution of VM stresses for a particular load-case (values have been averaged per mesh to avoid edge effects). The maximum stress is about 14 N/mm\({}^{2}\), which is quite acceptable as yield-point for the silicon. Some refining of the meshes have been performed but no significant variations in terms of VM stress distributions have been observed.

Footnote 5: The stress tensor is a symmetric tensor with six degrees of freedom (3 normal stresses and 3 shear stresses), that is used to specify the stress at any point of the object

Figs. 25 and 26 show respectively the related three-dimensional deflection and the sagging effect or bowing (out of plane deflection along the Z-axis) of the silicon sensors. The maximum deflection (opposite corner) is of the order of 12 \(\upmu\)m and the maximum sagging deformation is \(\sim\)3 \(\upmu\)m.

One of the most critical regions in terms of mechanical stress is located on the TPG baseboard.

Figure 22: Mapping of the overall displacement (load-case 1, see table 6). For clarity, the deformation scale factor has been set to 200.

Fig. 27 shows the stress mapping at the interface between the silicon and the TPG (the parylene cover layer has been neglected in terms of thermo-mechanical analysis). The results show a relatively good safety margin (factor of 2) against the TPG yield point (\(\sim\)40 N/mm\({}^{2}\)), with stresses in the most relevant region (edge) of the order of 20 N/mm\({}^{2}\).

Table 8 summarizes the results obtained with the thermo-mechanical FEA simulations in terms of maximum Von Mises stress for the sensor and TPG, and the maximum bowing in the detector. As expected, the convection has almost no impact in the stress analysis. The VM values obtained give good safety margins with respect to the yield strength of silicon (\(\sim\)150 N/mm\({}^{2}\)) and TPG (\(\sim\)40 N/mm\({}^{2}\)). The maximum out-of-plane displacements are of the order of 3 \(\upmu\)m.

## 5 Module prototypes

Following the module design explained in section 2 and using the components described in section 3, both the University and Geneva and KEK have built a number of double-sided module prototypes (see tables 9 and 10). The modules are categorized depending on the version of the KEK hybrid (version 1/2 for GMX/KMX-100x/200x modules). All modules used so far float-zone 1 (FZ1) sensors with or without p-stop. Module KMX-2003 was the first being produced in industry, and hence hybrids with some dead chips known beforehand were used for the assembly in any case. The electrical performance of these modules is reported extensively in [6].

### Problems and lessons learned from the first module GMX/KMX-1000

The first module prototypes built at each site (GMX/KMX-1000) were mainly intended to exercise the assembly procedures, to spot problems in the production of some of the components and to determine possible weaknesses in the module design. They provided an invaluable experience in terms of the identification and understanding of fundamental issues inherently bounded to both a first hybrid batch production and to a first module assembly. Important lessons were learned and solutions to the problems found were adopted for subsequent assemblies. The main problems found and how they were corrected (if applicable) are described below.

* _Metallization problems._ In some cases, a poor metallization was found in some bonding-pads of the hybrid (see Fig. 28), making the wire-bonding operations difficult. An improved metallization process and stricter quality assurance tests were requested to the flex-circuit manufacturer company. No more problems of this kind have been detected (as of today) in subsequent hybrid batches.
* _Wire-bonding overlap._ In the first version of the KEK hybrid, a specific pad layout was at the origin of a wire-bonding overlap in the data-token lines (between chips) and in some ground bonds (from chip to hybrid), increasing the probabilities of shorts due to touching cross-bonds. The bonding pad layout was modified in the second hybrid version, solving the overlap problems (see Fig. 29).

* _Adhesives excess._ When gluing the aluminium-nitride facings to the baseboard there was an overflow of adhesive into the facings vacuum chucks due to an excess amount of glue. The glue pattern under the facings was modified to avoid such problem.

* _High-voltage back-plane contact._ The tongue used for the sensor high-voltage bias was not really integrated into the original module design. Due to time constraints, the first HV-tongue was manually machined and this was at the origin of some difficulties while positioning it with a specific alignment jig. Furthermore, the electrical contact to the detector back-plane was made non-optimally with a conductive epoxy, and this was suspected to be the cause of very low currents (below 40 nA) while being monitored at low temperature. In the following modules, the HV-tongue was precisely shaped with an automatic machining process, with a main kapton-core and copper-nickel-gold (CuNiAu) sheets on its both ends. The electrical connection to the sensor back-plane was improved by using four wire-bonds.
* _High-voltage breakdown._ While measuring the IV-characteristics of the sensor of the GMX-1000 module at room temperature, high-voltage discharges were observed at around 300 V. No breakdowns appeared while re-measuring with nitrogen flushed inside the test-box containing the micro-probe needles. The low breakdown voltage was due to an intermediate floating pin between the HV and HV-GND pins in the miniature Samtec 0.8 mm pitch connector located at the far-end of the flex-circuit pigtail (see Fig. 30). Since the pin diameter is 0.3 mm, two consecutive pins are separated by 0.5 mm in a bare connector, and down to \(\sim\) 0.3 mm if considering the soldering joints. Since the dielectric strength of humid air is \(\sim\) 1 kV/mm, the presence of the extra floating pin close to the HV-pin would explain the breakdown observed. That pin was of course removed while assembling the following hybrid connectors, to increase the distance of the HV-pin to the next pin. No further low-voltage breakdowns have been observed, even without dry air.

### Assembly jigs

A set of jigs has been developed to assemble the silicon module prototypes as presented in this note. Since tight mechanical tolerances were not a major requirement for these prototypes but proving the double-sided module concept in terms mainly of electrical performance, the jigs have been produced following a design that is simple and low cost cost. The different jigs used for the module assembly are shown in Figs. 31-34 and described below.

* The _baseboard assembly plate_ (Fig. 31) consists of an aluminium plate with two linear vacuum grooves, four alignment plungers and four guiding pins. The plate is used to position and glue one side of the TPG baseboard to two AlN facings. Two additional identical vacuum chucks will put in place the two remaining facings on top of the baseboard.
* The _detectors' vacuum chucks_ (Fig. 32a and b) are used to hold with vacuum the sensors while assembling them to the TPG baseboard. Each chuck consists in a teflon plate bolted on top of an aluminium plate. In both cases, a squared vacuum groove is centered in the teflon plate, and three alignment pins are used to place the detector with respect to its cutting edges. Six holes, three on each side with respect to chuck center, are used to hold plungers to align the baseboard and facings to the sensor. One of the chucks (Fig. 32a) has two additional vacuum channels to fix the facings while assembling one of the module sides. Lastly, two alignment pins are used to place one chuck on top of the other while sandwiching the set of silicon detectors, facings and baseboard. A different chuck is used to assemble the high-voltage tongue to each sensor (Fig. 32c).
* The hybrids are positioned with a special _placement jig_ (Fig. 33a) which is longitudinally aligned with the sensor central axis. Once a first module side has been completed, it is transferred to the _hybrids assembly plate_ (Fig. 33b), an aluminium plate with two large symmetric apertures that provide the required space for the front-end electronics. The _hybrids pressing jigs_ (Fig. 33c) are used to press the hybrids against the facings while glue-curing.
* After assembly, the module is stored in a _multi-purpose holding box_ (Fig. 34). The box is also used as bonding jig, and thus it remains a very convenient container to store and transport the module before, during and after bonding operations.

The circle indicates a floating pin between the HV and the HV-GND pins that was not removed while assembling the hybrid. The presence of that conducting pin is suspected to be at the origin of very low (300 V) voltage breakdowns observed in the GMX-1000 module. See text for further details.

### Assembly procedure

The different stages of the assembly sequence are described below.

1. Baseboard and facings assembly A rectangular teflon piece with a single linear vacuum channel is fixed on top of each far-end of the baseboard assembly plate (Fig. 35a). The four alignment pins located in the corners of the baseplate are used to drive auxiliary jigs at different stages of the module assembly. Two AlN facings are positioned to the plungers over the teflon pieces and vacuum is applied to avoid displacements. Glue (Araldite 2011) is dispensed to the facings. The TPG baseboard is laid on top of the facings by means of the four guiding pins (Fig. 35b). Two other AlN facings are held with vacuum on two independent vacuum chucks (Fig. 35c). Each chuck contains the same teflon structure as in the baseboard assembly plate so that all four module facings are identical. The vacuum chucks are inserted into the alignment pins of the base-plate (Fig. 35d). Vacuum is applied to press the facings to the baseboard (curing time is typically 24 hours).

Figure 35: Baseboard and AlN facings assembly sequence.

2. Assembly of high-voltage tongue to sensors A silicon detector is placed (back-plane facing up) on a detector vacuum chuck by aligning two of the sensor edges to three alignment pins. Vacuum is applied to hold the detector and the high-voltage tongue assembly jig is inserted into the chuck by means of two guiding pins (Fig. 36a). The _s-shaped_ tongue is positioned (Fig. 36b) and glued with Araldite-2011 (electrically non-conductive). After removal of the assembly jig, the electrical connection to the sensor back-plane is made with four low-height wire-bonds (Fig. 36d).
3. Detector assembly Fig. 37a shows a sensor already glued to one side of the TPG baseboard. The assembly of the other side follows exactly the same procedure. A 100 \(\upmu\)m-thick mask with a glue distribution pattern is placed over the baseboard between the facings and fixed with kapton tapes before spreading the glue. The mask pattern is shown in Fig. 38. The pattern provides a good glue coverage for most of the sensor area while avoiding the edges and ensures the required fixation of the sensor (and in particular under the bond-pads) that avoids difficulties during wire-bonding operations. The glue mask has been used for all modules assembled in KEK and for the last module built by the University of Geneva, GMX-2008. The remaining six modules assembled in Geneva were fabricated without the mask and therefore without an accurate control of the total glue dispensed.

Figure 37: Detectors to baseboard assembly.

Fig.37c shows the glue after being applied to the pattern. The second detector, with the HV-tongue already bonded to the back-plane, is transferred to the baseboard (Fig. 37e) and pressed against it. After curing during 24 hours at room temperature, the set is ready (Fig. 37f) and IV-characteristics are measured for both sensors.
4.- Hybrid assembly The complete set of baseboard and sensors is transferred to the hybrid assembly plate (see Fig. 33b). The T-shaped hybrid placement jig is positioned on top of one sensor by means of two guiding pins (Fig. 39a). Glue is dispensed to the the carbon-carbon feet of the bridge the main flex sits on and two hybrids are aligned with respect to their edges to the placement jig (Fig. 39b and 39c). The hybrid pressing jigs are put in place so that to press both ends of the hybrids to the facings (Figs. 39d and 39e). After glue curing, the set is turned upside-down (see the grooves in the assembly plate Fig. 33b that provide the required space for the already glued hybrids) and the other two remaining hybrids are assembled the same way (Figs. 39f).
5.- Wire-bonding The module is transfered to the _multi-purpose holding box_ for bonding. The chip-to-hybrid and the chip-to-sensor wire-bonds are made using with standard 25 \(\upmu\)m Al-Si(1%) wire. Due to the presence of the CC-bridge underneath the hybrid flex, the the wire-bonds to the sensor may reach several milimeters-height (see Fig. 40). Each of the 80 ABCN25 chips of the module has a unique address. Appendix B describes the convention that has been followed for all modules.

## 6 Optimized design and improved material budget

Material improvements can be considered in the short-term by reducing the thickness of both the TPG baseboard and the CC-bridge, if the thermal and electrical performance of the module is not compromised. Further material reductions are expected in the near future with the next generation of ABCN chips (ABCN-13), produced in 130 nm with 256 channels per ASIC. In that case, the hybrid would have a single column of ten chips, allowing to read two segments of 1280 strips each. The width of the hybrid will be decreased significantly and a design with a single connector serving two hybrids is considered possible. With these realistic asumptions, a single 15 mm-wide hybrid (without connector), including SMDs and 10 ABCN-13 ASICs would make \(\sim\)0.17% X\({}_{0}\). A double-sided silicon module, with four hybrids, a single connector for two hybrids, a 300 \(\upmu\)m-thick CC-bridge and TPG would represent \(\sim\)1.7% X\({}_{0}\) with an estimated weight of \(\sim\)40 g, improving by \(\sim\)30% the total radiation length and \(\sim\)32% the estimated weight with respect to the current "as-built" module prototype presented in this note.

## 7 Summary

A double-sided silicon strip module is proposed as the detecting unit for the short-strip region of the upgraded ATLAS inner tracker. The module design has been presented in detail. The module consists in two silicon micro-strip sensors glued to a central TPG baseboard that provides the required mechanical stability while ensuring an optimal thermal path to dissipate the heat generated by the readout electronics. This module design present clear advantages over other possible approaches: repairaability and replaceability operations possible up to the latest assembly stage, accurate space-point formation for pattern recognition, complete hermeticity of the tracker in both \(R\phi\) and \(Z\), optimized large-scale production including QA in a world-wide collaboration, ease of testing in heterogenous environments (laboratories, irradiation areas, testbeam areas).

The current "as-built" prototypes represents a material budget of 2.44% X\({}_{0}\). A large fraction of the material budget is driven by the sensors and the hybrid. The CC-bridge represents 22% of the hybrid material budget. Significant material improvements are expected with the future ABCN13 ASICs and further optimizations in the hybrid design are underway. The thermal FEA simulations show excellent results in terms of sensor temperature uniformity (-13.5 \({}^{\circ}\)C within 1 \({}^{\circ}\)C assuming a for a coolant temper

ature of -30 \({}^{\circ}\)C with an Heat Transfer Coefficient of 4000W/m\({}^{2}\) K) and large safety margins with respect to mechanical stresses. For a large range of thermal grease conductivities simulated, the module design shows a safety factor of at least a factor of two with respect to the thermal runaway point.

Both the University of Geneva and KEK have built first module prototypes with the aim of validating the module design mainly in terms of electrical performance. The first modules assembled were used to exercice the assembly procedures and to address several issues that appeared with the first version of the KEK hybrid. Most of the problems were solved with a second version of the hybrid. The assembly sequence described in detail in this note shows that double-sided silicon modules are reasonable small objects that can be assembled without difficulty in most institutes.
