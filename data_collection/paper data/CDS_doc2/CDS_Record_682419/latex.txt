**Abstract**

A detailed study of associated Standard Model Higgs production (\(WH\) and \(t\bar{t}\,H\)) at the LHC (or a possible upgraded Tevatron collider), where the Higgs boson decays to \(b\bar{b}\) pairs, is reported for \(80~{}<~{}m_{H}~{}<~{}120~{}{\rm GeV}\). Even for optimistic \(b\)-tagging performances of the detector, the signal cannot be cleanly extracted from the background. For an integrated luminosity of \(10^{4}~{}pb^{-1}\) and \(m_{H}=100~{}{\rm GeV}\), one can expect at best \(\sim 110\) reconstructed \(H\to b\bar{b}\) decays from \(WH\) production, above a resonant background of \(\sim 150~{}WZ\) events and a non-resonant background of \(\sim 4800\) events, and \(\sim 100\) reconstructed \(b\bar{b}\) pairs (of which \(\sim 50\) from \(H\to b\bar{b}\) decay) from \(t\bar{t}H\) production, above a background of \(\sim 4000\) events. The main difficulty in extracting these two channels is in the expected low signal rate after reconstruction, the need for accurate control of all the background sources and for extremely good \(b\)-tagging performance. Nevertheless, for a few years of running at a luminosity of \(10^{33}\,cm^{-2}s^{-1}\), the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) channel may be the best way to probe the region \(80~{}<~{}m_{H}~{}<~{}100~{}{\rm GeV}\).

Introduction

Recent experimental results obtained at the Fermilab Tevatron by the CDF collaboration [1] have shown that high-performance \(b\)-tagging is possible at hadron colliders: high-p\({}_{T}\)\(b\)-jets, such as those expected from top quark decay, can be tagged with an efficiency of \(\sim 25\)-30% using secondary vertices, thereby rejecting light-quark jets by a factor \(\sim 150\). Similar, but lower efficiency, performance [1, 2] has been also achieved by tagging \(b\)-jets using soft leptons (muons and electrons of a few GeV p\({}_{T}\)).

These experimental results are highly encouraging for experiments at future hadron colliders, such as the LHC and a possible upgraded Tevatron [3] (\(p\overline{p}\) at 3.5 TeV). Several recent theoretical papers [4, 5] have claimed that \(H\to b\overline{b}\) decays may be observed above background at such machines. This is particularly interesting in the Higgs mass range, \(80<m_{H}<130\) GeV, where \(H\to b\overline{b}\) is the dominant decay mode and where discovery through other channels, such as \(H\to\gamma\gamma\), \(H\to Z\gamma\) or \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to llll\), although experimentally possible over some range of Higgs mass values, may need confirmation from as many observed decay channels as possible. This is true for the search for a Standard Model Higgs boson, but even more so for that for neutral Higgs bosons expected in supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model such as the MSSM [6].

In the study described here, performed in preparation for the Technical Proposal of the ATLAS collaboration, we concentrate mainly on the search for a Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with a \(W\) boson. In section 2 we present the signal and background channel production cross-sections, and in section 3 we discuss the methodology and cuts used for the experimental simulation, with some emphasis on the differences between parton-level and jet-level simulations for \(b\)-jet reconstruction. Section 4 describes the results obtained for the signal and various background processes at the LHC. Section 5 compares our results to those of [4], both for the LHC and a possible upgraded Tevatron. Finally, section 6 discusses the results obtained from a similar analysis for \(t\overline{t}H\) production with \(H\to b\overline{b}\).

## 2 Signal and background channels

### Basic processes

Higgs production in association with a \(W\) or \(Z\) boson is a priori the most promising signal production process for a search for \(H\to b\overline{b}\) decays. Leptonic decays (electron or muon) of the \(W\) or \(Z\) provide an isolated lepton for triggering the experiment. We do not seriously consider here the possibility of using \(Z\to\nu\overline{\nu}\) decays, as suggested in [4], because the trigger is much more difficult and the backgrounds are totally different from those considered for the \(W\), \(Z\) decays to electron or muon. In the following we therefore limit ourselves to the discussion of \(WH\) production with \(W\to l\nu\), since the \(ZH\) contribution with \(Z\to ll\) is not more than \(\sim 10\%\). The only other visible particles produced in the hard scattering process (HP) are the two \(b\)-quarks from the Higgs boson decay. This allows us to hope that adequate rejection of the very large backgrounds from \(t\bar{t}\) production can be obtained by vetoing the presence of any other high-\(p_{T}\) partons/jets or leptons in the final state. To summarise, we study here exclusive \(bb\bar{b}\) final states, with the goal of reconstructing a peak in the invariant mass spectrum of the \(b\bar{b}\) pairs.

The background channels can be divided into three classes:

\(\bullet\) irreducible backgrounds: \(WZ\to l\nu b\bar{b}\) and \(Wb\bar{b}\to l\nu b\bar{b}\). The first one is resonant in terms of \(m_{b\bar{b}}\) and is therefore of special concern for \(m_{H}\) close to \(m_{Z}\). The latter is dominated by \(q\bar{q}\to Wg\to Wb\bar{b}\), but also has a small contribution from \(q\bar{q}\to W^{*}\to t\bar{b}\to Wb\bar{b}\);

\(\bullet\) reducible backgrounds with at least two \(b\)-quarks in the final state: these are dominantly from \(t\bar{t}\to l\nu b\bar{b}+W\) and to a lesser extent from single top production through \(qg\to t\bar{b}q\to l\nu b\bar{b}+q\);

\(\bullet\) reducible backgrounds containing jets misidentified as \(b\)-jets: these arise mainly from \(Wjj\) production and their magnitude obviously depends on the quality of the \(b\)-tagging performance.

### Event generators

In this study we have used wherever possible the PYTHIA 5.7 Monte Carlo program [7], as an event generator for the hard scattering process using the appropriate leading order (LO) matrix element (ME) calculations, and as a full event generator with the parton shower approximation, thus including initial state radiation (ISR), final state radiation (FSR) and hadronization/decays (HD).

It is however well known that the parton shower approximation does not always correctly reproduce rates nor relevant kinematical distributions of additional jets in certain physics processes, as in e.g. \(gg\to Zb\bar{b}\)[8] or \(W\,+\,n-jet\) production [9]. Therefore, in the cases where the LO matrix element calculation is not available in PYTHIA 5.7, we have used separate code to fully simulate the events and/or to cross-check the results obtained with PYTHIA 5.7:

\(\bullet\) for the \(Wb\bar{b}\) background we have used the ME calculations of [10], interfaced to HERWIG 5.6 [11];

\(\bullet\) for \(qg\to t\bar{b}q\to l\nu b\bar{b}+q\) production we have used PYTHIA 5.7, which has been cross-checked in the past [12] to some extent by comparison to a complete ME calculation;

\(\bullet\) for the \(Wjj\) channel we have used the full tree-level ME calculations available in the LDW event generator [13] to properly normalise at the parton level the results obtained using PYTHIA 5.7 (where \(Wj\) events are produced through the correct ME calculation and the second jet is produced in the parton shower process).

No K-factors were included in the rates presented below since they are not available for all processes considered here. Including them for the signal [14] and those of the background processes where they have been calculated does not change the final results significantly, and would certainly add some confusion when comparingto other studies of these channels.

We have used the recent CTEQ LO parameterization [15] for the structure functions. The top quark was assumed to have a mass of 170 GeV and to decay to \(Wb\) before hadronization. The \(b\)-quarks were fragmented using the parameterization of [16] with \(\epsilon_{b}=\) -0.006.

### Expected production rates

Table 1 shows the production cross-sections of the signal and various backgrounds for \(p\bar{p}\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=3.5\) TeV and \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. The \(H,Z\to b\bar{b}\) and \(W\to l\nu\) branching ratios are included. The \(Wjj\) cross-sections are quoted for parton transverse momenta above 15 GeV and angular separation above 30\({}^{\circ}\).

The dominant uncertainties on these expected rates arise from higher order corrections and the structure function parameterization. A larger uncertainty is expected for \(Wjj\) production, due to known limitations in the perturbative QCD calculations for \(p_{T}^{j}\) as low as 15 GeV. In all cases the Monte-Carlo statistics used in this study were such that the statistical uncertainty was much smaller than the above theoretical uncertainties, which in the worst cases are as large as a factor \(\sim 2\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c||c||c|c||} \hline \hline Final state : \(lb\bar{b}\) & Event generator & \(\sqrt{s}~{}=~{}3.5\) TeV & \(\sqrt{s}~{}=~{}14\) TeV \\  & & \(\sigma[pb]\) & \(\sigma[pb]\) \\ \hline \hline \(W\,H\) & PYTHIA 5.7 & & \\ \(m_{H}~{}=~{}80\) GeV & & 0.173 & 0.769 \\ \(m_{H}~{}=~{}100\) GeV & & 0.091 & 0.405 \\ \(m_{H}~{}=~{}120\) GeV & & 0.045 & 0.209 \\ \hline \hline \(W\,Z\) & PYTHIA 5.7 & 0.19 & 0.86 \\ \hline \hline \(W\,b\bar{b}\) & ME + HERWIG 5.6 & 19.9 & 69.3 \\ \hline \(q\bar{q}\to W\to t\bar{b}\) & HERWIG 5.6 & 0.28 & 1.42 \\ \hline \hline \(t\bar{t}\) & PYTHIA 5.7 & 12.1 & 266.1 \\ \hline \(qg\to Wg\to t\bar{b}q\) & PYTHIA 5.7 & 2.86 & 45.6 \\ \hline \hline \(Wjj\) (see text) & LDW & 620.0 & 5480.0 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: _Production cross-sections for WH signal and background processes._The signal cross-section is \(\sim 4.5\) times larger at the LHC, independently of \(\mbox{m}_{H}\), whereas the background cross-sections are between \(3.5\) (\(Wb\overline{b}\)) and \(22\) (\(t\overline{t}\)) times larger. If \(t\overline{t}\) were the only background and if these ratios were preserved after selection cuts and event reconstruction, one would therefore expect similar significances for a potential signal at both machines for the same integrated luminosity. The signal rates before cuts and reconstruction appear quite comfortable for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\), even at the upgraded Tevatron machine.

## 3 Simulation of experimental cuts

### Simulation procedures

Most studies performed until now used parton-level simulations, which often lead to too optimistic results. In order, therefore, not only to present the results of our study for ATLAS, but also to compare them to those of [4], two simulation procedures were applied:

\(\bullet\) a) parton-level procedure: this simulation generates the hard scattering process (e.g. \(WH\), \(Wb\overline{b}\), \(t\overline{t}\)...), then simulates the appropriate decays (e.g. \(W\to l\nu\), \(H\to b\overline{b}\), \(t\to Wb\) with \(W\to q\overline{q}\)...). The final state products thus consist of charged leptons, neutrinos and partons to which the selection criteria described below are applied;

\(\bullet\) b) jet-level procedure: this simulation generates the full event, including QCD or QED initial and final state radiation, fragmentation, hadronization and decays of unstable particles. The final state particles are then submitted to a jet-clustering algorithm, after which isolated leptons, \(b\)-jets and non \(b\)-jets can be selected.

The comparison of these two procedures for the same generated hard scattering events explains the large differences observed between the parton-level and the more realistic jet-level simulations in some cases, such as reconstruction of \(b\)-jets (section 3.2.3) and of \(b\overline{b}\) invariant masses (section 3.2.4)

### Selection criteria

We describe here the selection criteria used to study in some detail the differences between parton-level and jet-level simulations, for the signal and the dominant background processes (see section 4), and to evaluate the expected performance at the LHC. These selection criteria were chosen optimistically in terms of \(p_{T}\)-thresholds and pseudorapidity coverages for ATLAS, mainly so as to estimate whether there is any hope to see this difficult channel at the LHC. We restrict ourselves for the moment to selection criteria, which can be achieved at the initial luminosity of \(10^{33}\)\(cm^{-2}s^{-1}\).

#### 3.2.1 Trigger lepton

The trigger lepton is required to have pseudorapidity \(|\eta^{l}|<2.5\) and transverse momentum \(\mbox{p}_{T}^{l}>6\) GeV for muons and 30 GeV for electrons. In addition this trigger lepton is required to be isolated:

\(\bullet\) it is required to be at a distance \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}\ +\ \Delta\phi^{2}}>0.7\) from any parton/jet which passes the selection criteria;

\(\bullet\) at the jet-level, the total hadronic transverse energy in a cone, \(\Delta R\ <0.3\), around the lepton is required to be below 10 GeV. Non-isolated muons with \(|\eta^{l}|<2.5\) and electrons with \(|\eta^{l}|<5.0\) are considered as jets for \(\mbox{p}_{T}^{l}>15\) GeV.

#### 3.2.2 Jet reconstruction

In the jet-level procedure jets are formed from calorimeter cells of granularity \(\Delta\ \eta\ \times\ \Delta\ \phi\ =\ 0.1\ \times\ 0.1\), where particle energies are stored with an energy smearing of \(\sigma_{E}=0.5\ \times\ \sqrt{E}\ \oplus\ 0.03\ \times\ E\). Only cells with total transverse energy above a threshold of 1 GeV were used to collect the jet energy in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.4\).

A parton or jet was accepted by the selection criteria if it had a transverse energy \(\mbox{p}_{T}\ >15\) GeV and \(|\eta^{jet}|<5.0\) (overall acceptance of ATLAS hadron calorimetry). It was called a \(b\)-jet at parton-level if it was within \(|\eta^{b-jet}|<2.5\) (overall acceptance of ATLAS inner tracker). At the jet-level, the \(b\)-jet was required in addition to be within \(\Delta R<0.2\) from a \(b\)-quark with \(\mbox{p}_{T}>5\) GeV (after ISR and FSR). A \(b\)-jet

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \hline Particle type & Cut \\ \hline \hline Leptons & Trigger lepton with: \(\mbox{p}_{T}^{l}\ >\ 6\) GeV (muons) or 30 GeV (electrons), \\  & \(|\eta^{l}|\ <\ 2.5\) and isolation \\ \hline \hline \(b\)-jets & Two \(b\)-jets with: \(\mbox{p}_{T}^{b-jet}\ >\ 15\) GeV and \(|\eta^{b-jet}|<2.5\) \\  & \(\Delta R_{b-jet,b-jet}\ >\ 0.7\) and \(\Delta R_{b-jet,l}\ >\ 0.7\) \\ \hline \hline Lepton veto & No other isolated lepton with: \(\mbox{p}_{T}^{l}\ >\ 6\) GeV and \(|\eta^{l}|<2.5\) \\ Jet veto & No other jet with: \(\mbox{p}_{T}^{jet}\ >\ 15\) GeV and \(|\eta^{jet}|<5.0\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: _Selection criteria for \(lb\bar{b}\) events._pair is accepted if the \(b\)-jets are separated by \(\Delta R\ >\) 0.7. The event was accepted if it contained two (and only two) \(b\)-jets.

In order to reduce backgrounds from \(t\overline{t}\) production, a lepton veto and a jet veto were applied. Events with a second isolated charged lepton with \(\mathrm{p}_{T}^{i}\ >\) 6 GeV and \(|\eta^{i}|\ <\ 2.5\) were rejected, as well as events with any additional jet with \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\ >\) 15 GeV within \(|\eta^{jet}|\ <\ 5.0\).

#### 3.2.3 Comparison of parton-level and jet-level procedures

For \(WH\) production at the LHC, table 3 shows the probability that a lepton or quark, accepted by the parton-level procedure, passes the jet-level selection criteria, as a function of the ingredients used in the jet-level event generation. If only the hard scattering process (HP) is generated, both procedures agree to better than 1%, as expected since the jet-level procedure is then applied to the final state leptons and partons. The agreement remains excellent if initial state radiation (ISR) is included (some leptons are lost because of the isolation cuts). However, if final state radiation (FSR) and hadronization/decays (HD) are included, the efficiency for \(b\)-jets drops to 77%. This is due to the fact that the original \(b\)-quark from Higgs decay loses a significant fraction of its energy through FSR and HD. This 77% efficiency is probably still optimistic since magnetic field effects, which are expected to be significant for jets with \(\mathrm{p}_{T}^{jet}\ \sim\) 15 GeV, were not included in the simulation.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c||c|c||} \hline Event generation & Lepton & b-jet \\ \hline \hline HP & 99\% & 99\% \\ \hline HP+ ISR & 97\% & 99\% \\ \hline HP+ ISR + FSR & 96\% & 86\% \\ \hline HP+ ISR + FSR + HD & 96\% & 77\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: _Probability to accept a lepton or b-jet at the jet-level if it was accepted by the parton-level cuts as a function of the ingredients used in the event generation for the WH signal at the LHC._In conclusion, table 3 shows that less than 60% of the \(H\to b\overline{b}\) decays with \(p_{T}^{b,\bar{b}}>15\) GeV are reconstructed as events containing two \(b\)-jets with \(p_{T}^{jet}>15\) GeV. These losses depend of course on the \(b\)-quark \(p_{T}\)-distribution and therefore on the process considered. Table 4 shows for example that the lepton efficiency for \(t\bar{t}\) events is lower than for the \(WH\) signal (less isolated leptons) and that the \(b\)-jet reconstruction efficiency is higher (higher-energy \(b\)-quarks are produced in top decay).

#### 3.2.4 Reconstruction of the Higgs mass peak

The last step in the event analysis is the reconstruction of the invariant mass of the two \(b\)-jets. Table 5 shows that a significant additional loss of signal events also occurs in this step, when going from the parton-level simulation (HP) to the more realistic jet-level simulation. This is again due to final state radiation and hadronization/decays. The first effect seen in the jet-level simulation is a large shift in the mass peak from 100 GeV to \(\sim 80\) GeV for \(m_{H}=100\) GeV. This can of course be calibrated away (by using for example \(WZ\) background events), but the background contributions have to be estimated in the appropriate mass region. The second effect is a degradation of the mass resolution from 7 GeV at the parton-level to 11 GeV at the jet-level. Finally the last effect is that the fraction of events lost outside a 4\(\sigma\) mass-bin is much smaller at the parton-level, \(\sim 4\%\) loss outside (100 \(\pm\) 15) GeV, than at the jet-level, \(\sim 20\%\) loss outside (80 \(\pm\) 20) GeV, due to the asymmetric tail observed in the mass distribution reconstructed at the jet-level, as illustrated in fig. 1 for \(m_{H}=100\) GeV.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c||c|c|c||} \hline Process & Event generator & Lepton & b-jet \\ \hline \hline \(WH\) & PYTHIA 5.7 & 96\% & 77\% \\ \hline \(Wb\overline{b}\) & HERWIG 5.6 & 98\% & 76\% \\ \hline \(t\overline{b}\) & HERWIG 5.6 & 97\% & 85\% \\ \hline \(t\overline{t}\) & PYTHIA 5.7 & 94\% & 81\% \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

For example, as shown in fig. 2, increasing the jet cone size to \(\Delta R=0.7\) and relaxing the \(b\)-quark matching criterion to \(\Delta R\ <0.3\), decreases the mass shift from 19 GeV to 16 GeV and increases the mass resolution from 11.0 GeV to 12.3 GeV. In addition the reconstruction efficiency per \(b\)-jet increases from 77% to 79% and the efficiency of the mass cut increases only from 81% to 87%.

#### 3.2.5 Tagging of reconstructed \(b\)-jets

For \(WH\) signal events passing the selection criteria discussed above, fig. 3a shows the fraction of the reconstructed \(b\)-jet \(p_{T}\) carried by the \(B\)-hadron. For the chosen cone size of \(\Delta R~{}=~{}0.4\), this fraction is on average \(\sim 95\%\). However, as shown in fig. 3b, the \(b\)-jet itself carries only on average \(\sim 80\%\) of the \(p_{T}\) of the \(b\)-quark produced in the \(H~{}\to b\bar{b}\) decays. These plots illustrate well some of the large differences between the parton-level simulation of \(b\)-quark reconstruction and the simulation of \(b\)-tagging in a real experiment.

Figure 3: _The ratio of the transverse momenta of: (a) B-hadron to reconstructed \(b\)-jet and (b) reconstructed b-jet to b-quark from \(H\to b\bar{b}\) decays for WH signal events._In order to explore the expected inner tracker environment, when attempting to tag \(b\)-jets in this search, fig. 4 shows, for three choices of charged particle \(p_{T}\)-thresholds, the expected numbers of charged particles found within the \(b\)-jet cone for \(\Delta R=0.4\). These distributions are shown for all charged particles in the cone in fig. 4a, and only for those originating from the decay of the \(B\)-hadron in fig. 4b.

Figure 4: _For reconstructed b-jets within a cone of \(\Delta R=0.4\), distributions of the numbers of: (a) all charged particles and (b) charged particles from B-hadron decay. Distributions are for all \(p_{T}\) (top), \(p_{T}>1\) GeV (middle) and \(p_{T}>5\) GeV (bottom)._

The average numbers of charged particles expected, for all \(p_{T}\), for \(p_{T}\ >1\) GeV, and for \(p_{T}\ >5\) GeV, are displayed in table 6, for \(b\)-jet cone sizes of \(\Delta R=0.4\) and 0.7. Clearly a cone size of \(\Delta R=0.4\) is sufficient to measure more than 90% of the charged particles from the \(B\)-hadron decay. For a realistic threshold of \(p_{T}\ >1\) GeV, this cone size englobes on average \(\sim 4.8\) charged tracks from \(B\)-hadron decay, \(\sim 2.4\) charged tracks from the \(b\)-quark fragmentation and from the underlying event, and a negligible number (\(<\ 0.2\)) from minimum bias pile-up at a luminosity of \(10^{33}\ cm^{-2}s^{-1}\).

Obviously a detailed study of these \(b\)-jets, using the full simulation of the ATLAS inner tracker, is needed to evaluate how the \(b\)-jet tagging efficiency \(\epsilon_{b}\) varies as a function of the rejection R of the non-\(b\) jets. In the next sections, we will compare the expected \(WH\) signal rates to the various backgrounds, assuming a range of plausible to optimistic values for \(\epsilon_{b}\) and R.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c||c||c|c||} \hline  & Average number & \(\Delta R=\ 0.4\) & \(\Delta R=\ 0.7\) \\ \hline \hline  & In \(b\)-jet & 9.2 & 11.8 \\ All \(p_{T}\) & & & \\  & In \(B\)-hadron & 5.4 & 5.6 \\ \hline \hline  & In \(b\)-jet & 7.2 & 8.0 \\ \(p_{T}\ >\ 1\) GeV & & & \\  & In \(B\)-hadron & 4.8 & 4.9 \\ \hline \hline  & In \(b\)-jet & 2.8 & 2.8 \\ \(p_{T}\ >\ 5\) GeV & & & \\  & In \(B\)-hadron & 2.2 & 2.2 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

These multiplicities are given for all \(p_{T},\,for\,p_{T}\ >\ 1\) GeV and for \(p_{T}\ >\ 5\) GeV._

## 4 Expected signal and background rates

### \(Wh\) signal rate and acceptance

Table 7 compares the expected signal event rates and acceptances at parton-level and at jet-level, for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\) and for \(m_{H}=100\) GeV. The selection criteria are those described above; we recall in particular that the chosen mass windows are different at parton-level (\(85<m_{b\bar{b}}<115\) GeV) and at jet-level (\(60<m_{b\bar{b}}<100\) GeV). It is also important to note that the \(b\)-tagging efficiency \(\epsilon_{b}\) is not included in the overall acceptance.

The trigger lepton acceptance is \(\sim 65\%\) and does not depend much on the details of the simulation procedure. On the other hand, as discussed above, the acceptance of the \(b\)-jet selection criteria is much lower at the jet-level (\(\sim 40\%\)) than at the parton-level (\(\sim 63\%\)).

The parton-level procedure uses by definition only the hard scattering process and, therefore, has an acceptance of 100% for the lepton and jet veto cuts. For the jet-level simulation, the acceptance of the lepton veto cut remains close to 100%, because high-\(p_{T}\) isolated leptons are seldom produced through initial or final state radiation and in the underlying event. In contrast however, additional jets are often expected through initial/final state radiation, and this accounts for the low acceptance (\(\sim 57\%\)) of the jet-veto cut. Relaxing the jet-veto threshold from 15 to 30 GeV

\begin{tabular}{||c||c|c||c|c||} \hline Cuts & Parton-level & Parton-level & Jet-level & Jet-level \\ \hline  & Events & Acceptance & Events & Acceptance \\ \hline \hline Trigger lepton & 2626 & 65\% & 2618 & 64\% \\ \hline \(+\)\(b\)-jets & 1672 & 41\% & 1062 & 26\% \\ \hline \(+\) lepton veto & 1672 & 41\% & 1056 & 26\% \\ \hline \(+\) jet veto & 1672 & 41\% & 606 & 15\% \\ \hline \(+\) mass window & 1576 & 39\% & 491 & 12\% \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

### Background rates and acceptances

We restrict ourselves here to the more realistic jet-level simulation and describe the acceptances of the selection cuts for the various background processes presented in section 2. Table 8 gives, for the various background processes, the acceptances of the jet-level selection criteria, and also the expected event rates after all cuts with \(60<m_{b\overline{b}}<100\) GeV and for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{4}\ pb^{-1}\). The efficiency of the lepton identification and \(b\)-tagging and the rejection of non-\(b\) jets are not included in these numbers.

#### 4.2.1 \(Wz\) channel

The acceptances for the resonant \(WZ\) channel are somewhat lower than for the \(WH\) signal with \(m_{H}=100\) GeV, mainly because \(m_{Z}\) is less than \(m_{H}\) and therefore the \(b\)-jets are less energetic. In the mass window, however, more events from \(WZ\) are expected than from \(WH\) because of the larger \(WZ\) production cross-section (see also fig. 5a).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c||c|c|c|c||c|c|} \hline \hline Background & Trigger & + & + lepton & + jet & + mass & Event \\ channel & lepton & b-jets & veto & veto & window & rate \\ \hline \hline \(WZ\) & 59\% & 19\% & 19\% & 10\% & 7.7\% & 670 \\ \hline \(Wb\overline{b}\) & 53\% & 3.5\% & 3.5\% & 2.6\% & 0.6\% & 4070 \\ \hline \(q\overline{q}\to W\to t\overline{b}\) & 61\% & 35\% & 35\% & 15\% & 4.4\% & 640 \\ \hline \(t\overline{t}\) & 73\% & 40\% & 31\% & 1.0\% & 0.2\% & 5750 \\ \hline \(qg\to Wg\to t\overline{b}q\) & 70\% & 3.5\% & 3.5\% & 0.1\% & 0.05\% & 230 \\ \hline \hline \(Wjj\) & 51\% & 6.2\% & 6.2\% & 5\% & 1.4\% & 5.9 \(\cdot\ 10^{6}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

#### 4.2.2 \(Wb\bar{b}\) channel

The acceptance of the \(b\)-jet selection cuts is much lower in this channel, because the \(b\bar{b}\) pair is produced through gluon splitting. This results in a much softer \(b\)-quark \(p_{T}\)-spectrum and therefore a much lower probability of reconstructing two \(b\)-jets which pass the kinematical cuts (even at parton-level this probability is only 12%). The gluon splitting mechanism also induces a distribution of \(m_{b\bar{b}}\) peaked at small values of \(m_{b\bar{b}}\), typically around 40 GeV for \(p_{T}^{b}\ >15\) GeV, as shown in fig. 5b. The shape of this mass distribution is not affected much when going from the parton-level to the jet-level simulation, but the contribution from this channel is sensitive to the exact choice of the mass window.

The parton shower approximation was also used to generate \(Wb\bar{b}\) events in the framework of PYTHIA 5.7. It was found that PYTHIA 5.7 overestimates the \(Wb\bar{b}\) event rates by \(\sim 40\%\) after cuts and by \(\sim 60\%\) in the mass window. On the other hand, this procedure gave an estimate of the ratio of \(Wc\bar{c}/Wb\bar{b}\), which was found to decrease from \(\sim 3\) at production (no selection cuts) to \(\sim 1.4\) after all the selection cuts. Although charm jets contain long-lived hadrons, they are expected to be tagged with much lower efficiency than \(b\)-jets, and we therefore conclude that the \(Wb\bar{b}\) background is much larger than the \(Wc\bar{c}\) background after all cuts.

#### 4.2.3 \(q\bar{q}\to\ W\ \to\ t\bar{b}\ \to\ Wb\bar{b}\) channel

This channel has a production cross-section almost two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the \(Wb\bar{b}\) background. Therefore, as shown in table 8, although its acceptance is almost ten times larger than that of \(Wb\bar{b}\), it only increases the \(Wb\bar{b}\) background by \(\sim 20\%\).

#### 4.2.4 \(t\bar{t}\) channel

This channel results in a \(WWb\bar{b}\) final state, where the extra \(W\) may decay into leptons or jets. This leads to large differences between parton-level and jet-level simulations because of the complexity and variety of final state topologies. The lepton and jet vetoes provide a large overall rejection of \(\sim 40\) against this channel, as shown in table 8. The \(t\bar{t}\) events remaining after the veto cuts can be split in terms of the decay of the extra \(W\): 40% \(W\to\tau\nu\), 27% \(W\to\mu\nu\), 21% \(W\to\ e\nu\) and only 12% \(W\to\ q\bar{q}\). For these events, the distribution of \(m_{b\bar{b}}\) is almost flat in the region \(50\ <\ m_{b\bar{b}}\ <150\) GeV (see also fig. 5c).

#### 4.2.5 \(qg\to Wg\to t\bar{b}q\) channel

As for the \(Wb\bar{b}\) channel, the acceptance of the \(b\)-jet selection cuts for this channel is quite low. In addition the extra quark-jet in the final state can be efficiently tagged at large pseudorapidity, leading to a large rejection of the jet-veto cut. Background

### Significance of \(Wh\) signal

Table 10 presents the expected rates for the \(WH\) signal with \(m_{H}=100\) GeV and for the background processes with \(60~{}<~{}m_{b\overline{b}}~{}<~{}100\) GeV, for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{4}~{}pb^{-1}\). A trigger lepton efficiency of 90% has been included in all rates. The second column gives these rates as a function of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency \(\epsilon_{b}\) and the rejection R of non-\(b\) jets. For \(\epsilon_{b}=100\%\) and an infinite rejection R, the significance of the Higgs signal would be 4.4 for a total of 442 observed signal events. Even this ideal number is over-optimistic, since the resonant \(WZ\) background is naively treated in the same way as the non-resonant backgrounds and since additional likely signal losses, due to magnetic field effects and lower \(b\)-tagging acceptance in pseudorapidity, have not been included. For a Higgs mass approximately equal to the Z-boson mass, the signal may only be extracted by comparing the measured rate of \(b\overline{b}\) pairs in the peak to that expected from WZ events alone, which will be predicted to an accuracy of better than \(\sim\pm 20\%\) using WZ decays into three leptons and a neutrino. The significance in this mass region will therefore be significantly degraded due to lack of accurate knowledge of the resonant background.

The last two columns of table 10 show that for realistic (\(\epsilon_{b}=30\%\) and R = 100) and even for optimistic (\(\epsilon_{b}=50\%\) and R = 50) \(b\)-tagging performance values, the signal will be very difficult to extract from the background. Table 11 (\(\epsilon_{b}=30\%\) and R = 100) and table 12 (\(\epsilon_{b}=50\%\) and R = 50) demonstrate that the expected significance improves with decreasing \(m_{H}\). This is mostly due to the larger production rates at smaller values of \(m_{H}\). As shown in fig. 5, the backgrounds from \(Wb\overline{b}\), \(Wjj\) and \(Wjb\) are about a factor of 2 larger for \(m_{H}=80\) GeV than for \(m_{H}=120\) GeV, but vary fairly smoothly as a function of \(m_{b\overline{b}}\) as does the \(t\overline{t}\) background. The notable exception to this last feature is of course the \(WZ\) background, which hopefullycan be calibrated accurately using \(WZ\) events with purely leptonic decays of the vector bosons. For R = 50, the backgrounds from non-\(b\) jets are slightly larger than those from real \(b\)-jets; this indicates that the \(b\)-tagging performance of the ATLAS inner tracker should provide a rejection R of at least \(\sim\) 100 against light quark jets and \(\sim\) 20 against charm jets.

## 5 The LHC versus the upgraded Tevatron

We now briefly compare our results with those of [4], both for the LHC and for a possible upgraded Tevatron (\(p\overline{p}\) at \(\sqrt{s}\ =\ 3.5\) TeV). We therefore adopt here the selection cuts used in [4]:

Figure 5: _For an integrated luminosity of \(10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) at the LHC, for a lepton identification efficiency of 90% and for \(\epsilon_{b}\) = 30% and R = 100, expected \(m_{b\overline{b}}\) spectra after all cuts for: (a) the \(WH\) signal with \(m_{H}\) = 100 GeV (solid line) and the resonant \(WZ\) background (dashed line), (b) the \(Web\overline{b}\) background, (c) the \(t\overline{t}\) background and (d) the \(Wjj\) background._\(\bullet\) The trigger lepton is required to have \(p_{T}^{l}\ >\ 20\) GeV, pseudorapidity \(|\eta^{l}|\ <\ 2.5\) and to be isolated from the \(b\)-jets (or partons), i.e. \(\Delta R_{b-jet,l}\ >\ 0.7\). Events with an additional lepton with \(p_{T}^{l}\ >\ 10\) GeV are rejected. Cuts are also applied on the missing transverse energy, \(E_{T}^{miss}\ >\ 20\) GeV and on the transverse mass, \(m_{T}^{l,miss}\ =\ \sqrt{2p_{T}^{i}\,E_{T}^{miss}(1-cos\Delta\phi_{i,miss})}\ <\ 85\) GeV; \(\bullet\) Events are accepted if they contain exactly two \(b\)-jets (or partons) with \(p_{T}^{b-jet}\ >\ 15\) GeV, pseudorapidity \(|\eta^{b-jet}|\ <\ 2.0\) and \(\Delta R_{b-jet,b-jet}\ >\ 0.7\); \(\bullet\) Events are accepted if they contain no additional jet with \(p_{T}^{jet}\ >\ 30\) GeV and \(|\eta^{jet}|\ <\ 4.0\) and not more than one additional jet with \(p_{T}^{jet}\ >\ 15\) GeV and \(|\eta^{jet}|\ <\ 4.0\); \(\bullet\) The \(b\)-tagging efficiency is assumed to be \(\epsilon_{b}\) = 30% and the rejection of non-\(b\) jets is taken to be R = 100; \(\bullet\) To define the final signal and background rates, a mass window of 100 \(\pm\) 17 GeV at the parton-level and 80 \(\pm\) 17 GeV at the jet-level was used.

No lepton identification efficiency is included. Shown are the parton-level results of [4] (second column) and the parton-level (third column) and jet-level (last column) results of our analysis._For the \(WH\) signal, these cuts lead, at the jet-level, to a lower acceptance of 8.4% as compared to 12% for the optimal ATLAS cuts defined in section 3. This is mainly due to the much lower \(p_{T}\)-threshold of 6 GeV chosen for the muons and to the larger \(\eta\)-coverage for tagging \(b\)-jets in the latter case. The use of the transverse mass cut also reduces the acceptance by \(\sim\) 30% for the signal without much gain on the signal to background ratio if a realistic experimental resolution is included for the missing transverse momentum measurement. Some of this loss of acceptance is recovered however by the looser jet veto cuts used in [4].

Table 13 shows, for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\) at the LHC, the expected signal and background rates after applying the cuts defined above. In the second column we quote the results of [4], which can be compared to our parton-level (third column) and jet-level (last column) results. Although the expected significances agree to better than 10% at the parton-level, the backgrounds with complex final state topologies, such as \(t\overline{t}\) and \(t\overline{b}q\), differ by large factors between the two analyses. As discussed in detail in section 3.2.3, the most striking result is however the

\begin{table}

No lepton identification efficiency is included. Shown are the parton-level results of [4] (second column) and the parton-level (third column) and jet-level (last column) results of our analysis._very large difference in significance observed between the parton-level and jet-level simulations, which is mainly due to the much smaller signal acceptance obtained at the more realistic jet-level. This reduces greatly the hopes one may have had from the optimistic conclusions of [4], that such a channel may be observed above background at the LHC.

This conclusion applies even more to a possible upgraded Tevatron machine, as shown in table 14 for \(\sqrt{s}=3.5\) TeV \(p\bar{p}\) collisions and for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\) (\([!!]\)). The expected significances are almost identical to those predicted for the LHC; this is essentially due to the fact that the \(t\bar{t}\) background is much smaller at the lower energy. The \(WH\) signal itself is however smaller by a factor \(\sim 2\) at the lower energy. For signal rates as low as \(\sim 10\) events per year and sizeable residual backgrounds, the real experimental significance will be obviously even smaller than the naive computation of \(S/\sqrt{B}\).

In conclusion to this section, our results agree qualitatively with those of [4] at the parton-level, but the more realistic jet-level results demonstrate that large signal losses, which cannot be predicted at the parton-level, will occur in the experiment, and that discovery of the Higgs boson in its dominant \(H\to b\overline{b}\) decay mode, for \(m_{H}\sim 100\) GeV, will be extremely difficult even with high-performance \(b\)-tagging. Although the background situation is more favourable at lower energy, the overall prospects are worse because the signal rates are too low.

## 6 Search for a signal in the \(t\bar{t}H\) channel

This channel has also been proposed as a viable channel to search for \(H\to b\overline{b}\) decays [17]. It has a production cross-section very close to that of the \(WH\) channel for \(m_{top}=170\) GeV. The final state is however much more complex, consisting of \(WWb\overline{b}b\overline{b}\) instead of \(Wb\overline{b}\). In this study, we will therefore replace the jet veto cuts, which provided a large rejection against the dominant \(t\bar{t}\) background in the \(WH\) signal search, by the requirement of three or even four tagged \(b\)-jets in the final state in addition to the trigger lepton. The Higgs signal would thus appear as a peak in the invariant \(b\overline{b}\) mass distribution, above the combinatorial background from the signal itself and from the various background processes. These can be divided into two classes:

\(\bullet\) Irreducible backgrounds, such as the resonant \(t\bar{t}Z\) channel and \(t\bar{t}b\overline{b}\) production;

\(\bullet\) Reducible backgrounds containing jets misidentified as \(b\)-jets, such as \(t\bar{t}j\), \(Wjjj\), \(Wb\overline{b}j\) etc. Their magnitude obviously will depend even more than for the \(WH\) channel on the quality of the \(b\)-tagging performance.

Table 15 shows the production cross-sections at the LHC for the \(t\bar{t}H\) signal, the resonant \(t\bar{t}Z\) background and the reducible \(Wjjj\) background (the \(Wjjj\) cross-section is quoted for parton transverse momenta above 15 GeV and angular separation above 30\({}^{\circ}\)). The \(H,Z\to b\overline{b}\) and \(W\to l\nu\) branching ratios are included. The basic cross-sections for other backgrounds can be found in table 1. The irreducible

\(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) background and the reducible backgrounds from \(t\bar{t}j\) and \(Wbbj\) are generated, using the event generators specified in table 1 and the parton shower approximation to obtain the extra jet or jets from initial/final state radiation.

The \(t\bar{t}H\) signal production cross-sections are remarkably similar to the \(WH\) signal cross-sections quoted in table 1. The resonant \(t\bar{t}Z\) background cross-section is however much lower than the \(WZ\) background cross-section. The strong Higgs coupling to the top quark is of great help here to enhance the Higgs contribution with respect to the \(Z\) one. The uncertainties on the production cross-sections used for the study of this channel are significantly larger than for the \(WH\) study, since we rely more heavily on the parton shower approximation and the jet multiplicities in the final state are larger. A smaller value of the top quark mass, for example 150 GeV, would increase the \(t\bar{t}\) background by a factor 1.7 and the signal only by 4%.

The selection cuts (applied at the jet-level) are quite straightforward:

\(\bullet\) The trigger lepton is required to satisfy the same cuts as for the \(WH\) search (see section 3.2.1);

\(\bullet\) Events are accepted if they contain three or four \(b\)-jets with \(p_{T}^{b-jet}>15\) GeV and \(|\eta^{b-jet}|<2.5\). The \(b\)-jets are required to be well separated from each other and from the trigger lepton, i.e. \(\Delta R_{b-jet,b-jet}>0.7\) and \(\Delta R_{b-jet,l}>0.7\).

The reconstruction efficiencies for the \(t\bar{t}H\) signal are quite similar to those obtained for the \(WH\) signal. For \(m_{H}=100\) GeV, 20% of the events contain two reconstructed \(b\)-jets, 44% contain three \(b\)-jets and 32% contain four \(b\)-jets. However, only 39% of all reconstructed \(b\)-jets come from \(H\to b\bar{b}\) decay, whereas 61% come from top quark

Table 15: _Production cross-sections for \(t\bar{t}H\) signal and background processes._decay. This indicates that the combinatorial background from the signal itself will be quite large when searching for a peak in the invariant mass of two tagged \(b\)-jets.

Before searching for the Higgs mass peak, we first present the expected rates of signal and background events for three different \(b\)-tagging performances:

\(\bullet\)\(\epsilon_{b}\) = 30% and R = 100;

\(\bullet\)\(\epsilon_{b}\) = 50% and R = 50;

\(\bullet\)\(\epsilon_{b}\) = 70% and R = 10.

We stress again that these values do not yet reflect any expected realistic performance of the ATLAS detector, but are rather used to emphasise the even greater importance of high-efficiency \(b\)-tagging (rather than large rejection of non-\(b\) jets) in this channel which contains four \(b\)-quarks in the final state.

Tables 16 (for three tagged \(b\)-jets) and 17 (for four tagged \(b\)-jets) show the expected rates after reconstruction, but before selection in the appropriate mass window. The \(t\bar{t}H\) signal rates are much larger than the resonant \(t\bar{t}Z\) background, in con

The results are shown for the \(b\)-tagging performances described in the text._trast to the \(WH\) case. The largest of all background sources is that from \(t\bar{t}+jet(s)\). Only for the lowest values of the non-\(b\) jet rejection, \(R~{}=~{}10\), are the \(Wjjj(j)\) backgrounds to be also considered, since they then amount to \(\sim 50\%\) (resp. \(30\%\)) of the \(t\bar{t}\) background for three (resp. four) tagged \(b\)-jets. The uncertainties on the expected rates of \(Wjjj\) and \(Wjjjj\) events are of course very large.

The signal rates for four tagged \(b\)-jets are too low except for values of \(\epsilon_{b}\) larger than \(50\%\). In the following we will therefore concentrate on the events with three tagged \(b\)-jets. Table 18 shows, for \(m_{H}=100\) GeV and for the three \(b\)-tagging performances considered, the respective true \(b\)-jet multiplicities in the accepted \(t\bar{t}H\) signal and \(t\bar{t}\) background events. Most signal events contain three true \(b\)-jets, but for \(R~{}=~{}10\), as many as \(22\%\) contain one non-\(b\) jet tagged as a \(b\)-jet. In contrast the \(t\bar{t}\) background events contain in most cases the two true \(b\)-jets from top quark decay, but seldom a third true \(b\)-jet from initial/final state radiation.

The dashed histograms in the \(t\overline{t}H\) signal plots represent the \(b\overline{b}\) combinations from Higgs decay, which unfortunately turn out in all cases to be only between 30% and 40% of the total event rate observed in the mass window, \(60~{}<~{}m_{b\overline{b}}~{}<100~{}{\rm GeV}\).

This table clearly demonstrates the sensitivity of the \(b\)-tagging performance to the \(t\overline{t}H\) signal.

that the identification of all four \(b\)-jets is too expensive in terms of signal rate, even for a probably much too optimistic \(b\)-tagging efficiency of 70%. On the other hand, for the more standard values, \(\epsilon_{b}=30\%\) and \(R=100\), the expected signal significance of 0.8 for three tagged \(b\)-jets is very similar to that of the \(WH\) channel. The signal rate is however a factor of \(\sim 2\) smaller, with 2l combinations in the mass window (of which only 7 from \(H\to b\overline{b}\) decay) for \(t\bar{t}H\) compared to 40 \(b\overline{b}\) pairs for \(WH\).

Table 19 also shows that the rejection of non-\(b\) jets should be better than \(\sim 50\) in order not to be swamped by the background. Table 20 further shows that the significance of the \(t\bar{t}H\) signal depends also to some extent on the rejection of \(c\)-jets. Again a rejection of \(c\)-jets of at least \(\sim 20\) is needed in order to keep the background under control.

The results are shown for procedure (1) and for the \(b\)-tagging performances described in the text._For \(m_{H}=80\), 100 and 120 GeV, tables 21 and 22 display the expected rates and significances for procedures (2) and (3). There is very little improvement in significance over the naive procedure (1), but procedure (3) does yield a larger fraction (\(\sim 60\%\)) of \(b\overline{b}\) pairs from \(H\to b\overline{b}\) decay in the mass window than procedures (1) and (2), for which this fraction is only \(\sim 35\%\). This means that procedure (3) will rely less heavily on an accurate Monte-Carlo description of the expected shape of the \(b\overline{b}\) mass distribution for both signal and background.

## 7 Conclusions

We have presented here the results of a detailed study of associated Standard Model Higgs production (\(WH\) and \(t\overline{t}H\)), where the Higgs boson decays to \(b\overline{b}\) pairs, which corresponds to the dominant Higgs boson decay mode in the mass range \(80~{}<~{}m_{H}~{}<130\) GeV.

The final states are quite complex and the reconstruction and tagging of \(b\)-jets with high efficiency is obviously a crucial element in the detector performance in the search for such a decay channel. Even for optimistic \(b\)-tagging performances, \(\epsilon_{b}=50\%\) and \(R~{}=~{}50\), the signal cannot be cleanly extracted from the background. This would be even more the case of associated SUSY Higgs production, which in the framework of the MSSM is at best similar in rate to the Standard Model case, but is strongly suppressed for large values of tan\(\beta\).

The results are shown for procedure (1) and for \(\epsilon_{b}\) = 30% and \(R~{}=~{}100\)._For an integrated luminosity of \(10^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\) and \(m_{H}=100\) GeV, we expect at best \(\sim 110\) reconstructed \(H\to b\overline{b}\) decays from \(WH\) production, above a resonant background of \(\sim 150\)\(WZ\) events and a non-resonant background of \(\sim 4800\) events, and \(\sim 100\) reconstructed \(b\overline{b}\) pairs (of which \(\sim 50\) from \(H\to b\overline{b}\) decay) from \(t\overline{t}H\) production, above a background of \(\sim 4000\) events. The main difficulty in extracting these two channels is obviously in the low rate, the need for accurate control of all the background sources and for extremely good \(b\)-tagging performance. It is interesting to note that, beyond these common features, the two signal channels could be quite complementary to each other and also to other possible channels in this mass range, i.e. \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(WH\), with \(H\to\gamma\gamma\).

The results are shown for procedure (2) and for the first two b-tagging performances described in the text._The reasons for this complementarity are:

\(\bullet\) No single channel emerges as a clean signature for the Higgs boson in this mass range, especially if \(m_{H}\sim m_{Z}\) (in many SUSY models, this is possibly the most likely scenario);

\(\bullet\) The \(t\bar{t}H\) channel is the only one that does not have to contend with background from the \(Z\)-resonance, due to the very small value of the \(t\bar{t}Z\) cross-section with respect to the \(t\bar{t}H\) cross-section for \(m_{H}=m_{Z}\). On the other hand it is plagued by combinatorial background from the large multiplicity of \(b\)-quarks present in the final state;

\(\bullet\) After a few years of running at low luminosity, it is quite possible that the combination of these four channels could lead to convincing evidence for a Higgs signal if it were there;

\(\bullet\) The \(H\to b\bar{b}\) channels are unlikely to be accessible as easily at high luminosity as at the initial low luminosity, since the lepton trigger threshold and the jet \(p_{T}\)-threshold would certainly have to be raised in order to cope with the increased trigger rates

The results are shown for procedure (3) and for the first two b-tagging performances described in the text._and with pile-up background. On the other hand, the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) channels are difficult to extract at low luminosity because of the small branching ratio and low signal to background ratio, but certainly the quality of the signal extraction depends less crucially on the luminosity than for the \(H\to b\overline{b}\) case.

From the results of these studies, it seems clear that these channels should be used as important benchmarks to optimise and evaluate as carefully as possible the ATLAS \(b\)-tagging performance. The \(H\to b\overline{b}\) channel at low to intermediate luminosities may be the best way to probe the region \(80\;<\;m_{H}\;<\;100\;\mathrm{GeV}\), whereas the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) channel at high luminosity is better for \(100\;<\;m_{H}\;<\;150\;\mathrm{GeV}\).
