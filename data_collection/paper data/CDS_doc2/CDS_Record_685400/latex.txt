Abstract

In this document we report the results from a high rate photon irradiation test of an 8-plane TRT endcap sector prototype with 192 straws instrumented with final front-end electronics. Data was taken at the Weizmann Institute irradiation facility in Israel, with a Gammabeam 150 \({}^{60}\)Co photon source. Results on the performance of the straws are presented in terms of occupancies and noise rates at high cointing rates, cross-talk studies between straws, and test pulse hit efficiencies under irradiation. The data is compared with a previous irradiation test at the X5 GIF facility at CERN.

The straw tubes of the ATLAS TRT detector will suffer a high irradiation rate from charged particles, neutrons and photons at the LHC design luminosity of 10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) sec\({}^{-1}\). The charged particle counting rate has been estimated to be between 5 and 15 MHz in the endcap region of the TRT [1], depending on the position of the straw with respect to the interaction point. In this note we report the results from a photon irradiation test on a TRT endcap sector prototype instrumented with final front-end electronics. Studies on the performance of the straws at counting rates of up to 20 MHz are presented in terms of global occupancies, cross-talk between straws, and hit registration efficiencies at high counting rates.

## 1) The Weizmann Institute Gamma Irradiation Facility

The Weizmann Institute irradiation facility consists of a Gammabeam 150 \({}^{60}\)Co source manufactured by MDS Nordon Inc [2]. The \({}^{60}\)Co source emits photons of 1173 keV and 1333 keV. The unit consists of a source drawer moving vertically through the center of a cylindrical main shield. With the drawer in the lower vertical position the source is in the center of the main shield. When the drawer is raised the source gets fully exposed above the unit. Source drawer elevation is by means of a simple motorized pully-cable drive.

The Gammabeam 150 \({}^{60}\)Co emits a radiation beam 2 inches (5.08 cm) depth at the cylindrical surface of the source, through a 360 degree horizontal arc, and confined to a 257 degree spherical zone above the top of the surface of the sourcehead.

## 2) Experimental Setup and DAQ

The experimental setup consists of a TRT sector prototype of an endcap wheel of type A (1/32 of \(\oplus\)) used for test beam measurements and also used at the July 2001 CERN GIF irradiation test [3].

The sector prototype contains 8 planes of 24 fully instrumented straws (192 total straws). Each straw is 39 cm long with a 4 mm diameter. The sector prototype was surrounded by an aluminum filter of \(\sim\)1 mm thickness in order to absorb the gamma rays. Pictures of the sector prototype as well as a description of the front-end and back-end electronics are shown in Reference [3]. All results reported in this paper have been obtained for the DMILL 99 version of the DTMROC and ASDBLR chips.

A schematic representation of the flex-rigid board is shown in Figure 1. The picture shows a top view of the board with the grouping of the 192 straws of the sector prototype. Half of the straws (96) share the same web board. A group of 16 straws are readout by a single DTMROC chip, which connects to 2 ASDBLR chips. 8 straws readout through an ASDBLR chip share the same HV group.

One web flap in the sector prototype has a special configuration of connected channels with analog control for gain calibration and signal monitoring.

The sector prototype was placed in a shielded room at a variable distance and at variable angles with respect to the Gammabeam 150 \({}^{60}\)Co source. Figure 2 shows the different experimental data taking conditions used for these measurements. We will refer to them as setups (a) to (g). They lead to different background counting rates and background energy spectrums studied in the next sections. Data was taken with random internal triggers at 40 MHz with the XTRT program [4] specifically design for system tests.

The active gas in the straws was a mixture of 70% Xe, 20% CF\({}_{4}\), and 10% CO\({}_{2}\). The sector prototype was operated at a gas flow of 0.08 cm\({}^{3}\)/min per straw, which corresponds to about one volume per hour as foreseen for final operation at LHC.

### 2.1) Calibrations

Each channel of the flex-rigid board used in these measurements (flex-rigid board #8) was calibrated using the calibration setup described in [3]. Each channel is characterized with a gain and offset for both the low threshold and high threshold DAC's. Figure 3 shows the distribution of gains (in DAC/eV) and DAC offsets for all working channels of the flex-rigid board used in these measurements. These calibration constants are given for both the low and high thresholds of all working channels. For comparison, Figure 4 shows the same distributions for the flex-board used at the CERN GIF irradiation test [3].

During data taking we used these calibrations to set the low and high threshold DAC's of all channels in eV's.

### 2.2) Noise Occupancies and Rates

All results shown in this note in terms of occupancies and counting rates are calculated always from data. We define the occupancies as:

1. **Low threshold occupancies**: the ratio of events with at least one low threshold bit set over the total number of events.
2. **Leading edge occupancies**: ratio of events with at least one leading edge present over the total number of events.
3. **High threshold occupancies**: ratio of events with at least on high threshold bit set over the total number of events.

All occupancies and rates are calculated for either 3 or 1 beam crossings and the counting rates estimated directly from the occupancies

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:4]

At low counting rates, the rates measured from the data are higher than the measured with the monitoring straw due to a low threshold cross-talk seen in the data from high threshold hits (this cross-talk is not seen in the monitoring straw because straws near it are disconnected).
* At high counting rates, the rates measured with the monitoring straw are higher than the rates measured from the data due to overlapping signals not considered when calculating the leading edge occupancies in the data.

Figure 6 shows the leading edge and high threshold occupancies as a function of background counting rate as measured with the data. All occupancies are calculated for 1 beam crossing and are shown for a nominal low threshold of 250 eV and a high threshold of 3 keV. For comparison the results from the CERN GIF irradiation test are also shown.

In the following, all results are presented in terms of background counting rates as measured with the monitoring straw (third column in Table 3).

Figure 7 shows the low threshold, leading edge, and high threshold hit occupancy distributions for a 250 eV low threshold and a 3 keV high threshold. They correspond to a particular experimental setup where the sector prototype was placed away from direct hits from the source and lead to a background counting rate of 0.5 MHz as measured with the monitoring straw (setup (a) in Figure 2). Figure 8 shows these occupancies as a function of channel number. All values are calculated for 1 beam crossing.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**LE Occupancy** & **HT Occupancy** & **Rate in** & \\
**Rate (MHz)** & **Rate (MHz)** & **Monitoring** & **Experimental** \\
**LT = 250 eV** & **HT = 3 keV** & **Straw (MHz)** & **Setup (Figure 2)** \\ \hline
1.4 \(\pm\) 0.8 & 1.0 \(\pm\) 0.2 & 0.5 & (a) \\ \hline
2.4 \(\pm\) 1.2 & 1.6 \(\pm\) 0.2 & 1.0 & (b) \\ \hline

The third column shows the rates (MHz) as measured with an oscilloscope for a single monitoring straw.

## 4) Background Spectrum

The different experimental conditions (Figure 2) used for data taking lead to different energy spectrums reaching the sector prototype. Hits in the straws come from direct photons from the source, reflected photons from the surrounded walls, and scattered electrons from absorbed photons in the aluminum foil which surrounds the straws and from the walls which surround the sector prototype. In this section we study the integral hit particle spectrums from the straws.

Low and high threshold occupancy scans as a function of threshold represent the integral spectrum shapes for energy hit depositions. These are shown in Figures 9, 10 and 11 for the different background counting rates. The distributions from Figures 9 to 11 suggest a harder energy deposition spectrum shape from high threshold hits for the situations where the sector prototype was placed far away from the photon source and with material in between. This harder energy spectrum is correlated with the higher low threshold occupancies at low thresholds which is due to cross-talk from high threshold hits.

### 4.1) _Comparison with Test Beam Data_

In this Section we compare the differential dE/dx distribution and integral energy spectrum shapes from the H8 test-beam with the shapes measured at the Weizmann irradiation test. The test-beam data was taken with 20 GeV electrons and 20 GeV pions on a TRT sector prototype with transition radiation material in between the straws. Figures 12 and 13 show the dE/dx and the integral energy spectrums for the 20 GeV electrons and 20 GeV pions test-beam data, repectively.

To compare the integral shapes measured at the Weizmann irradiation test with those shown in Figures 12 and 13 we calculate the ratio between high threshold hit occupancies and low threshold hit occupancies as a function of the high threshold and for a fixed low threshold value. This is shown in Figure 14 for a low threshold of 250 eV and in Figure 15 for a low threshold of 300 eV. The four plots correspond to different experimental setups. Occupancies are always calculated for 3 beam crossings.

All curves in Figure 14 for different background counting rates indicate the presence of large energy depositions in the data taken at Weizmann when compared to the test-beam data, especially for the 20 GeV test-beam pion MIP data. The energy spectrums taken at higher counting rates (2.7 and 4.7 MHz) are, on the other hand, software than those taken at lower rates (0.5 and 1.0 MHz).

### 4.2) _Signal Width_

Signal width distributions for different background counting rates are shown in Figures 16 and 17 for two different low threshold settings (250 eV and 600 eV) respectively. The signal width distributions are calculated for leading edge hits well contained in a 3 beam crossing interval (both the leading edge and the trailing edge of the signal contained in the time window) and are defined as the time width between the leading edge and the trailing edge of the signal.

The distributions shown in Figures 16 and 17 show a different relative contribution from noise and particle hits due to the the different low threshold settings

### 5) Cross-Talk Studies

Occupancy cross-talk has been studied in the same way as described in the GIF irradiation test note [3].

### 5.1) _Sources of Cross-Talk_

There are two main sources of cross-talk between the straws. First, straws which share the same decoupling capacitor suffer conductive coupling on their signal return (see Figure 4 in [3]). Second, although the straw wall surrounds its wire all over the length of the straw, it is still possible an exposure to the environment at the end of the straw (parasitic capacitive coupling). As 8 straws are connected to a common HV capacitor, one straw will see the cross-talk of the other 7 straws, mainly conductive, when they are fired.

The internal channel-to-channel cross-talk of the analog read-out ASDBLR chip is by design less than 0.5%. Finally, the connecting traces on the flex-rigid board as well as the web boards which serve the signals from the straws to the front-end electronics may also contribute to the detected straw-to-straw cross-talk.

The effective cross-talk is a superposition of all mentioned coupling paths. Measurements and calculations [5] suggest amplitude cross-talk in the percentage region, but the final cross-talk can reach a manifold of these results.

### 5.2) _Occupancy Correlation Matrix_

The occupancy correlation matrix provides the most detailed information on the correlation between signals from different channels (see [3] and references therein). This correlation indicates the presence of common mode noise or cross-talk between channels. Figure 18 shows the correlation matrix for a single DTMROC chip (16 channels, 2 ASDBLR chips) for two different background counting rate conditions (0.5 MHz and 2.7 MHz). The band structures around the diagonal indicate the presence of cross-talk between channels from two ASDBLR HV groups.

### 5.3) _Occupancy Cross-Talk Measurements_

The occupancy cross-talk is studied by calculating occupancies for 3 different sets of straws and for events where only one particular straw is required to contain a hit (at least one high threshold bit set out of the 3 beam crossings). We will refer to this straw as the _trigger straw_. For these events we consider then the average occupancies for the following set of straws:* 7 straws sharing the same HV group as the _trigger straw_.
* 24 straws (from 2 DTMROC chips) sharing the same web flap as the _trigger straw_ (not included are those straws sharing the same HV group as the _trigger straw_).
* 64 straws from 4 DTMROC chips placed in different web flaps as the _trigger straw_. We will refer to these straws as _away straws_.

In all cases we consider only channels not suspected of bad behavior (dead or noisy channels). The situation is illustrated in Figure 19, where 4 DTMROC chips are shown, including one with the _trigger straw_, one sharing the same web flap as the _trigger straw_, and 2 away DTMROC chips placed on different web flaps as the _trigger straw_.

### Low Threshold Occupancy Cross-Talk

Figures 20, 22 and 24 show the low threshold occupancies as a function of the low threshold for the above defined 3 sets of straws and for different background counting rates (0.5, 1.0 and 2.7 MHz, respectively). From these Figures the only significant low threshold occupancy cross-talk observed appears for those straws which share the same HV group as the _trigger straw_. No low threshold occupancy cross-talk is observed for the other set of straws. The measurements done at 0.5 and 1.0 MHz show higher cross-talk levels than those obtained at 2.7 MHz. This is mainly due to the different background energy spectrums at these different counting rates (see Section 4).

In all cases, the low threshold occupancy cross-talk increases with the high threshold set on the _trigger straw_. This can be seen in Figures 21, 23 and 25 for different background counting rates (0.5, 1.0 and 2.7 MHz, respectively).

For the 0.5 MHz data, the absolute increase in the low threshold occupancies from high threshold hits cross-talk lies between an 11% to 20% from high threshold hits between 5 keV and 11 keV, respectively, and for a 250 eV low threshold. The cross-talk occupancy increase for the 2.7 MHz data lies between a 5% to 10% for high threshold hits between 3 keV and 11 keV, respectively.

The difference in the occupancy cross-talk observed at low and high rates is due to the presence of a harder energy spectrum for the high counting rate data taking conditions with respect to the low rate data (see Section 4).

### High Threshold Occupancy Cross-Talk

No significant high threshold occupancy cross-talk from high threshold hits is observed in any of the measurements. This can be seen in Figure 26, where the high threshold occupancy as a function of the high threshold settings is shown for two groups of straws: straws sharing the same HV group as the _trigger straw_, and _away straws_.

## 6) Signal Hit Efficiencies

Signal hit detection efficiencies have been measured as a function of background counting rate with calibrated internal test pulses. The hit detection efficiency for a particular channel is defined as the fraction of events with a leading edge hit over the total number of events. A leading edge is always defined as a low to high transition. The internal test pulse signals are adjusted in time to arrive always at the same position at the middle beam crossing.

Two different test pulse signals of 15 and 21 DAC's (internal test pulse amplitude DAC) are sent to all channels of all chips. They have been calibrated to provide signals of 600 eV and 1000 eV, respectively1.

Footnote 1: 15 and 21 test pulse DAC’s provide a mean hit occupancy of 50% for low thresholds of 600 eV and 1000 eV, respectively.

Figure 27 shows the leading edge position distribution in time for a 600 eV test pulse signal when no irradiation is present and for different background counting rates.

The signal hit efficiencies for different low threshold settings and for the two different test pulses (600 eV and 1000 eV) are shown in Figure 28 as a function of the background counting rate. The same distributions but as a function of low threshold are shown in Figure 29. All values shown correspond to the efficiencies for a single straw (binomial errors).

The effect of amplitude pile-up at high rates translates into a decrease of signal efficiency. For a nominal threshold of 250 eV the hit efficiencies decrease from 99.6% to 82.8% at 4.7 MHz counting rates, and from 99.6% to 58.1% at 9.4 MHz for 600 eV signals. For 1000 eV signals the hit efficiencies decrease from 100% to 89.8% at 4.7 MHz and from 100% to 69.7% at 9.4 MHz.

### 6.1) _Leading Edge Time Occupancies_

The signal hit efficiencies are highly correlated with the leading edge time occupancies. These time occupancies are defined as the ratio between time occupied by leading edges during 3 beam crossings over total time in 3 beam crossings (75 ns).

Figure 30 shows the time occupancies as a function of the background counting rate for different low thresholds. Table 4 summarizes the results of hit efficiencies and leading edge time occupancies for a low threshold of 250 eV as a function of background counting rate.
