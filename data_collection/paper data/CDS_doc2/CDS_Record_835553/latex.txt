## 1 Introduction

In past years, a roughly 1/8 of modules of hadronic calorimeter Tilecal ([1]) was calibrated at CERN SPS testbeams. Majority of calibrated modules was also exposed to 180 GeV muon beams under eta-projective geometry, which corresponds to Tilecal geometry inside ATLAS detector at the pit. A summary of analysis of Tilecal modules response to 180 GeV eta-projective muon testbeams is shown here together with results of GEANT4 ([2]) testbeam simulation.

In case of both real and simulated data, the muon spectra was fitted by Gauss-Landau convolution ([3]) and the most probable value (MOP) of this spectra was used to represent the tested module response for given value of pseudorapidity \(\eta\).

## 2 Muon Path Lengths

With a simplifying assumption, 180 GeV muon energy loss is dominated by ionization and mean value of this loss is (at a scale of few meters of iron Tilecal consists of) proportional to muon pathlength through calorimeter1. Position of tested modules towards the testbeam was chosen to let the beam pass through a centre of Tilecal module substructures - towers. Muon pathlength through towers changes with pseudorapidity. In order to compare responses of different towers it is suitable to normalize them to some length unit. Natural choice of such a unit in case of Tilecal is a period of its sampling structure (1 period = 18 mm).

Footnote 1: It is fair to note here, that MOP itself does not scale entirely linearly with muon pathlengths, nevertheless it is still a valuable parameter for characterizing module response. For other approaches using truncated mean and numerical truncated mean see [9] and [10], respectively. The numerical truncated mean method gives uniformity of response of all tested Tilecal towers 2.2 % (better than MOP), but neither in this method the signal nonlinearity on muon pathlength is completely solved. The truncated mean method was used only for 90 deg muon runs, as its application to eta-projective muon runs was not as successful as expected.

To be punctual, one should calculate muon pathlength as a sum of pathlengths of muon through Tilecal active medium - scintillators, but it would require high precision knowledge of mutual position of beam particle and module. Instead, as a satysfying approach, muon pathlength is calculated as an expected pathlength of muon through a minimal volume bordered by scintillators (that _excludes_ all inner- and end-plates, girders, last row of spacers behind tilerow 11, etc.). Final values of muon pathlengths used in this note are presented in Table 1.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c c} \hline Pseudorapidity (\(\eta\)) & 0.05 & 0.15 & 0.25 & 0.35 & 0.45 & 0.55 & 0.65 & 0.75 & 0.85 \\ Pathlength (mm) & 1521 & 1536 & 1567 & 1613 & 1675 & 1755 & 1851 & 1431 & 870 \\ \hline Pseudorapidity (\(\eta\)) & 0.95 & 1.05 & 1.15 & 1.25 & 1.35 & 1.45 & & & \\ Pathlength (mm) & 1026 & 1604 & 2313 & 2836 & 2233 & 1627 & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Muon Eta-Scans

The muon energy spectra was obtained using Fit method ([4]), cuts for size of beam spot (ximp, yimp) were used. In case of \(\eta=\pm 0.05\) a special treatment of muon spectra had to be done due to so-called channelling effect2 ([7]).

Footnote 2: Under such low values of \(\eta\) muons can “see” periodic sampling structure of Tilecal modules and obtained muon energy spectrum does not follow the Gauss–Landau convolution shape. In order to recover this shape (and obtain MOP also for this value of \(\eta\)) the energy is weighted by its impact point dependance.

For each measured pseudorapidity a mean value of MOPs over all modules (tested under this pseudorapidity) is presented in Table 2 and, pathlength normalized, in Fig.1. Mean muon response of each module is shown in Table 3. To sum up, overall mean value of pathlength normalized MOPs is 24.07 fC/period, uniformity of all tested towers is 2.72 %3.

Footnote 3: This uniformity is of course also influenced by a nonlinearity of MOP depending on muon pathlength. One can assume, that using another linear method would give the overall tower uniformity value closer to the average uniformity of towers of a given pseudorapidity, that is about 2 % (see [10]).

## 4 Comparison with Monte Carlo

lowing formula:

\[E_{MC}=\frac{e}{\mu}E_{sci}s_{em}, \tag{1}\]

where \(E_{sci}\) is energy deposited by muons in scintillators of all summed cells, \(\frac{e}{\mu}\) is a factor taking into account specific way of muon energy deposition. Value of this factor for 180 GeV muons was interpolated from values presented in [5]. Finally, \(s_{em}\) is a ratio of electron total loss of energy 4 over electron loss of energy in scintillators. 180 GeV eta-projective simulated electron samples taken also in the directory above were used for this purpose. In our case, \(\frac{e}{\mu}=0.939\) and \(s_{em}=36.8\).

Footnote 4: In terms of variables used in simulated samples, this means _Esci+Einner._

Energy reconstructed from testbeam data is calculated according following formula, presented in [5]:

\[E_{\mu}=\frac{e}{\mu}\frac{Q_{\mu}}{\alpha_{e}}, \tag{2}\]

where \(Q_{\mu}\) is measured charge corresponding to muon energy losses, \(\alpha_{e}\) (pC/GeV) is an electromagnetic scale conversion factor, here \(\alpha_{e}=1.008\) pC/GeV (for Fit method), as taken from [6].

In Fig.2 a comparison of Tilecal response to 180 GeV eta-projective testbeam muons and their simulated counterparts is presented. Relative differences of data and simulation, also shown in this Figure, do not depend on \(\frac{e}{\mu}\). In average, simulated data lies 1.7% above real data, with standard deviation of 3.2%. At this moment, such a result can be considered as satisfactory. Nevertheless, values of \(\alpha_{e}\) and \(s_{em}\) might later be refined (e.g. more test beam samples might be used).

## 5 Summary

As shown, the uniformity of response of all tested Tilecal towers to eta-projective 180 GeV muons is 2.72% using Fit Method and pathlength normalized MOPs. Also comparison of data and MC simulation gives satisfactory results. In absolute values the MC simulation lies in average only 1.7% above the data, with a spread of relative differences of about 3.2%.
