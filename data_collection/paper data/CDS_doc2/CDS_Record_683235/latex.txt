The present note should be followed by a more complete one, to be published after all major dimensions are frozen.

## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS Collaboration undertook a descoping exercise at the end of 1995 in order to create some contingency for the construction of the detector. In the same exercise also the overall dimensions were reduced in order to fit better into the envisaged underground area. The dimensions given below were agreed upon in the ATLAS Executive Board (EB) and in the Collaboration Board (CB) meetings of December 1995.

Some detailed dimensions were left open for further study and to be settled in the EB meeting of 26.1.96. These were the longitudinal extension of the shielding and the neighbouring EI muon chamber, and the inner bore and outer radius of theEnd-cap Toroids (ECT) which were to be optimised by the muon group considering the best ECT-Barrel Toroid (BT) transition and taking radiation shielding vs. acceptance into account.

The EB and CB stressed as most important dimensions the outer overall radius of the ATLAS detector supposed to stay within 11 m in the major part of the experiment, and the half length of the detector not to exceed 23 m.

In the meantime also, the last open point has been settled, namely the outer radius of the barrel toroid and the new "inverted" layout of the barrel muon detector. This decision was taken in the CB on 08.03.96.

## 2 Dimension Milestone Summary

### Definition of the envelope of a subsystem

A more precise meaning of the notion "envelope" is explained in revised Fig. 1.

A "boundary zone" inside the envelope, accounting for essentially all subsystem specific and internal tolerances and clearances, is first defined. The envelope should then include manufacturing tolerances and other general features. All deformations of any part, even in a fault/abnormal situation, are also to be included. Then, an "interval zone" between two subsystems \(\hat{\imath}\) defined, which cor::in s external tolerances and clearances. Local features, such as safety valves, will need separate attention.

The boundary zone is managed by the subsystem and monitored by the Technical Co-ordination (TIE -- Team for Integration and Engineering), whereas the interval zone is managed by the Technical Co-ordination, in close collaboration with the adjacent subsystems. Services and supports are considered as subsystems in this respect, and receive special attention from the Technical Co-ordination.

### Present status of dimensions (release 0.6.1)

In the following, the dimensions discussed are enumerated. These numbers fix the global envelopes of almost all subsystems of ATLAS. In the hierarchy of dimensions to be fixed however, the global outer radius and the global overall length of the detector play the most important role.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Longitudinal dimensions} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{(mm)} \\ \hline \hline Inner cavity & 2 * 3400 \\ \hline Crack between the LArg cryostats & 100 \\ \hline LArg end-cap cryostat & 3165 \\ \hline Shielding and EI muon chambers & 965 \\ \hline End-cap toroids & 5000 \\ \hline Barrel toroid & 2 * 12630 \\ \hline EO muon chambers, overall & 22850 from X \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The above dimensions are also repeated in more detail in the revised attached Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, showing the transverse and longitudinal views of ATLAS in the cavern respectively. These drawings are available on the Web ([http://atlasinfo.cern.ch/Atlas/TIE/integration/parameters.html](http://atlasinfo.cern.ch/Atlas/TIE/integration/parameters.html)).

The TO muon chamber radius is shown in the longitudinal view to be 12150 mm and exceeding the 11m main transverse size envisaged. This radius was chosen for complete acceptance and greatest ease of installation of the TO chambers. Further studies with respect to the cavern and installation procedures are in progress.

Concerning the overlap area of BT and ECT, it has to be noted that the design of the force transfer between the toroids is not achieved. Furthermore, for the ECT cryostat design, there are three different options in consideration (see detail left bottom in Fig. 3).

The favoured number of "voussoirs" of 8 for the BT seems possible, but is not formally decided yet. This determines also the number of feet of the general support system (rail system).

## 3 Conclusion

The ATLAS detector was reduced in overall size to fit more easily into the existing space at point 1 of LHC.

The principal dimensions of almost all subsystems were fixed. Detailed design towards the TDR's can now proceed without further delay.
