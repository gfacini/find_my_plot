**Higgs Pair Production in the \(H(\to\tau\tau)H(\to b\bar{b})\) channel at the High-Luminosity LHC**

The ATLAS Collaboration

Prospects studies are presented for the observation of double Higgs production in the channel \(H(\to b\bar{b})H(\to\tau\tau)\) for a total integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(\sqrt{s}\) =14 TeV proton-proton collisions at the HL-LHC. A cut-based analysis strategy using MC data and a parametrisation of the ATLAS detector provide assessment to the measurement prospects performed under different assumptions for the Higgs trilinear self-coupling values. Assuming SM background and SM signal, we expect to set an upper limit of the cross section for the di-Higgs production of \(4.3\times\sigma(HH\to b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-})\) at 95% Confidence Level. Using an effective Lagrangian for the Higgs potential, and allowing its trilinear self-coupling to vary, we can project an exclusion of \(\lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{SM}\leq-4\) and \(\lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{SM}\geq 12\).

## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have reported the discovery of a particle at a mass of \(m_{H}\simeq 125\) GeV [1; 2; 3], consistent with the Standard Model Higgs Boson (\(H\)). In order to test the correctness of the Standard Model and establish whether the Higgs mechanism is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking, the measurement of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling and subsequent reconstruction of the Higgs potential is crucial.

A direct measurement of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling \(\lambda_{HHH}\) can be done via the study of Higgs boson pair production. At hadron colliders, the dominant production mechanism is gluon fusion, with the other production mechanisms: Vector Boson Fusion, Higgsstrahlung, and Associated Production with \(t\bar{t}\), being more than an order of magnitude smaller [4; 5; 6]. For centre-of-mass energies of 14 TeV, the production cross section of pairs of 125 GeV Higgs bosons is estimated to be 40.8 fb (with an error of \(\pm 8.5\%\) from QCD scale uncertainties, and \(\pm 7\%\) from PDF+\(\alpha_{S}\) uncertainties) [7; 8].

Albeit the possibility of measuring the Higgs trilinear self-coupling via Higgs pair production at the LHC has been analyzed by several studies [9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17], the signal measurement poses a challenge. One conclusion is that a large dataset is needed to be sensitive to the Higgs trilinear self-coupling in the Standard Model, because of the smallness of the signal rates and the large backgrounds [18]. Moreover, given the order of magnitude of the cross section this is an ideal measurement to be assessed in the context of the proposed High Luminosity upgrade of the LHC, which is planned to take place after the completion of the collision program of the current accelerator. The so-called HL-LHC will provide 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=\)14 TeV.

The various decays of the Standard Model Higgs boson offer a variety of final states which can be studied, and the most interesting of these are given in Table 1, alongside their branching ratios and the approximate event yield in the anticipated full HL-LHC dataset.

In this note we present a cut-based analysis for one of the most promising double Higgs boson decay channels according to Table 1, in which one of the Higgs bosons decays into a pair of \(b-\)quarks while the other one decays into a pair of \(\tau\) leptons. The larger branching ratio of the \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) decay, when compared to \(H\to\gamma\gamma\), results in a significantly larger total yield in comparison with the case already discussed in Ref. [19]. Albeit in our case, a more complex final state and larger backgrounds make the determination of the signal yield (and strength) more challenging, the combination of the different

sub-channels may provide a confirmation of double Higgs production, and perhaps shed some light on the size of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling \(\lambda_{HHH}\).

In order to assess the measurement prospects in each of these channels, _'truth-level'_ studies have been performed, with signal and background samples produced using a variety of event generators. The high-luminosity conditions provide a challenging experimental environment, which will be mitigated as much as possible by improvements on the ATLAS detector design and technology, as described in Ref. [20]. The use of fully simulated samples for the signal and each of the background processes is unfeasible at this point in terms of time, due to the large time and CPU overheads for producing datasets of a sufficient size under full HL-LHC conditions, with an average number of collisions per bunch crossing of \(\langle\mu\rangle=140\). Therefore, a number of representative samples were produced and used to extract parametrisations of various aspects of the detector performance under such conditions, as described in Refs. [21, 22]. These were applied to the truth-level samples produced by the event generators in order to model the expected performance of the upgraded ATLAS detector at HL-LHC.

The final results of this prospects analysis are expressed as significance of the presence of double-Higgs boson production with respect to the background only.

## 2 The \(HH\to bb\tau\tau\) measurement

The measurement of this final state has been divided into three different sub-channels depending on the decay mode of the \(\tau\) leptons: \(\tau_{\rm lep}\tau_{\rm lep}\), \(\tau_{\rm lep}\tau_{\rm had}\) and \(\tau_{\rm had}\tau_{\rm had}\), where \(\tau_{\rm lep}\) means a \(\tau\) which decays into a \(\mu\) or \(e\) lepton plus a pair of neutrinos and \(\tau_{\rm had}\) represents a tau decaying into a \(\nu_{\tau}\) plus hadrons. Each of these sub-channels has been analysed independently, since they are conditioned to the reconstruction of orthogonal final states for which different trigger requirements apply, besides being affected by different background processes.

There are common irreducible backgrounds for all these sub-channels, and amongst them one can list: \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Z(\tau\tau)\)+jets, \(t\bar{t}\) being the most significant. One can also add the contribution of diboson production: \(ZZ\), \(ZH\) or \(WZ\) besides other backgrounds that affect only a specific sub-channel. The \(Z(bb)\)+jets background is small and it has been neglected. More details on the backgrounds will follow in Section 4.

A cut-based analysis has been performed for each sub-channel with the primary objective to observe Higgs pair production, with optimisation for the significance for signal \(S\) over background \(B\) events, as \(S/\sqrt{B}\). Each sub-channel is treated separately with dedicated pre-selection criteria and set of cuts, in order to improve the significance.

The effect of additional jets (sometimes identified as \(b\)-jets or hadronic taus) produced by pile-up interactions is also taken into account. This is achieved by embedding in the signal and background events a random distribution of jets, generated by extrapolating the 8 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) observed pile-up distributions to the HL-LHC energy and conditions. The track confirmation method is used to suppress jets arising from pile-up interactions [23].

## 3 Objects definitions

In this study, particle information at the generator level for signal and background processes is used. In order to obtain realistic results, the generator outputs are smeared with parametrisations of the expected performance of the ATLAS detectors which are based on full simulations under the HL-LHC operation conditions [21, 22].

Electrons and muons are taken directly from the generator output with their \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) smeared and their reconstruction efficiencies taken from the parametrisations in Ref. [21] and Ref. [22], respectively.

For electrons, the crack calorimeter region (\(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\)) is excluded, with electrons being reconstructed in the whole inner detector extension (\(|\eta|<2.5\)). The probability of a jet faking an electron is taken into account, and the parametrisation for this effect follows the recommendations from Ref. [21]. For muons, the region \(|\eta|<2.4\) is considered.

Electrons and muons are in addition required to be isolated from other possible energy deposits in the calorimeters. This requirement is accomplished at the generator level by summing up the energy of all stable particles with the exception of neutrinos within \(\Delta R(\ell,\mathrm{particle})<0.2\), and requiring this sum to be less than 10 GeV.

Tau leptons decaying into hadrons are reconstructed by looking at their decay products stored in the generator output and summing up the 4-vectors of all visible particles (excluding neutrinos). The detection efficiency and the probability of a jet faking a hadronic tau is parametrised as in Ref. [21] depending on the hadronic tau decay mode (single or multi prong), as it is done in real data. For leptonically decaying taus, no special treatment is applied, so that the leptons are reconstructed following the procedure mentioned in the previous paragraph.

Particle-level jets are reconstructed using the \(anti-k_{t}\) algorithm with the parameter \(R=0.4\)[24]. Once reconstructed, their four-momenta are smeared according to the resolution function given in Ref. [22].

Jets are matched to a produced \(b\)-hadron from the generator to identify \(b\)-jets. The \(b\)-hadron state is taken after FSR, which will give its final direction and transverse momentum, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the \(b\)-hadron is required to be greater than 5 GeV. The matching is done between the \(b\)-hadron direction and the jet direction which are required to be within \(\Delta R<0.3\), ensuring that the \(b\)-hadron is well contained inside the jet cone. This matching is only performed on jets within the inner detector acceptance \(|\eta|<2.5\). In order to proceed in the same way as in real data analyses, the \(b\)-tagging efficiency and fake rate parametrisation given in Ref. [22] are used to define the probabilities of keeping a \(b\)-jet, a \(c\)-jet or a light-jet in the \(b\)-tagging procedure. A correction is applied on the \(b\)-jets energy in order to account for out-of-jet-cone radiation and semi-leptonic \(b\)-hadron decays, which causes the \(m_{b\,\bar{b}}\) to peak well below the Higgs mass. For more details, see Ref. [19].

The trigger efficiencies have been estimated by calculating the rates expected at the HL-LHC, which have been obtained by rescaling the Run 1 rates to take into account the expected improved trigger rejection after the detector upgrades envisaged to happen during Phase-I. The offline trigger threshold for single electrons and muons is 25 GeV, and for single taus, 60 GeV. [21, 25].

The missing transverse momentum is calculated at particle-level by summing the transverse momentum of all non-interacting particles in the event and then it is smeared according to the parametrisation given in Ref. [22] as a function of the scalar sum of the final state particles \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), using an expected pile-up level of \(\langle\mu\rangle=140\), which causes a significant broadening of the missing transverse energy distribution.

The final object content in a given event is obtained after removing those which overlap in the detector extension. Jets are removed if they overlap with a selected electron, muon or hadronic tau within \(\Delta R<0.2\). As a next step, hadronic taus are removed if they overlap with selected electrons and muons within \(\Delta R<0.2\). Finally, electrons are removed if they overlap with muons, under the same \(\Delta R<0.2\) criterion.

The Missing Mass Calculator technique [26] is deployed in this analysis to determine the four-momentum of the Higgs boson from its \(\tau\tau\) decay products. This technique allows a more precise determination of the underlying kinematics for resonances which decay into partially invisible final states, when compared to other methods. The method starts from a set of linear equations for the decay products kinematics in the \(\tau\tau\) system and calculates all its possible solutions, weighting them by a likelihood function (extracted from \(Z\to\tau\tau\) Monte Carlo simulations) which is then minimized to obtain the best solution for the system.

## 4 Simulated samples

For the signal, only the dominant gluon-fusion Higgs pair production process has been generated using MadGraph 5 [27] subsequently showered with PYTHIA 8 [28]. Four signal samples have been produced in total, corresponding to different values of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling constant: \(\lambda_{HHH}=\{0,1,2,10\}\times\lambda_{\text{SM}}\) where \(\lambda_{\text{SM}}\) is the Standard Model value, assuming a Higgs mass of 125 GeV. It is important to note that there is an interference between the box and the triangle diagrams in the double Higgs production, and the Higgs trilinear self-coupling \(\lambda_{HHH}\) is only included in the triangle diagram. As a result, if such coupling is zero, the cross section for double Higgs production is expected to be higher than it would be for the Standard Model value of \(\lambda_{HHH}\).

Two \(t\bar{t}\) samples with different final state selections were used: one containing at least one lepton in the final state (produced with POWHEG [29]+ PYTHIA 6 [30]), and one having only fully hadronic final states (orthogonal to the other \(t\bar{t}\) sample and produced with MC@NLO+HERWIG [31]). All \(Z\)+jets and \(W\)+jets samples were produced with the SHERPA [32] event generator. Di-boson samples have been generated as follows. The \(ZZ\) events have been produced with POWHEG+PYTHIA 6, while \(ZH\) and \(WH\) were produced with PYTHIA 8. Single top quark samples in the \(s\) and \(t\)-channels, and in association with a \(W\) boson were generated with POWHEG+PYTHIA 6, with AcerMC [33]+PYTHIA 6, and with POWHEG+PYTHIA 6 respectively. A set of processes of the type \(t\bar{t}+X\) was included in this study as possible background sources, where events with \(X=Z,W,\gamma\) were produced with MadGraph 5, and events with \(X=H\) were generated with PYTHIA 8. The background contribution from single Higgs boson production via gluon fusion decaying into \(ZZ^{*}\) was produced with POWHEG+PYTHIA 6. Dijets events were generated with PYTHIA 8 and \(bbjj\) events were generated with SHERPA. The \(bbH(\tau\tau)\) sample was generated with MadGraph 5 and showered with PYTHIA 8. For all samples generated with PYTHIA 8, the AU2 underlying event tune [34] was used.

## 5 Selection

The signal considered in this analysis includes all double Higgs boson production, while the background includes all SM processes that do not produce two Higgs bosons. Important to note is that the Higgs boson transverse momentum distribution varies as a function of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling constant, \(\lambda_{HHH}\), as can be seen in Ref. [4]. However, a selection requirement is needed in the Higgs transverse momentum to reject the high levels of background in the analysis. The selection procedure depends on the expected \(\tau\) leptons decay products, and has been optimised for signal \(S\) over background \(B\) events, as \(S(\lambda=1\lambda_{\rm SM})/\sqrt{B}\) (other SM without di-Higgs) separately for each final state. A particular selection has been devised for the _had-had_ channel, where both \(\tau\) leptons decay hadronically; for the _lep-had_ channel, where one of the \(\tau\) leptons decays either into an electron or a muon; and for the _lep-lep_ channel. There are small differences in the pre-selection of objects for the three different channels, which are summarized in Table 2.

### \(\tau_{\rm had}\tau_{\rm had}\) channel

For selecting events in this channel, we require the identification of at least two opposite-sign charge (OS) hadronic tau leptons and at least two \(b\)-tagged jets, and we veto events containing isolated electrons or muons.

The online selection of the _had-had_ final state is performed by triggering events with a di-tau candidate. The efficiency of this trigger selection has been studied in the context of the HL-LHC in Ref. [21], giving a 64% selection efficiency plateau with an offline threshold of 40 GeV for the visible transverse momentum of the hadronic taus.

Furthermore, a set of cuts is used to suppress the backgrounds. For this channel we have additional background contributions from \(t\bar{t}\) fully hadronic final states, corresponding to the case in which the \(W\) boson in \(t\to Wb\) decays to \(\bar{q}q^{\prime}\), therefore, we consider separately this class of background events in the analysis. The invariant mass of the two \(b\)-jets with the highest \(p_{\rm T}\), and the MMC-reconstructed invariant mass of the hadronic tau pair, also with the two highest \(p_{\rm T}\) taus, are important observables used to discriminate the signal from the backgrounds. Another pair of important observables are the s-transverse mass, \(m_{\rm T2}\)[35, 36, 37], and the transverse momentum of the \(b\bar{b}\) system, which are used to achieve an optimal \(t\bar{t}\) background rejection. The distributions obtained for the variables just described are shown in Figure 1, on which the signal for \(\lambda_{HHH}=1\times\lambda_{\rm SM}\) is shown in yellow (after rescaling it by 1000), together with the most relevant background contributions. After tuning the cuts to optimise \(S/\sqrt{B}\), we find that the selected events in this channel should fulfill the following requirements:

### \(\tau_{\rm{lep}}\tau_{\rm{lep}}\) channel

Amongst the three sub-channels in the \(\tau\tau\) decay modes, the _lep-lep_ channel represents 12.4% of these decays. For this sub-channel, the analysis has been performed considering all the possible combinations of the final lepton states: electron-electron, muon-muon and electron-muon.

A single lepton trigger is applied soon after the pre-selection stage following the recommendations from Ref. [21, 22], considering a \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold of 25 GeV for electrons and muons as already described in Section 3. For single electrons, the trigger efficiency is 88%, and for single muons, the trigger efficiency is 70% for \(|\eta|<1.05\) and 86% for \(1.05<|\eta|<2.4\). It is important to note however, that events with

The mass of the \(\tau\tau\) system is reconstructed using the Missing Mass Calculator technique [26].

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

### \(\tau_{\rm lep}\tau_{\rm had}\) channel

For this channel, a pre-selection is done so that the final state objects are restricted to have at least one electron or muon, at least two \(b\)-jets and at least one hadronic \(\tau\) lepton, with their definitions given in Section 3. The measured charge of the lepton is also required to be opposite to the tau lepton charge. For this channel, only a single electron or a single muon trigger is applied soon after the pre-selection stage, following the recommendations from Ref. [21, 22], considering a \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold of 25 GeV for electrons

and muons as already described in Section 3. This is due to the fact that the trigger efficiency is very low for the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold of 20 GeV applied for the hadronic taus selection in the \(\tau_{\mathrm{lep}}\)\(\tau_{\mathrm{had}}\) analysis. Afterwards, a set of selection criteria follows this stage to minimise the influence of the backgrounds.

The final \(m_{\tau\tau}\) reconstructed with the two leading \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) taus, using the Missing Mass Calculator method, is required to be within a window around the Higgs mass \(m_{\tau\tau}\in[90\text{ GeV},160\text{ GeV}]\). A similar requirement is applied to the two hardest \(b\)-jet system mass, in order to select primarily \(H\to b\bar{b}\) decays: \(m_{b\bar{b}}\in[90\text{ GeV},140\text{ GeV}]\). Figures 6 and 7 show the mass of the \(\tau\tau\) and \(b\bar{b}\) systems, respectively, after the pre-selection.

A series of cuts has been implemented in order to reduce the contamination from \(t\bar{t}\) events:

1. The sum of the differences in \(\phi\) between the hadronic tau and the missing energy, and between the lepton and the missing energy direction, defined as \(\sum\Delta\phi\), is required to be less than 2.

Figure 6: Mass of the \(\tau\tau\) system reconstructed using the Missing Mass Calculator after pre-selection in the (a) electron channel and (b) muon channel.

Figure 7: Mass of the \(b\bar{b}\) system after pre-selection in the (a) electron channel and (b) muon channel.

2. We also demand that both the two \(b\)-jets and the \(\tau\) leptons reconstructed using the Missing Mass Calculator have similar distances to one another. This is done by selecting events with the value of \(\Delta=|\Delta R(b_{1},b_{2})-\Delta R(\tau_{1},\tau_{2})|<0.5\).
3. The transverse mass of the lepton and the missing transverse momentum, \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\), is defined as in Equation 1. The value of \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\) is expected to be large for \(t\bar{t}\) decays, therefore, in this study, the \(t\bar{t}\) background is reduced by requiring that \(m_{\mathrm{T}}<80\) GeV. \[m_{\mathrm{T}}=\sqrt{2E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}p_{\mathrm{T},\ell}\left[1- \cos(\phi_{\ell}-\phi_{E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}})\right]}.\] (1)
4. A further selection criterion demands the two selected \(b\)-jets to be close to one another: \(\Delta R(b_{1},b_{2})<1.6\).
5. We also use a \(\chi^{2}\) variable for vetoing events that have overall similar kinematics to the \(t\bar{t}\) production. The variable \(\chi^{2}\) is defined as in Equation 2, where the minimum is considered by taking all possible \(b\)-jets and jets permutations. The variable is defined in such a way as to make a kinematic fit of the event jets, assuming the \(W\) boson and the top quark masses in [GeV], and a fractional deviation in the masses. The event is rejected if the value of \(\chi^{2}\geq 10\). Figure 8 shows the distribution of this variable for the signal and the \(t\bar{t}\) background. \[\chi^{2} = \min\left[\left(\frac{m_{b_{1}\tau j}-172.5}{17.25}\right)^{2}+ \left(\frac{m_{b_{2}\ell\nu}-172.5}{17.25}\right)^{2}+\right.\] (2) \[\left.+\left(\frac{m_{\ell\nu}-80.4}{8.04}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{m_{ \tau j}-80.4}{8.04}\right)^{2}\right].\]
6. A final selection criterion considers that the transverse momentum of the \(b\bar{b}\) system, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{b\bar{b}}\), should be sufficiently high to reject the backgrounds. It is then required that the accepted events have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{b\bar{b}}>\)200 GeV, while the \(m_{\mathrm{T2}}\) variable should satisfy \(m_{\mathrm{T2}}>220\) GeV.

## 6 Results

In Tables 3-7 one can find the results for the _had-had_, _lep-lep_ and _lep-had_ channels, with the less relevant backgrounds for each channel being under the "others" category.

Table 3 shows the final expected signal and background yields in the _had-had_ channel. For this channel, the "others" category comprises: \(ZZ\), \(WH\), \(WZ\), \(gg\to H\to ZZ^{*}\to llqq\), single-top (\(s\)-channel, \(t\)-channel and \(Wt\) production), \(t\bar{t}\gamma\), \(t\bar{t}H\), \(t\bar{t}W\) and \(t\bar{t}Z\). Tables 4, 5 and 6 summarize the results for the _lep-lep_ analysis, and under the "others" category, one can find: \(WW\), \(WZ\), \(W(\ell\nu_{\ell})\) + jets (with \(\ell=e,\mu,\tau\)), single-top (\(Wt\) production), \(ZH\), \(ZZ\), \(gg\to H\to ZZ^{*}\to llqq\), \(t\bar{t}H\), \(t\bar{t}W\) and \(t\bar{t}Z\). \(Z\to ee\) + jets, \(Z\to\mu\mu\) + jets, \(Z\to\tau\tau\) + jets, are relevant for \(ee\), \(\mu\mu\), \(e\mu\) sub-channels, respectively. Table 7 shows the _semi- leptonic_ analysis results for both electron and muon channels. The "others" category comprises: \(t\bar{t}\) (all-hadronic), \(ZZ\), \(ZH\), \(WH\), \(WZ\), \(gg\to H\to ZZ^{*}\to llqq\), single-top (\(s\)-channel, \(t\)-channel and \(Wt\) production), \(t\bar{t}\gamma\), \(t\bar{t}H\), \(t\bar{t}W\) and \(t\bar{t}Z\).

As one can see in the results shown in Tables 3-7, the way the signal scales with the Higgs trilinear self-coupling constant \(\lambda_{HHH}\) is different among the channels. This is justified by the fact that there is a difference in acceptance because there are different selection requirements in each channel. These selection conditions include a high \(p_{\rm T}\) requirement for the reconstructed Higgs boson (directly, through the \(p_{\rm T}^{bb}\) cut, or indirectly, through angular requirements demanding the Higgs decay products to be close by). This is quite relevant, if one takes into consideration studies of the Higgs boson momentum dependence as a function of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling constant as one can see in Ref. [4]. Albeit the referred studies rely on a different detector parametrisation, the results at parton level and general analyses suggest an interesting insight. Important to note is that, not only the cross section depends on the Higgs trilinear self-coupling constant \(\lambda_{HHH}\), but also the boost of the Higgs boson is strongly dependent on this coupling. Different cuts on the momentum of the Higgs boson are (directly or indirectly) applied in the different channels, leading to different selection efficiencies.

Table 8 summarizes the signal significance results for each Higgs trilinear self-coupling constant, \(\lambda_{HHH}\). The _had-had_ channel has an expected significance of \(\sim 0.5\) for detecting the SM double Higgs production; in the _lep-lep_ channel, the expected statistical significance is of the order of \(\sim 0.03\) for the electron-electron channel, \(\sim 0.04\) for the muon-muon channel and \(\sim 0.06\) for the electron-muon channel, due to the small number of signal events after the selection; while the expected statistical significance is \(\sim 0.3\) for each lepton channel in the _lep-had_ case.

## 7 Limit setting

As there is a high correlation between the cross section of the double Higgs production and the Higgs trilinear self-coupling \(\lambda_{HHH}\), this variable can be better studied using a shape analysis of key observables. In this document, we do not set limits on both variables and fix the Higgs trilinear self-coupling constant to the Standard Model value for the cross section upper limits calculation. By assuming the Standard Model cross section, and using the variation of the final yields as a function of \(\lambda_{HHH}\), we also present the limits in the self-coupling constant.

The previous results discussed in Section 6 have been used to estimate a significance under benchmark assumptions for the systematic uncertainties. HistFactory [38], RooStats and RooFit [39, 40] were used to perform this limit setting procedure, on which a likelihood for a particular signal assumption is defined as:

\[L(\mu,\Theta)=\prod_{i=0}^{\text{channels}}\frac{e^{-\mu\alpha_{\lambda,i} \sigma_{\lambda}+b_{i}}(\mu\alpha_{\lambda,i}\sigma_{\lambda}+b_{i})_{i}^{D}} {\Gamma(D_{i}+1)}C(\Theta) \tag{3}\]

where \(D\) is the expected data yield, \(b\) is the expected background yield, \(\sigma_{\lambda}\) is the cross section of the signal, \(a_{\lambda}\) is the acceptance of the signal and \(\mu\) is the signal strength, which is the parameter of interest. The signal considered includes all double Higgs production modes, while the background includes all SM processes that do not produce two Higgs bosons. The function \(C\) indicates the set of constraints applied in the nuisance parameters \(\Theta\), such as the systematic uncertainties in the background and signal normalisations and the luminosity measurement uncertainty. The contraints in \(C\) model the systematic uncertainties described in the next paragraphs by using a log-normal distribution.

The hypothesis testing is based on the profile likelihood ratio test statistic \(\Lambda\), defined as follows:

\[\Lambda(\mu)=\frac{L(\mu,\hat{\Theta}(\mu))}{L(\hat{\mu},\hat{\Theta})}, \tag{4}\]

where the single circumflex indicates the unconditional maximum likelihood estimate of a parameter, while the double circumflex indicates the maximum likelihood estimate assuming a specific value of \(\mu\). Assuming that the test statistic \(-2\ln(\Lambda(\mu))\) is distributed according to a \(\chi^{2}\) distribution with one degree of freedom, the variation on the logarithm of the likelihood can be used to set a 95% Confidence Level on the upper limit of the signal production cross section times branching ratio, and to estimate the impact of the systematic uncertainties in the discovery significance.

For this approach, we have taken studies performed in the \(H\rightarrow\tau\tau\) measurement [41] as a reference for the background estimates using data-driven methods, which claims a background modelling systematic uncertainty of \(\sim 3\%\) for the \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Z\) + jets backgrounds. In the \(\tau_{\text{had}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) channel, the QCD backgrounds were also assumed to have a 3% background modelling uncertainty. Other backgrounds are expected to use a Monte Carlo based technique and a 5% overall cross section uncertainty was considered. The luminosity uncertainty was taken to be 3% for the signal and the Monte Carlo estimated backgrounds. And finally, the uncertainty for the signal is taken from its theoretical cross section as \(\pm 11\%\).

The \(p\)-value is calculated using \(\mu=1\) as the null hypothesis under the CLs method and it is translated into a \(n\)-sigma equivalent significance. Table 9 summarises the expected \(Z\)-values under the assumption that \(\lambda_{HHH}=\lambda_{\text{SM}}\) and \(\mu=1\) for the \(\tau_{\text{had}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) and the \(\tau_{\text{had}}\tau_{\text{lep}}\) channels and their combinations. The \(\tau_{\text{lep}}\tau_{\text{lep}}\) channel has not been used, since it has no effect in the final discovery significance due to its small signal tobackground ratio. The total combined significance is estimated at 0.60. The statistical uncertainty in the signal limits the discovery significance, but the \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Z\)+jets systematic uncertainties have a significant impact in the results. Studies have shown that the significance extracted here could be increased by \(\sim 10\%\) with smaller systematic uncertainties in these dominating backgrounds.

The combined \(Z\)-values using all channels, assuming different \(\lambda_{HHH}\) configurations and \(\mu=1\) are shown in Table 10. It can be seen that the configurations \(\lambda_{HHH}=2\lambda_{\rm SM}\), \(\lambda_{HHH}=0\) and \(\lambda_{HHH}=10\lambda_{\rm SM}\) have a combined significance of 0.40, 0.84 and 1.14 respectively. Using this technique to set a limit, we project a 95% Confidence Level upper limit for the cross section of \(HH\) production multiplied by its \(bb\tau\tau\) branching ratio of 4.3 \(\times\sigma(HH\to bb\tau\tau)_{\rm SM}\).

Under the assumption that one has a Standard Model Higgs trilinear self-coupling constant \(\lambda_{HHH}\), one can also use this to estimate the impact of this result in the Beyond Standard Model values of the coupling. This is done by using the 95% Confidence Level upper limit for \(\lambda_{HHH}=\lambda_{\rm SM}\) and comparing it to the expected number of events in the current selection, for different values of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling \(\lambda_{HHH}\).

Figure 9 shows the results of the latter approach, on which the expected number of events have been normalised by the SM expectation and a fit has been done to a second order polynomial, based on the theory dependency of the cross section as a function of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling \(\lambda_{HHH}\). Note that the selection requirements applied reduce the sensitivity to \(\lambda_{HHH}\).

It is important to remark that this is a simple cut and count experiment, and due to the dependency of the cross section on the Higgs trilinear self-coupling \(\lambda_{HHH}\), the limits shown here cannot separate those parameters. We leave for a future study to use the shape information in the Higgs boson kinematics in order to extract direct limits on the coupling constant. Using the \(\tau_{\rm had}\tau_{\rm had}\) channel, we can project an exclusion at 95% Confidence Level of BSM couplings with \(\lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{\rm SM}\leq-4\) and \(\lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{\rm SM}\geq 12\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \(\lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{\rm SM}\) & Expected \(Z\)-value \\ \hline

## 8 Conclusions

Cut and count studies have been performed on Monte Carlo simulation under several effective assumptions of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling constant \(\lambda_{HHH}\) for three different channels on the \(HH\to bb\tau\tau\) final state. In each case, the selection has been optimised to maximise the signal to background ratio, considering most of the reducible and irreducible backgrounds. A parametrisation of the ATLAS detector has been used to estimate the impact of its performance in rejecting the backgrounds.

As a final result, the expected significance for detecting the signal has been calculated combining the different channels under a 3% luminosity uncertainty and a 3% background modelling uncertainty assumption for the main backgrounds. Under such conditions, it is expected that the signal would have a significance of \(0.60\sigma\), while if the effective Higgs trilinear self-coupling \(\lambda_{HHH}\) is twice the SM prediction, a significance of \(0.40\sigma\) could be reached and if it is zero, the significance would be \(0.84\sigma\). Assuming we have Standard Model data, we can also set an upper limit of \(4.3\times\sigma(HH\to b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-})\) at 95% Confidence Level on the signal cross section. Finally, we can project an exclusion at 95% Confidence Level of BSM \(HH\) production with \(\lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{\rm SM}\leq-4\) and \(\lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{\rm SM}\geq 12\).

Figure 9: 95% Confidence Level upper limit on the cross section of the \(HH\to bb\tau\tau\) assuming Standard Model couplings is shown in the dashed line with its 68% and 95% error bands. The solid black, dashed blue and dotted violet lines show a fit of the expected number of events normalised by the SM number of events for different \(\lambda_{HHH}\) after the selection for the \(\tau_{\rm had}\tau_{\rm had}\), \(\tau_{\rm sep}\tau_{\rm had}\) electron and muon channels.
