Introduction

The design of the ATLAS experiment has been optimized to cover a large spectrum of possible physics signatures, accessible at the high luminosity and centre-of-mass energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. In the main focus of the experiment will be the investigation of the nature of the electroweak symmetry breaking, and therefore the search for the Higgs boson. Another important aspect will be the search for physics beyond the Standard Model, including searches for particles predicted by supersymmetry or technicolor theories, new gauge bosons and searches for composite quarks and leptons. Besides the discovery potential for new physics the ATLAS experiment has also a large potential to perform precision measurements of Standard Model parameters, like measurements of the W and top quark masses or triple gauge boson couplings.

The physics potential of the ATLAS experiment in these areas is briefly summarized in the following. For details the reader is referred to the _ATLAS Detector and Physics Performance Technical Design Report_[1], where all relevant ATLAS studies on the physics potential are documented. In that report the reader will also find a discussion of those physics items which are not covered here, like tests of Quantumchromodynamics and investigations in B-Physics.

## 2 LHC running scenarios and cross sections

Throughout the paper, it is assumed that an initial luminosity of \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) (hereafter called _low luminosity_) can be achieved. It is expected that this value should rise, during the first three years of operation, to the design luminosity of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) (hereafter called _high luminosity_). Integrated luminosities of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\), 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) should therefore be collected after one year, three years, four years and less than ten years of data taking, respectively.

Due to the expected high machine luminosity the production rates of many relevant physics processes are large. The expected cross sections and the corresponding event rates are shown in Table 1. In the initial phase at low luminosity, almost 50 W and five Z bosons decaying to lepton pairs will be produced every second, as well as one \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) pair and 500,000 b\(\mathrm{\overline{b}}\) pairs. The copious \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) production will constitute a significant background for many searches of new physics signals since it may lead to characteristic final states with leptons, jets and missing transverse energy \(E_{T}^{miss}\).

The physics performance has been evaluated using the following assumptions: (i) Despite the considerable progress in the calculation of higher order QCDcorrections over the last years, these corrections (K-factors) are not known for all signal and background processes of interest. Therefore, the ATLAS studies have consistently and conservatively refrained from using K-factors, resorting to Born-level predictions for both signals and backgrounds. (ii) The non diffractive inelastic cross section has been assumed to be 70 mb. At low luminosity, this leads on average to a superposition of 2.3 minimum bias events on top of the hard collision. These so called pile-up contributions have been included for both low and high luminosity. (iii) Physics processes have been simulated with the PYTHIA Monte Carlo [2] program, including initial- and final-state radiation, hadronisation and decays. Although many results have been obtained using a fast simulation of the ATLAS detector, all key performance characteristics have been evaluated with a full GEANT simulation, both at low and high luminosity [1].

## 3 The search for the Higgs boson

The Standard Model Higgs boson is searched for at the LHC in various decay channels, the choice of which is given by the signal rates and the signal-to-background ratios in the various mass regions. The search strategies and background rejection methods have been established through many studies over the past years [1].

The overall sensitivity for the discovery of a Standard Model Higgs boson over the mass range from 80 GeV to 1 TeV is shown in Fig.1. The sensitivity is given for individual channels as well as for the combination of the various channels, assuming integrated luminosities of 30 and 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). A Standard Model Higgs boson can be discovered in the ATLAS experiment over the full mass range from the LEP2

lower limit up to the TeV range with a high significance. A \(5\sigma\)-discovery can already be achieved over the full mass range after a few years of running at low luminosity. Over a large fraction of the mass range the discovery of a Standard Model Higgs boson will be possible in two or more independent channels.

The search of the Standard Model Higgs boson is challenging in the intermediate mass region, \(m_{\,H}<2m_{Z}\). Even though the natural width of the Standard Model Higgs boson in this mass range is narrow, the backgrounds from \(t\overline{t}\) and continuum \(ZZ\) or \(WW\) production are relatively large and thus, an excellent detector performance in terms of energy resolution and background rejection is required. The \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) decay mode requires high performance of the electromagnetic calorimetry in terms of photon energy resolution, photon direction measurements, and \(\gamma\)/jet separation. Impact parameter measurements in the Inner Detector are crucial for the discovery of the \(b\overline{b}\) decay mode. Finally, excellent performance in terms of the identification, reconstruction and measurement of isolated leptons with \(P_{T}>7\) GeV is required to discover the Higgs boson in the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\,l\) channel with a high significance. For Higgs-boson masses close to 170 GeV, the signal significance in

Figure 1: _Sensitivity for the discovery of a Standard Model Higgs boson as a function of the Higgs boson mass. The statistical significances are plotted for individual channels as well as for the combination of all channels, assuming integrated luminosities of 30 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) (left) and 100 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) (right). Depending on the numbers of signal and background events, the statistical significance has been computed as \(S/\sqrt{B}\) or using Poisson statistics. In the case of the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\) channel, a systematic uncertainty of 5% on the total number of background events has been included._

the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4l\) channel is reduced, due to the suppression of the ZZ* branching ratio as the WW decay mode opens up. In the case of \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\) decays, however, it is not possible to reconstruct the Higgs-boson mass peak. Instead, an excess of events has to be used to identify the presence of a Higgs-boson signal. The signal significance in this channel depends critically on the absolute knowledge of the background. If a relative uncertainty on the background of \(\pm 5\%\) is assumed, the signal significance exceeds \(5\sigma\) in the mass range between \(\sim\)150 GeV and 190 GeV.

For Higgs-boson masses in the range 180 GeV \(<m_{{}_{H}}<\sim\) 600 GeV, the \(H\to ZZ\to 4l\) decay mode is the most reliable channel for the discovery of a Standard Model Higgs boson at the LHC. The expected background, which is dominated by the continuum production of Z boson pairs, is smaller than the signal. In the mass range between 600 GeV and about 1 TeV, a Higgs boson would be discovered in the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) mode. The sensitivity in this channel can also be extended down to lower masses, where it provides independent and complementary information to the four-lepton channel. For \(400<m_{{}_{H}}<900\) GeV the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) channel is complemented by the \(H\to ZZ\to lljj\) and \(H\to ZZ\to ll\nu\nu\) channels, which would provide additional robustness to a Higgs boson discovery in this mass range.

It has also been shown that important Higgs boson parameters like the mass and the width as well as production rates can be measured with a reasonable precision. With an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) ATLAS would measure the Higgs-boson mass with a precision of 0.1% over the mass range 80 - 400 GeV, the Higgs-boson width with a precision of 6% over the mass range 300 - 700 GeV, the Higgs-boson production rate with a precision of \(\sim\)10%, and several important couplings and branching ratios with a precision of the order of 25% [1].

The ATLAS experiment has also a large potential in the investigation of the MSSM Higgs sector. If the SUSY mass scale is large and supersymmetric particles do not appear in the Higgs decay products, the full parameter space in the conventional \((m_{{}_{A}},\tan\beta)\) plane can be covered. The \(5\sigma\) discovery contour curves are shown in Fig. 2 for individual channels and for integrated luminosities of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). In addition to the channels discussed for the Standard Model case, the MSSM Higgs search relies heavily on the \(H/A\to\tau\tau\) channel, on the \(t\overline{t}h\) with \(h\to b\overline{b}\) and on the direct and associated \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) channels. Over a large fraction of the parameter space more than one Higgs boson and/or more than one decay mode would be accessible. For almost all cases, the experiment would be able to distinguish between the Standard Model and the MSSM models. This complete coverage can also be reached independent on the mixing scenario in the stop-sbottom sector.

The interplay between SUSY particles and the Higgs sector has also been addressed in the ATLAS studies. SUSY scenarios have an impact on the discovery potential through the opening of Higgs-boson decays to SUSY particles (mostly for H and A) and through the presence of SUSY particles in loops (mostly for production via \(gg\) fusion and for \(H\!\rightarrow\!\gamma\gamma\) decays). Scenarios in which SUSY particles are light and appear as Higgs decay products have been studied in the framework of SUGRA models. The discovery potential of the lightest neutral Higgs \(h\) would not be significantly different from what is obtained in the heavy SUSY scenario, since within the model, given present experimental constraints, the decay of \(h\) to the lightest SUSY particles is kinematically forbidden. Moreover, over a large fraction of the SUGRA parameter space, the \(h\) boson would appear at the end of the decay cascade of SUSY particles in the channel \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}h\) which will be observable with the ATLAS detector (see below). The neutral heavy Higgs bosons would be detected in some cases via their decays into neutralinos and charginos, using multi-lepton final states.

In the absence of a scalar Higgs boson, the principal probe for the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking will be gauge boson scattering at high energies. It has been shown that ATLAS will be sensitive to the presence of res

The \(5\sigma\) discovery contour curves are shown in the \((m_{A},\tan\beta)\) plane for individual channels and for integrated luminosities of 30 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) (left) and 300 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) (right). Also included are the present LEP2 limits (for an integrated luminosity of 175 \(\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) per experiment) and the expected ultimate LEP2 limit (for an integrated luminosity of 200 \(\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) per experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of 200 GeV)._

onances, such as in the WZ system, up to masses around 1.5 TeV. A study of nonresonant processes, such as the \(W^{+}W^{+}\) production, will require a few years of high luminosity running and a good understanding of the underlying backgrounds.

## 4 Search for Supersymmetry

If Supersymmetry (SUSY) [3] exists at the electroweak scale, its discovery at the LHC should be straightforward. The SUSY cross section is dominated by gluinos and squarks, which are strongly produced with cross sections comparable to the Standard Model backgrounds at the same \(Q^{2}\). Gluinos and squarks then decay via a series of steps into the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), which may itself decay, if R-parity is violated. These decay chains lead to a variety of signatures involving multiple jets, leptons, photons, heavy flavours, W and Z bosons, and missing energy. The combination of a large production cross section and distinctive signatures makes it easy to separate SUSY from the Standard Model background. Assuming, for example, an integrated luminosity of only 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) the reach in the jets + \(E_{T}^{miss}\) channel extends to squark and gluino masses greater than 2 TeV. The reach in the multi-lepton channel extends to masses well beyond 1 TeV. Therefore, the main challenge is not to discover SUSY but to separate the many SUSY processes that occur and to measure the masses and other properties of the SUSY particles.

The approach followed by the ATLAS collaboration has been to investigate in detail the signatures for particular points in the parameter spaces of the minimal supergravity (SUGRA) model [4], Gauge Mediated SUSY breaking (GMSB) models [5], and R-parity violating models [3]. Methods such as looking for kinematic endpoints for mass distributions and using these to determine combinations of masses have proven generally useful.

As an example, the production of \(\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm R}\), followed by the decays \(\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}\to{\rm q}\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\), \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\to\tilde{\ell}_{R}\ell\), \(\tilde{\ell}_{R}\to\ell\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\), can be selected in an inclusive way by requiring two leptons in the final state with the same flavour and opposite sign, large \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) and jet multiplicity (the last two cuts are needed to reject the Standard Model background). The resulting invariant mass distribution of the two leptons in the final state is shown in Fig. 3 (for a simulation of SUGRA study point 5, see Ref. [1]). A clear signal is visible above the background. The mass distribution shows a very sharp end-point, which is due to the kinematic properties of the decay and depends on the masses of the particles involved, the two lightest neutralinos and the slepton, through a simple kinematic relation. The position of the end-point can be measured with a precision of 500 MeV (0.5%) with an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), thus providing a combined constraint on the three masses mentioned above.

Another example is the search for the \(h\to b\overline{b}\) decay in SUSY events. If the two-body decay \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}h\) is kinematically allowed, it generally has a substantial branching ratio because the light neutralinos are dominantly gauginos. In many cases it is possible to reconstruct \(H\to b\overline{b}\) as a resonance peak in the SUSY event sample, after applying simple kinematic cuts. An \(E_{T}^{miss}\) requirement usually suppresses the Standard Model background. An example of a reconstructed mass peak (for SUGRA study point 5, see Ref. [1]) is shown in Fig.3 (right). For an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) there are 980 signal events with a SUSY background of 180 events and a Standard Model background of only 75 events in a bin of \(\pm 25\) GeV around the Higgs mass. This signal may be easier to detect than \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) and so it may provide the discovery mode for the light Higgs boson, although the \(\gamma\gamma\) signal is still important to measure the mass precisely. The Higgs signal can also provide a good starting point for further analysis of SUSY particles.

Given the success in extracting precise measurements for the points studied and the large number of SUSY events expected at the LHC, ATLAS is likely not just to discover SUSY if it exists but to make many precise measurements. The starting point in this study will be to look for characteristic deviations from the

Shown are in each case the signal (solid), the background from SUSY events (dashed) and the Standard Model background (dotted)._

Standard Model. In SUGRA and some other models, there would be events with multiple jets and leptons plus large \(E_{T}^{miss}\). In GMSB models, there would be events with prompt photons or quasi-stable sleptons. In R-parity violating models, there would be events with very high jet multiplicity and/or leptons. Any such signal would point to possible classes of models and would indicate the rough mass scale. The next step would be to use partial reconstruction methods, like the ones shown above, to try to constrain as many combinations of masses as possible.

## 5 Other physics beyond the Standard Model

The ATLAS experiment will also be sensitive to a variety of other possible extensions of the Standard Model. Discovery limits for other phenomena are summarized below, assuming an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). For more details the reader is referred to Ref. [1].

* Technicolor resonances can be searched for in their decays to a pair of gauge bosons, or to a techi-pion and a gauge boson. The ATLAS sensitivity for these resonances extends up to the TeV range. Although the technicolor parameter space is very large, there is a number of potential channels which allow for combinations of signatures to help in understanding the nature of the resonances.
* Excited quarks should be detected up to masses in the order of 5-6 TeV.
* The discovery potential for first generation leptoquarks extends up to \(\sim\)1.5 TeV (assuming \(BR(LQ\to eq=0.5)\)).
* New vector bosons (W' and Z') should be detectable up to masses in the order of 5-6 TeV.
* The high mass di-jet angular distribution has an excellent sensitivity to quark compositeness. One month of LHC operation at low luminosity allows discovering quark substructure if the constituent interaction constant is of the order of 14 TeV. An integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) is needed to reach a 95% CL limit of 40 TeV.

Precision measurements of Standard Model parameters

### Measurement of the W mass

At the time of the LHC start-up, the W mass will be known with a precision of \(\sim\)30 MeV from measurements at the Tevatron [6] and LEP2 [7]. The motivation to improve this result is mainly that precise measurements of the W mass, of the top mass and of the Higgs mass will provide stringent tests of the consistency of the underlying theory. With a top mass measured with an accuracy of \(\sim\)1.5 GeV, the W mass should be known with a matching precision of 15 MeV, in order not to become the dominant source of uncertainty in the test of the radiative corrections.

At hadron colliders, the W mass is obtained from the distribution of the W transverse mass, defined as \(M_{T}=\sqrt{2P_{T}(e)P_{T}(\nu)(1-\cos\,\Delta\phi)}\), where \(P_{T}(e)\) and \(P_{T}(\nu)\) are the transverse momenta of the lepton and the neutrino, respectively, and \(\Delta\phi\) is the angular separation between the momentum vectors in the transverse plane.

At the LHC, sixty million well-reconstructed W\(\rightarrow\ell\nu\) decays (where \(\ell=\) e or \(\mu\)) should be collected by each experiment in one year of data taking at low luminosity. The statistical error on the W mass measurement is therefore expected to be small (\(<\) 2 MeV). The systematic error will arise mainly from the Monte Carlo reliability in reproducing the data, i.e., the physics and the detector performance. Uncertainties related to the physics result from the limited knowledge of the W \(P_{T}\) spectrum, structure functions, the W width and from W radiative decays. Uncertainties related to the detector result from the limited knowledge of the absolute lepton energy scale and the detector energy/momentum resolution and response. Many of these uncertainties (lepton scale, detector resolution and response and the W \(P_{T}\) spectrum) will be constrained in the experiment by using the high-statistics sample of leptonic Z decays.

Preliminary estimates of the expected uncertainties on the W mass measurement in ATLAS, based in part on extrapolating from Tevatron results, indicate, that like at the Tevatron [8], also at the LHC the dominant uncertainty will originate from the calibration of the absolute lepton energy scale. For the W mass to be measured to better than 20 MeV, the lepton scale has to be known with a precision of 0.02%, which represents the most serious challenge for this measurement.

All other systematic uncertainties are expected to be smaller than 10 MeV. By combining both ATLAS and CMS and both channels (electrons and muons), it should be possible to obtain a total error of 15 MeV in the initial, low luminosity phase, provided the precison on the lepton energy scale can be reached. Improved theoretical calculations, in particular of the W \(P_{T}\) spectrum and of the impact of radiative corrections, will also be important to achieve this goal.

### Measurement of Triple-Gauge Couplings

The study of Triple-Gauge Couplings (TGCs), i.e. couplings of the type WW\(\gamma\) or WWZ, provides a direct test of the non-abelian structure of the Standard Model gauge group. Assuming electromagnetic gauge invariance, C- and P-conservation, this sector of the Standard Model can be described by five parameters: \(g_{1}^{\rm Z}\), \(\kappa_{\rm Z}\), \(\kappa_{\gamma}\), \(\lambda_{\rm Z}\), \(\lambda_{\gamma}\). New physics could show up as deviations of these parameters from their Standard Model values, which are zero for the \(\lambda\) parameters and one for the \(\kappa\) and \(g\) parameters. The LHC has a large potential for testing the TGCs because the sensitivity to the anomalous contributions is enhanced at high centre-of-mass energies, particularly for \(\lambda\)-type couplings.

Triple-Gauge couplings will give rise to gauge boson pair production, e.g., W\(\gamma\), WZ and WW production. The first two processes are characterised by relatively clean final states, containing one lepton and one photon or three leptons, respectively. The third process is less promising, since it suffers from a large tt background.

Anomalous couplings can affect both the total cross section and the shape of the differential distributions. This is illustrated in Fig. 4 where, as an example, the reconstructed \(P_{T}\) spectra of the Z boson in WZ events for the Standard Model and in presence of non-standard couplings are shown. An excess of events in the high-\(P_{T}\) tail is clearly visible in the case of anomalous couplings.

Assuming an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), the expected statistical precision at 95% CL from single parameter fits to the total cross section and to differential distributions is found to be 0.035 and 0.069 for \(\Delta\kappa_{\gamma}\) and \(\Delta\kappa_{Z}\) and 0.008 for \(\Delta g_{1}^{\rm Z}\), respectively. The corresponding values for \(\lambda_{\gamma}\) and \(\lambda_{Z}\) are 0.0025 and 0.0058. A form factor of \(\Lambda\)=10 TeV (see Ref. [1]) has been assumed in deriving these results. Based on a modest total integrated luminosity, these measurements would already improve on the final Tevatron and LEP2 precision expected to be in the range between \(\sim\)0.1 and \(\sim\)0.01 depending on the couplings. Systematic uncertainties due to higher order QCD corrections, structure functions, etc., are currently under study but are expected to be small.

### Top Quark Physics

At the LHC, top quark measurements will benefit from the large \(t\overline{t}\) event samples, so that not only the mass and the production cross section, but also branching ratios, couplings and rare decays can be studied in detail. In the year 2005, the top mass should be known with a precision of 3 GeV or better from measurements at the Tevatron [6]. At the LHC the best channel for the top mass measurement will most likely be \(\rm t\overline{t}\) production with one W decaying leptonically and the other one hadronically. The top mass will be determined from the hadronic part of the decay, as the invariant mass of the three jets originating from the same top (\(m_{t}=m_{\rm jb}\)). The associated leptonic top decay will be used to trigger the events and to suppress backgrounds.

The statistical error is expected to be smaller than 100 MeV, the precision will be limited by the systematic error. An expected uncertainty of 1% on the absolute jet scale should translate into an uncertainty smaller than 1 GeV on the top mass. The effect of final-state gluon radiation is estimated to lead to an uncertainty of \(\sim\)1 GeV. Other sources of systematic uncertainties such as those related to b-fragmentation, initial state radiation, and backgrounds are expected to be smaller. All together, a total uncertainty smaller than 1% should be achieved. This precision may be further improved by using \(\rm t\overline{t}\) pairs produced with very high \(P_{T}\).

Examples of other measurements which can be performed in the top sector are:

Figure 4: _Reconstructed \(P_{T}\) of the Z boson in WZ events, as expected in ATLAS for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). The shaded and white histograms show, respectively, the Standard Model expectation and the distribution obtained for \(\Delta g_{1}^{\rm Z}=0.05\)._

* The tt production cross section should be determined with a precision \(\leq 10\%\), dominated by the uncertainty on the absolute luminosity.
* Single top production via the weak interaction, should allow the CKM matrix element \(V_{\rm tb}\) to be measured with a precision of \(10\%\) or better.
* Upper limits at the level of \(10^{-4}-10^{-5}\) on the FCNC couplings \(tVc\) and \(tVu\) with \(V=Z\), \(\gamma\), \(g\) should be set with \(100\) fb\({}^{-1}\), improving the Tevatron sensitivity by a factor of at least 10.

## 7 Conclusions

The ATLAS experiment in its final layout and optimization is well matched to search for physics beyond the Standard Model and to investigate the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking. The large event samples, which will be produced at the LHC for many physics processes, will allow in addition to perform precision measurements of important parameters of the Standard Model.
