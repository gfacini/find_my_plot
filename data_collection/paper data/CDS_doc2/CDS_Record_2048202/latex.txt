## 1 Introduction

Electrons in the central region of the ATLAS detector [1] (\(|\eta|^{1}<2.47\)) are reconstructed from energy deposits in the electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter that are matched to tracks in the inner detector. The track are required to have a minimum number of hits in the tracking detectors. A good understanding of the capabilities of the ATLAS detector to identify signal electrons and reject background objects is crucial to any physics analysis with electrons in the final state. In this note, signal electrons are defined as prompt electrons from massive \(W\), \(Z\) or top quark decays, while backgrounds include hadronic jets as well as electrons from photon conversions, Dalitz decays and semi-leptonic heavy flavor hadron decays. Prompt electrons are distinguished from background objects by cutting on the output of a multivariate likelihood function based on the shapes of electromagnetic showers in the calorimeter as well as tracking and track-to-cluster matching quantities [2].

Electron identification efficiencies are defined as the efficiencies of the likelihood selection with respect to reconstructed electron candidates. They are measured in \(pp\) data taken at a center-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV in 2015 with spacing of subsequent LHC bunches of 50 ns and compared to efficiencies measured in a simulated \(Z\to ee\) sample.

## 2 Identification

Signal electrons are identified by different sets of likelihood-based identification criteria which are chosen to be \(\sim\)95%, 90% and 80% efficient for electrons with \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(\approx\) 40 GeV, and referred to as _loose_, _medium_ and _tight_ operating points respectively.

The variables used in the electron identification are summarized in Table 1 and described in more detail in Refs. [2; 3; 4].

Shower shapes are computed exploiting the lateral and longitudinal segmentation of the EM and hadronic calorimeters. The ATLAS tracking detector consists from the inside out of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon strip detector and a transition radiation tracker. The latter provides not only tracking capabilities but also discriminates between electrons and charged hadrons via the detection of X-rays produced by transition radiation. The shower shapes, track-cluster matching and some of the track quality distributions from simulated signal and background samples are used to form a likelihood discriminator. In addition, cuts are applied on the number of hits in the inner detector. The cut applied on the likelihood discriminator depends on the \(|\eta|\) and transverse energy \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the electron and is adjusted for the three identification operating points, according to the target efficiency. To allow the use of the selected _loose_ electrons in conversion background estimates, the requirement of the number of track hits in the innermost detector layer is dropped. For all operating points, \(f_{3}\) is not used above 100 GeV, to avoid efficiency losses. The cut on the likelihood discriminator is corrected depending on the number of primary collision vertices in the event, accounting for the impact of additional interactions on its input distributions.

## 3 Data and simulated samples

The identification efficiencies are measured using a data sample with an integrated luminosity of \(\int\!\mathcal{L}\,\mathrm{dt}=85\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) collected with the ATLAS experiment during June and July 2015. Only data in which all relevant detector components, including the magnets, were fully functional have been used. The spacing of subsequent LHC bunches was 50 ns.

The measured data efficiencies are compared to efficiencies extracted from a simulated \(Z\to ee\) sample that was passed through the GEANT4 detector simulation [5; 6]. The generator used is Powheg[7; 8; 9] interfaced with Pythia8[10; 11] for parton showering. The simulated sample is reweighted to the average number of interactions observed in data.

## 4 Selection and methodology

Electrons are selected in the central region of the ATLAS detector (\(|\eta|<2.47\)). The efficiency measurements follow closely the methods described for the 2012 measurements in Ref. [2] for electrons with \(E_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV. Efficiencies are measured double-differentially as a function of electron \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\). They are also studied as a function of the number of primary collision vertices to investigate a potential dependence of the efficiencies on the presence of additional interactions.

A tag-and-probe method is employed, selecting electrons from \(Z\to ee\) decays. The method requires the presence of an isolated identified electron referred to as the tag. Events are required to be selected by at least one of two triggers requiring an electromagnetic energy deposit above 24 or 60 GeV with a matched track, passing isolation and shower shape criteria. The selected tag electron is required to be matched to the triggering object and to have a transverse momentum larger than 25 GeV. It is required to pass the _tight_ selection. The probe is a second reconstructed electron candidate. The invariant mass of the two electron candidates \(m_{ee}\) is required to be close to the nominal mass of the \(Z\) boson, \(75<m_{ee}<\)105 GeV. With these requirements, about 74000 reconstructed electron candidates are selected as probe electrons in data. No isolation cut is applied on the probe.

The identification selection applied to the tag electron is varied to estimate the systematic uncertainty due to the selection: apart from the _tight_ selection, alternatively either the _medium_ selection and additional isolation cuts or the _tight_ selection and additional isolation requirements are applied on the energy around the electron, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{iso}\)2. Alternative mass windows, used for the assessment of systematic uncertainties, are \(80<m_{ee}<\)100 GeV and \(70<m_{ee}<\)110 GeV.

Footnote 2: \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{iso}\) is defined as the sum of energies of clusters around the electron in a cone with radius \(\Delta R=0.3\) or 0.4, excluding cells in a window of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.125\times 0.175\) around the electron cluster barycenter. The sum is corrected for the energy leakage from the electron to the isolation cone and for the effect of pile-up using the ambient energy density computed event-by-event.

The background in the probe sample needs to be subtracted in order to determine the efficiencies for prompt electrons only. Background templates are created from data by reversing the selection criteria on the shower shapes of the probe electrons. These templates are determined for each \(\eta\), \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) bin listed below and are normalized to data in background-dominated sidebands. Two methods are used to discriminate between prompt electrons from \(Z\to ee\) decays and background: In the mass-based method, the invariant mass distribution of the dielectron system is used. The background template is normalized in the high mass region (\(120<m_{ee}<250\) GeV), and, as systematic variation for probes below 30 GeV, in the low mass region (\(60<m_{ee}<70\) GeV). In the isolation-based method the isolation distribution of the probe\(E_{\rm T}^{iso}(\Delta R=0.3)\) is used. The background template is normalized to the data above \(E_{\rm T}^{iso}(\Delta R=0.3)>\)10, 12.5 and 15 GeV. \(E_{\rm T}^{iso}(\Delta R=0.4)\) is used as additional systematic variation.

Systematic uncertainties are determined as described in Ref. [2]: the discussed variations are applied on the tag electron selection, the \(Z\) mass window, the template selection, as well as the normalization range for the background subtraction. As the mass- and isolation-based methods are based on the same events, but differ in the background subtraction which is the largest source of systematic uncertainties for probes with \(E_{\rm T}\)< 30 GeV, they are considered to be variations of the same efficiency measurement. The mean of the efficiencies measured with these variations is taken as central efficiency value, while the RMS of all variations is taken to be its systematic uncertainty (since the distributions are non-Gaussian for probes with \(E_{\rm T}\)< 30 GeV, the RMS is scaled to contain 68% of all variations). The statistical uncertainty is calculated as the average statistical uncertainty of all variations. The variations are also used to extract bin-to-bin correlations that can be used in pseudo-experiments reducing the uncertainties when the efficiency uncertainties are evaluated for physics measurements.

Figures 1 and 2 show examples of the background subtraction in selected \(\eta\), \(E_{\rm T}\) bins for reconstructed probes as well as for probes passing the likelihood _medium_ identification for the mass-based and the isolation-based background subtraction methods. An overall satisfactory description of the data shapes is observed.

The central values of the efficiencies are determined by taking the ratio of probe electrons passing the identification criteria to all selected probe electrons in each \(\eta\), \(E_{\rm T}\) bin, using a 2D grid with

\(\eta\): -2.47, -2.37, -2.01, -1.52, -1.37, -0.8, -0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 1.37, 1.52, 2.01, 2.37, 2.47

\(E_{\rm T}\) [GeV]: 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 80.

Efficiencies are determined by taking the ratio of background subtracted probes passing the likelihood identification over background subtracted probes at reconstruction level. The simulated \(Z\to ee\) sample is shown for illustration and is scaled to match the background subtracted data in the \(Z\)-mass window. Since at reconstruction level the background sample is a subsample of the selected events, fluctuations can be fully correlated.

## 5 Results

For probes with \(E_{\rm T}\) above 30 GeV, the mass- and isolation-based \(Z\) tag-and-probe methods yield compatible results. At lower \(E_{\rm T}\), there is a systematic difference due to the imperfect background subtraction. Therefore, as described above, mass- and isolation-based \(Z\) tag-and-probe methods are treated as systematic variations of one method. Figure 3 shows the efficiencies measured in data for the three likelihood operating points, projected into 1D as a function of \(\eta\) and \(E_{\rm T}\). These projections are derived by applying (efficiency in data)/(efficiency in simulation) ratios, which are binned in 2D, to the efficiency prediction from simulated Z\(\to ee\) decays. Two sets of total uncertainties are shown: for the larger error bars, both statistical and systematic uncertainties are assumed to be fully correlated in the different \(\eta\)/\(E_{\rm T}\) bins, and therefore reflect the limited statistic for each 2D bin. The smaller error bars are obtained with pseudo-experiments, treating the statistical uncertainties as uncorrelated. The efficiencies directly obtained from a simulated \(Z\to ee\) are shown as well.

The measured efficiencies for the _loose_, _medium_ and _tight_ operating points are \(\sim\)95%, 90% and 85% if integrated over \(\eta\) and \(E_{\rm T}\). They show a dependence on the \(\eta\) of the electron reflecting the calorimeter and inner detector structure and the material distribution of the detector. The efficiency increase with \(E_{\rm T}\) is due to the tuning of the likelihood, allowed by the quickly falling background rates. Disagreements between efficiencies obtained in data and in the simulated samples of around 5% are observed. They are of the same order as observed in the 2010\(-\)2012 data set [2; 3; 4], and due to the known mismodelling of shower shapes and other identification variables in the simulation. As applied in Fig. 3, the ratios of efficiencies measured in data and the simulation ("scale factors") and the associated uncertainties are used in physics analyses to correct the yield of electrons in simulated samples. If the statistical uncertainties are treated as correlated, the total uncertainties vary between 3 and 5% and are dominated in most bins by the statistical uncertainty of the data sample. If the statistical uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated, for the \(E_{\rm T}\) bin 35\(-\)40 GeV, the total uncertainty drops to 0.5%.

The robustness of the identification efficiencies versus pileup has been tested and efficiencies are shown as

Efficiencies are determined by taking the ratio of background subtracted probes passing the likelihood identification over background subtracted probes at reconstruction level. The background template is normalized above an isolation energy of 12.5 GeV as indicated by the dashed line. The simulated \(Z\to ee\) sample is shown for illustration and is scaled to match the background subtracted data below the dashed line.

a function of the number of reconstructed primary vertices in Fig. 4. These efficiencies are derived directly using the mass-based \(Z\) tag-and-probe method, and are only binned in 1D as a function of the number of primary vertices. Efficiencies obtained from data show no significant dependence on the number of primary vertices. This behavior is very well modelled by the simulation. The distribution of the number of reconstructed primary vertices in the selected data events is overlayed in grey on these figures.

Two sets of total uncertainties are shown: For the larger error bars, both statistical and systematic uncertainties are assumed to be fully correlated in the different \(\eta/E_{\mathrm{T}}\) bins, and therefore reflect the limited statistic for each 2D bin. The smaller error bars are obtained with pseudo-experiments, treating the statistical uncertainties as uncorrelated.

## 6 Conclusion

Identification efficiencies have been determined for prompt electrons produced in \(Z\to ee\) events at a center-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV in data and in simulated samples. In the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) bin 35\(-\)40 GeV, the total uncertainty is to 0.5%, if the statistical uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated. Discrepancies of around 5% between data and simulation are due to known mismodelling of the shower shapes and some of the track properties by the simulation. The efficiencies are found to be robust with respect to the number of primary vertices, in the range probed by the available data.
