###### Abstract

The effects of radiation damage induced by neutrons and charged particles on the performance of a TILECAL Barrel hadron calorimeter are studied. For an integrated luminosity of 10\({}^{6}\)pb\({}^{-1}\) (10 years running at a peak luminosity of 1.6\(\times\)10\({}^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) the degradation on the jet energy resolution and the total light reduction are marginal, even when the 4 longitudinal sectors of the calorimeter are not periodically recalibrated. The largest effect is observed in the light reduction on the first tile, starting at 1.95\(\lambda\), and it is is 6.2% at \(\eta\) = 1.5 and 4.8% at \(\eta\) = 0. In the most exposed Barrel region (\(\eta\) = 1.5) the increase on the jet energy resolution of 300 GeV incident jets is 0.24% without longitudinal calibration and 0.16% when the calibration is applied. The total signal is reduced by 1.51% without calibration and 0.14% after calibration.

## 1 Dose Levels Expected in the Barrel Hadron Calorimeter in ATLAS.

The expected annual peak dose in the ATLAS barrel hadron calorimeter coming from charged particles and neutron fluxes (E\({}_{\rm H}\) > 100 keV) is 36 Gy/y1\({}^{2,2,3}\), considering a 5 cm polyethylene moderator in front of the LAr/Pb e.m. calorimeter and followed by a iron/plastic scintillator hadron calorimeter.

This dose has been obtained from a more general ATLAS setup: a mean medium in the calorimeters (LAr/Pb in the e.m. calorimeter and LAr/Iron in the had. calorimeter)\({}^{2,3}\). In the case of a iron/plastic scintillator calorimeter with a ratio of 4.5 to 1 (TILECAL), the dose induced by neutrons and charged particles in the plastic scintillator is higher and has been corrected for.

### 1.1 Corrections applied to the doses induced by neutrons

Neutrons produced in the hadronic shower will have a large \(\sigma_{\rm elast}\). to elastically scatter off the protons in the plastic scintillator of the TILECAL calorimeter. The neutron capture in Hydrogen is negligible with respect to the elastic scattering in the full energy range\({}^{5}\).

A relation between an integrated neutron fluence F\({}_{\rm H}\) (n/cm\({}^{2}\)) and the induced dose deposited in the plastic (Gy) considering only elastic processes (\(\sigma_{\rm elast}\) in cm\({}^{2}\)) is given by \({}^{6}\):

\[({\rm Dose})_{\rm H}={\rm F}_{\rm H}\frac{{\rm N}_{\rm o}\ \sigma_{\rm elast}}{{\rm A }}\ \ \frac{<\)E\(>}{2} \tag{1}\]

where N\({}_{\rm o}\) = 5.2x10\({}^{25}\) protons.kg\({}^{-1}\), A = 1 and \(<\)E\(>\)/2 is the mean energy (in J) of the proton recoil after elastic scattering. In the case of a mean medium of Fe/LAr (A>> 1) there is a negligible neutron contribution to the total dose.

The contribution of neutrons to the doses deposited in the plastic scintillator will be calculated directly from the neutron fluxes expected in the barrel hadron calorimeter. Only the fast (E\({}_{\rm H}\) > 100 keV) fluxes with a 5 cm polyethylene moderator in front of the LAr e.m. calorimeters, e.g. 1.0x10\({}^{12}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\) were considered. This value is reduced 14% when the LAr is

We observe that before irradiation the light output using the Y11(200ppm)M fibre pair is higher by about a factor of 1.5 with respect to the BCF91A fibre pair. This is mainly because the Y11(200ppm)M fibre has a double cladding (index of refraction n\({}_{\textrm{core}}\) = 1.59, rclad 1 = 1.49, rclad 2 = 1.42) which improves the light reflection in the core-cladding surface and increases the numerical aperture[10]. The light reduction after irradiation is about the same in both cases within the experimental errors. When the BCF91A fibres are used we observe a light reduction after irradiation of 14%, and 11% for the Y11(200ppm)M fibres.

The \(\Delta\) and @ points in fig. 2 for a dose of 2.75 kGy (0.275 Mrad-100 years working at LHC) correspond to the two TILECAL tile/fibre configuration assemblies (fig. 3), showing good agreement with the SDC results. The light reduction in the fibres is the major contribution to the global light reduction of the tile/fibre assemblies due to the non realistic fibre dose profile applied, mentioned before. This was confirmed redoing the scan of fig. 3a using the same tile but non irradiated BCF91A fibres. In this case a light reduction of 3.5% is observed.

The light attenuation curve of each individual fibre was also measured before and after irradiation. The light output ratio of each individual fibre type measured at a distance of 130 cm from the PMT over the signal measured at a distance of 40 cm from the PMT is shown in table 3 after normalizing to the respective ratio before irradiation.

Using the parametrized curve of the results shown in fig. 2 (eq. 2) we estimated the light yield ratio expected on the hadron calorimeter for \(\eta\) = 0 and \(\eta\) = 1.5 after an integrated luminosity of 10\({}^{6}\)pb\({}^{-1}\). Before recalibrating longitudinally each of the 4 cells the light reduction in the first tile (the worst case) is 6.2% for \(\eta\) = 1.5 and 4.8% for \(\eta\) = 0. Assuming that it is possible to know the longitudinal profile of the damage, each of the four longitudinal sectors can be calibrated. In this case the light ratio in the first tile deviates by 1.1% and 1.8% from the calibration constant in the first sector (mean of 3 first tiles) for \(\eta\) = 0 and for \(\eta\) = 1.5 respectively.
