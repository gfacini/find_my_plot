**Abstract**

The ratio of the interaction lengths for pions and protons in ATLAS iron-scintillator tile hadron calorimeter was measured.

Measured value \(\lambda_{\pi}/\lambda_{p}\)= \(1.25\pm 0.01_{stat-0.01sy\,st}^{+0.04}\) is in a good agreement with the calculated value of 1.22.

The results are based on the data from the test beam in June-98, exactly 50, 80, 100 GeV pion data from \(\eta\)-scan.

Introduction

In the following text we concentrated on the measurement of the ratio of the pion and proton interaction lengths in Tile Calorimeter Module 0. [1]

The nuclear interaction length \(\lambda\) characterises the interactions in calorimeter; exactly it is the mean free path of particle between two inelastic interactions. This variable is different for various particles. It depends on the inelastic nuclear cross section \(\sigma\) like:

\[\lambda=\frac{A}{N_{A}\cdot\sigma\cdot\rho} \tag{1}\]

where \(A,\rho\) are the atomic weight and density of the target, \(N_{A}\) is the Avogadro number.

The interaction length for pions and protons in TileCa1 was calculated in [2]:

\begin{tabular}{l l} pions: & \(\lambda_{\pi}\) =251 mm \\ protons: & \(\lambda_{p}\)=206 mm \\  & \(\lambda_{\pi}/\lambda_{p}\)=1.22 \\ \end{tabular}

## 2 Reconstruction of the ratio of the pion and proton interaction lengths

The ratio of the pion and proton interaction lengths in TileCa1 Module 0 was reconstructed using the test beam data from July-1998.

### Cuts

1. The single particles events were chosen using the response of the scintillating counters _s1cou, s2cou, s3cou_.
2. Muons was excluded from analysis using the cut on the energy deposited in Module 0.
3. Protons and pions were separated using the response of the Cherenkov counter _cherI_.

### Method

Module 0 is divided into read-out cells (see figure 1).

To reconstruct the ratio of the interaction lengths the following variables were measured (see figure 2) separately for pions and protons :

_N\({}_{o}\)_ - number of all incoming particles

After applying cuts the total number \(N_{o}\) of incoming particles of one type was read.

_N - number of non-interacting particles in the first sampling:_

For its estimation the spectrum of the energy, deposited in the cell which was irradiated, was used. Example of this energy spectrum is shown in figure 3.

The peak at low energies corresponds to particles which didn't interact inside the first sampling. The higher energies correspond to events when incoming particle began the shower inside the first sampling.

\(x(\lambda)\) - thickness of the first sampling:

From measured \(N\), \(N_{o}\) the thickness of the first sampling (expressed in interaction length) was calculated using the equation:

\[N\,=N_{o}\cdot\exp{(-x(\lambda))}\Rightarrow x(\lambda)=\ln{(\frac{N_{o}}{N})}\]

From the thicknesses of the first sampling the ratio \(\lambda_{\pi}/\lambda_{p}\) of the pion and proton interaction lengths can be calculated using the equation (2)

\[\frac{\lambda_{\pi}}{\lambda_{p}}=\frac{x(\lambda_{p})}{x(\lambda_{\pi})} \tag{2}\]

where

\(x(\lambda_{p})\) is the thickness of the first sampling expressed in the interaction lengths

\(x(\lambda_{\pi})\) is the thickness of the first sampling expressed in the interaction lengths of pions.

## 3 Results

Module 0 was irradiated at various pseudorapidities:

\[\eta = \mbox{-0.15, -0.25, -0.35, -0.45, -0.55, -0.65, -0.75}\] \[\mbox{+ fine $\eta$-scan (-0.34, -0.37, -0.40, -0.43, -0.46, -0.49, -0.53)}\]

Energies of particles were: \(50,\ 80,\ 100\) GeV

The results of thickness of the first sampling \(x(\lambda,\eta)\) expressed in the interaction length for various eta are shown in figure 4.

The function (3)(described in appendix A) expresses the dependence of the thickness of the first sampling on the pseudorapidity. Using this function the thickness of the first sampling for \(\eta\)=0 was calculated.

\[x(\lambda,\eta=0)=x(\lambda,\eta)\cdot\sin\left(2\cdot\arctan\left(\exp\left( -\eta\right)\right)\right) \tag{3}\]

The results of the thickness \(x(\lambda,\eta=0)\) of the first sampling are shown in figure 5 and in table 1. The ratio of the interaction length \(\lambda_{\pi}/\lambda_{p}\) was calculated using the equation (2).

## 4 Influences on the results of the measurement of the thickness of the first sampling

### The efficiency of the Cherenkov counter

We separated pions from protons using the response of the Cherenkov counter, which was set to the \(\pi/p\) threshold.

We tried to estimate the inefficiency of the Cherenkov counter to pions using the response of muons in this counter. For estimation of the number of pions with no signal in Cherenkov we used the following equation:

\[N_{\pi n}=N_{\pi s}\cdot\frac{N_{\mu n}}{N_{\mu s}}\]

where

\(N_{\pi\,s}\),\(N_{\mu s}\) is the number of pions, muons causing the signal in Cherenkov counter \(N_{\pi n}\),\(N_{\mu n}\) is the number of pions, muons after which passing through was no signal in Cherenkov counter.

We calculated \(N_{\pi n}\) for each ntuple and corrected the measured value of the thickness of the first sampling expressed in \(\lambda_{p}\) using the equation (4) (described in appendix C):

Figure 3: The energy deposited by hadrons in the first calorimeter sampling\[x^{\prime}(\lambda_{p})-x(\lambda_{p})=-\ln(\varepsilon_{\pi}\cdot e^{-(x(\lambda_{ \pi})-x(\lambda_{p}))}+1-\varepsilon_{\pi}) \tag{4}\]

where \(x^{\prime}(\lambda_{p})\) are the corrected values of the measurement of the thickness of the first sampling; \(\varepsilon_{\pi}\) expresses the amount of the admixture-pions in protons.

In table 1 there are shown already corrected values \(x(\lambda_{p})\).

### Kaons

The hadronic part of the beam is the mixture of protons, pions and kaons. Using the Cherenkov counters it was not possible to identify kaons in the beam. However we were able to estimate if kaons produced light in Cherenkov counter (described in appendix D).

From _cher1_ settings one can conclude that kaons produced light only in ntuples from fine \(\eta\)-scan.

We calculated the corrections to results of the measurement of the thickness of the first sampling with the assumption that about 5% of hadrons are kaons (the amount of pions is approximately same as the amount of protons). The interaction length for kaons in Module 0 was estimated to be 315 mm (appendix B).

These corrections (systematic errors) are shown in table 1.

### Cut on the energy

We calculated the thickness of the first sampling for two different cuts on the energy _em0_ deposited in Module 0.

cut 1 : _em0_ \(>\)\(E_{min}\)

\(E_{min}\) = 10 GeV for 50 GeV

\(E_{min}\) = 20 GeV for 80, 100 GeV

cut 2 : _em0_ \(\rangle\) - 2 \(\cdot\sigma\) < _em0_ \(<\) _em0_ \(\rangle+2\cdot\sigma\)

In table 1 there are shown the results of the measurement for both cuts. From these two measurements we calculated the averaged value (see table 2) as the result value and the deviation we included into the systematic error.

It should be noticed, however, that the ratio of \(\lambda_{\pi}/\lambda_{p}\) is the same for both methods.

Conclusions

We measured the thickness of the first sampling in TileCal Module 0 for pions and protons and calculated the ratio of their interaction lengths.

For this measurement we used 50, 80, 100 GeV pion and proton data from \(\eta\)-scan of Module 0 in July 1998.

The calculated ratio of the interaction length of pions and protons in TileCal Module 0 is shown in table 2 and compared with relevant value calculated in [2].
