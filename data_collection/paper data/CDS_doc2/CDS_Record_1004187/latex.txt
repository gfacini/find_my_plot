###### Abstract

We have determined the electromagnetic calibration constants of 11% TileCal modules exposed to electron beams with incident angles of 20\({}^{\circ}\) and 90\({}^{\circ}\). The gain of all the calorimeter cells have been pre-equalized using the radioactive Cs-source that will be also used in situ. The average values for these modules are equal to: for the flat filter method 1.154\(\pm\)0.002 pC/GeV and 1.192\(\pm\)0.002 pC/GeV for 20\({}^{\circ}\) and 90\({}^{\circ}\), for the fit method 1.040\(\pm\)0.002 pC/GeV and 1.068\(\pm\)0.003 pC/GeV, respectively. These average values for all cells of calibrated modules agree with the weighted average calibration constants for separate modules within the errors. Using the individual calibration constants for every module the RMS spread value of constants will be 1.9\(\pm\)0.1%. In the case of the global constant this value will be 2.6\(\pm\)0.1%. Finally, we present the global constants which should be used for the electromagnetic calibration of the ATLAS Tile hadronic calorimeter data in the ATHENA framework. These constants are equal to 1.15 pC/GeV in the case of the flat filter method and 1.04 pC/GeV for the fit one.

Introduction

The constructed ATLAS detector at the LHC will have the huge physics discovery potential, in particular in the detection of a heavy Higgs boson [1, 2]. Calorimeters will play a crucial role in it. The key question of calorimetry is the absolute energy calibration, in particular the calibration in the electromagnetic energy scale.

The physics goals have led to the following requirement for the knowledge of the absolute scale of energy: in the case of hadronic jets, the scale should be known to an accuracy of 1% [3].

The other important issue is the energy linearity. The most stringent linearity requirements for the hadronic calorimeter come from the study of quark compositeness where the jet energy scale has to be linear within 1.5% up to the transverse energy of 4 TeV [2, 4].

For each cell of the ATLAS hadronic TileCal calorimeter [5] the calibration constants, which define the relationship between the calorimeter signals, expressed in picoCoulombs, and the energy of the absorbed particles, which produced the signals, must be determined. The calibration constants depend on the type of particle, or jet and, generally speaking, on their energies [6]. This means that calibration constants determined for one particular type of particle, or jet of one particular energy lead to systematic mis-measurements of energy if used for the interpretation of signals caused by other particles, or jets of other energies.

It is assumed that for the ATLAS calorimeters the hadronic final states physics objects (hadrons, jets, missing transverse energy) should be reconstructed at first using calorimeter signals on an electromagnetic energy scale [7, 8].

With the aim of establishing of this scale and understanding of performance of the ATLAS Tile hadronic calorimeter [5] to electrons 11% of modules have been exposed in electron beams with various energies by three possible ways: cell-scan at \(\theta=20^{\circ}\) at the centers of the front face cells, \(\eta\)-scan and tilero scan at \(\theta=90^{\circ}\) for the module side cells.

Our work is devoted to summary of the electromagnetic calibration constants of TileCal modules at \(20^{\circ}\) and \(90^{\circ}\) obtained by us and presented in the following talks and notes [9] - [20].

The obtained calibration constants have been included in the TileCal calibration database and will be used for the energy calibration of the ATLAS Tile hadronic calorimeter.

Besides our works there are ones in which the electromagnetic calibration constants of TileCal modules at 20\({}^{\circ}\) and 90\({}^{\circ}\) for some testbeam runs have been determined [21] - [25].

## 2 The ATLAS Hadron Tile Calorimeter

The ATLAS Hadron Tile Calorimeter (TileCal) is a 2900 t sampling calorimeter using iron as passive material and tiles of scintillator as active material readout by wavelength shifting fibers [5]. This calorimeter will play a very important role to identify jets, measure their energy and direction, reconstruct the transverse missing energy. The goal of the TileCal is to measure hadrons energy with good resolution (\(\sigma/E=50\%\sqrt{GeV}/\sqrt{E}\oplus 3\%\)) and linearity (1 - 2% up to TeV scale).

An innovative feature of this calorimeter is the orientation of the scintillators that are placed in planes perpendicular to the colliding beams (Fig. 1 (left)). This disposition simplifies the tile-fiber and fiber-PMT coupling reducing the dead spaces of the calorimeter and hence increasing hermecity. Due to this feature we can get an hermetic coverage up to \(\mid\eta\mid=1.7\) (\(\mid\eta\mid=5\) with forward calorimeters), very important for the reconstruction of the transverse missing energy.

The TileCal is divided into one barrel and two extended barrel sections. All three sections have a cylindrical structure with an inner radius of 2280 mm and outer one of 4230 mm. The barrel section is 5460 mm in length along the beam axis, while each extended barrel has a length of about 2910 mm. Each of the cylinders is further subdivided into 64 independent azimuthally oriented modules. Within each module, there are a number of readout cells. Each cell is a set of scintillating tiles connected by fibers to 2 PMTs. The TileCal will contain 4672 cells which will be read-out by 9344 PMTs. Two fibres collect light from every scintillator tile at both of its azimuthal edges. The total number of tiles is 456000.

The calorimeter is divided in \(\eta\) towers, which are "pseudo-projective" towards the interaction region, and radially segmented in three depths. The thicknesses of depths at \(\eta=0\) are 1.5 \(\lambda\) in the first sampling, 4.2 \(\lambda\) in the second one, and 1.9 \(\lambda\) in the third one, with a total depth of 7.6 \(\lambda\). The granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi\) at \(\eta=0\) is 0.1\(\times\)0.1 for the first two depths and 0.2\(\times\)0.1 in the third compartment.

The iron structure of each module consists of a number of repeated periods (Fig. 1 (right)). Each period is 18 mm thick and consists of four layers. The first and third layers are formed by large trapezoidal steel plates (master plates), and spanning the full longitudinal dimension of the module. In the second and fourth layers, smaller trapezoidal steel plates (spacer plates) and scintillator tiles alternate. These layers consist of 11 different trapezoids of steel and scintillator, each spanning from 97 to 187 mm. The master plates, spacer plates and scintillator tiles are of 5 mm, 4 mm and 3 mm thick, respectively. The iron to scintillator ratio is 4.67:1 by volume.

## 3 Test Beam Setup

Fig. 2 shows the used test beam setup. The Barrel Module 0 is the bottom module mounted on the table. The middle layer is the production barrel module BM. The top layer is the two extended barrel modules: EBM\(+\) for \(\eta>0\) (beam left) and EBM\(-\) for \(\eta<0\) (beam right).

The layout of the cell geometry is demonstrated in Fig. 3. Each cell

Figure 1: Principle of the TileCal (left). Exploded view of an assembled TileCal period (right).

is a set of scintillating tiles connected by fibers to 2 PMTs. Each module is read out in three longitudinal layers. The first layer consists of A-cells, the second one -- of B- and C-cells, and the third one -- of D-cells. In \(\eta\), the readout cells, built by grouping fibres into PMTs, are "pseudo-projective" towards the interaction region. There are 11 transverse rows of tiles (tilerows) in a module. For a barrel module A-cells have tilerows 1\(\div\)3, B- and C-cells -- 4\(\div\)7, D-cells -- 8\(\div\)11. For a extended barrel module A-cells have tilerows 1\(\div\)3, B- and C-cells -- 4\(\div\)7, D-cells -- 8\(\div\)11.

## 4 PMT signal reconstruction methods

For obtaining of the channel response the registered PMT signals are treated by two methods: the flat filter and fit ones [26, 27]. The response of the flat filter method, \(R_{flat}\), is an integral, a maximum of all possible sums of 5 subsequent samples of the pulse shape of a PMT signal which is sampled 9 times with the 25 ns interval

\[R_{flat}=C_{cis}\cdot\max\left(\sum_{i=j}^{j+4}(s_{i}-s_{1})\right). \tag{1}\]

The first sample (\(s_{1}\)) is considered as a pedestal and its value is subtracted from all other samples (\(s_{i}\)). Here \(C_{cis}\) is the constant transforming the

Figure 2: Sketch of the test beam setup.

ADC values into pC derived from CIS (Charge Injection System) events, \(j=1,\ \dots,\ 5\). As a consequence of finding the maximum, the flat filter method exhibits positive offset for the pedestal-like events. For majority of PMTs this offset, \(\langle R_{noise}\rangle\), and \(RMS_{noise}\) do not exceed 0.016 pC and 0.06 pC, correspondingly, amounts to 0.01 pC and 0.05 pC, in average, as can be seen in Fig. 4. But there are tails, 11% PMTs are with larger noise. Because of this, at using the method of cutting noise (in which the PMT channel signal is set equal to 0 if the value of signal less than \(Cut_{noise}\) value, with a typical value of 0.1 pC) the calibration constants at low energies (10 - 20 GeV) become dependent from a value of \(Cut_{noise}\).

Figure 3: The layout of the cell geometry.

as shown in Fig. 4 (bottom). The data at high energy are insensitive to the value of \(Cut_{noise}\), as expected.

We have devised the following algorithm correcting this defect. If the value of signal less than \(3\cdot RMS_{noise,i}\) then the one is decreased on the value of \(\langle R_{noise,i}\rangle\). So, we obtain unbias values of \(\langle R_{noise,i}\rangle\).

The fit method is based on fitting the pulse shape function, f (t), to samples (\(s_{i}\)) of event

\[f(t)=R_{fit}\cdot g(t-\tau)+ped, \tag{2}\]

where \(g(t-\tau)\) is the known normalized pulse shape function, \(t\) is time, \(\tau\) is the phase (peak position in time), \(ped\) is a pedestal. So, the reconstructed response, \(R_{fit}\), is the amplitude of the PMT signal. The fit method results only in a very small offset (typical values are 0.0002 pC per PMT) and smaller spread, \(\langle RMS_{noise,i}\rangle\) is 0.02 pC.

## 5 Data analysis

### Calibration volume

The area used for reconstructing the electron energy for both the \(20^{\circ}\) and \(90^{\circ}\) runs, was one TileCal extended barrel module or half barrel module, since the electron calibration constants are used for the hadron energy reconstruction [28, 29]. These calorimeter volumes have a number of cells similar to the amount of cells that we use to reconstruct an hadronic shower [30]. Given the fact that the electron beam was incident in the center of each cell for \(20^{\circ}\) runs or of the each tile row for \(90^{\circ}\) runs, there was no lateral leakage due to the fact that one module was used for the energy estimation. Even though a larger area than the shower extent was used, the volume that was used for electron energy reconstruction was that of one cell, since more than 90% of the electron shower is contained in one cell. Each cell contributes with about 30 MeV of electronics noise (fit method), having no impact on the calibration constants. The cells calibrated, due to the electromagnetic shower longitudinal size, are the A-layer cells (\(20^{\circ}\) beams) and the cells on the Z-edge of the modules (\(90^{\circ}\) beams) for each module, representing approximately 50% of the module's readout cells.

The electron calibration constants, \(C_{e}\), for the A+1 cell of BM+ (JINR-55) at \(\theta=20^{\circ}\) for 10 and 180 GeV as a function of \(Cut_{noise}\) value (bottom).

### Electron selection

The H8 electron beams at the SPS CERN are the mixture of electrons, muons and hadrons. For calibration it is important to have the pure electron beam. We have estimated that in order to have the systematic error in the electron calibration constant due to the pion contamination smaller than 0.3% this contamination must be smaller than 1.5% in the energy range of 10 - 300 GeV [31]. Therefore, we have performed the identification of (\(e\), \(\mu\), \(\pi\)) particles on the basis of the calorimetric information. We have used the following three selection criteria [31].

#### 5.2.1 Selection with longitudinal shower energy deposition

The first selection criterion

\[C_{i}=\sum_{selected\ i}\ \sum_{k=1}^{2}\sum_{l=1}^{2}E_{ikl}/E_{beam}, \tag{3}\]

is a value of the relative shower energy deposition in the first two calorimeter depths, where \(E_{ikl}\) is the energy response of an \(ikl\) PMT, \([E_{ikl}]=\) pC, \(k\) is a depth number, \(i\) is a cell number in the \(k\)-depth, \(l=1,\ 2\) is the PMT number in the \(ik\) cell, \([C_{i}]=\) pC/GeV.

The basis for this electron-hadron separation is the different longitudinal energy deposition for electrons and hadrons. For example, if a 100 GeV particle crosses 45 cm of the Tile calorimeter from the front face it corresponds to 18 radiation lengths or 2.2 nuclear interaction lengths. The amount of the deposited energy is equal to 95% for the electromagnetic shower and only 50% for the hadronic shower [32].

Fig. 5 (left) shows the typical \(C_{i}\) distributions. The left peak corresponds to the pion events, the right peak corresponds to the electron events.

#### 5.2.2 Selection using lateral shower energy deposition

The second selection criterion is related with the lateral shower spread

\[E_{cut}=\frac{\sqrt{\sum_{c}(E_{c}^{\alpha}-\sum_{c}E_{c}^{\alpha}/N_{cell})^{ 2}}}{\sum_{c}E_{c}^{\alpha}}\, \tag{4}\]

where \(1\leq c\leq N_{cell}\), \(N_{cell}\) is the used cells number, \(\alpha=0.6\). For example, for the 100 GeV hadronic shower the 99% containment radius is equal to 430 mm, but for the electromagnetic shower the one is equal to 70 mm.

Fig. 5 (center) shows the typical \(E_{cut}\) distributions. The left peak corresponds to the pion events, the right peak corresponds to the electron events. Fig. 5 (right) shows the scatter plot of \(E_{cut}\) versus \(C_{i}\). The top right region are the electron events, the bottom left region are the pion events. These Figures allow to determine the values of the cuts and to estimate the contaminations.

We have estimated by extrapolation of the fitted pion peak curve to the region of the electron peak (Figs. 5) that the contamination of the pion events in the electron events does not exceed the 0.2% level [31].

#### 5.2.3 Rejection of muons

For the muon rejection at energies \(E_{beam}\geq 10\) GeV we have used the cut in the total deposited energy: \(E_{tot}>E_{min}\) with \(E_{min}=5\) GeV [33]. This cut effectively selects muons as muons loose a very small fraction of their energy in the calorimeter.

#### 5.2.4 Electrons selection using Cherenkov counter

At energies \(\leq 20\) GeV there is a bad selection of electrons by the \(C_{i}\) and \(E_{cut}\) criteria. This situation is greatly improved by using the first Cherenkov counter signal (cut 3).

Fig. 5 (bottom) shows the typical scatter plots of \(E_{cut}\) versus \(\tilde{\rm C}_{1}\) and \(C_{i}\) versus \(\tilde{\rm C}_{1}\). As seen, electrons (left) are well selected.

#### 5.2.5 Resultant cuts

We have used the following three cuts for the electron selection [31]: the cut 1 is \(C_{i}>0.9\div 1.1\), the cut 2 is \(E_{cut}>0.07\div 0.14\), the cut 3 is \(\tilde{\rm C}_{1}>200\div 400\).

Due to these cuts we have obtained the clean sample of the electron events for the calibration of modules of the TileCal.

### Tilecal electron response

The electron response in our calorimeter is a function of a beam energy, and an incidence angle, and an impact point [34].

The energy response spectrum for given run (beam has the transversal spread \(\pm 15\) mm) as a rule is non-Gaussian as can be seen in Fig. 6.

Figure 6: The relative electron energy distributions (pC/GeV for \(E=10\) GeV at \(\theta=20^{\circ}\) (top-left) and for \(E=20\) GeV at \(\eta=-0.15\) (top-right). The normalized electron response (\(E_{e}/E_{beam}\)) for \(E=20\) GeV as a function of impact point \(Z\) coordinate (bottom).

The mean normalized electron responses as a function of an impact point \(Z\) coordinate for A-cells and \(\eta\) scans are described by the sine function (Fig. 6, bottom):

\[f(Z)=P_{2}+P_{1}\sin\left(2\pi Z/P_{3}+P_{4}\right) \tag{5}\]

Electromagnetic calibration of TileCal

The summary of the numerical values of the average electromagnetic calibration constants and RMS of TileCal 19 modules (ANL-03, ANL-08, ANL-23, ANL-27, ANL-30, ANL-44, IFA-09, IFA-15, IFA-24, IFA-27, IFA-42, IFA-9, JINR-01, JINR-12, JINR-13, JINR-27, JINR-34, JINR-55, JINR-63) is given in the Tables 6 and 7 in Appendix A.

For 90\({}^{\circ}\) runs, the results are presented both with the default Cs calibration (Default) and also with the individual tilerow corrections (Corrected). In the former case a Cs correction factor averaging the responses of all tile rows in a cell is applied, whereas in the latter each tile row response is corrected by its individual Cs correction factor. The difference is further discussed in Section 7.

All the modules (11%) have been analysed with flat filter method. For historical reasons only a part of modules have also been analysed with the fit method (in 2002, 2003). In addition, all this analysis is performed without ANL-03 module in cell-scan (Test beam June 2003) due to problems in Cs-calibration in this particular case.

Let us first compare the performance with two above mentioned energy reconstruction methods with the same modules, therefore at limited statistics (see Section 6.1). Next, the full statistics results are presented for the flat filter (see Section 6.2). The overall Tile calorimeter performance with electrons in terms of the uniformity and the response angular dependence is then discussed in Sections 7 and 7.3.

### Comparison of the Flat and Fit methods results

As already mentioned above, results presented in this Section involve only 3 testbeam periods (TB-07-2002, TB-06-2003 and first part of TB-07-2003), where both flat filter and fit method analysis were performed. Thus, these results represent limited statistics. Fig. 7 and Table 2 present the average and RMS values for the electromagnetic calibration constants with two reconstruction methods (the flat filter and the fit methods) using the July 2002, June 2003 and fist period of July 2003 test beam data for all modules at 20\({}^{\circ}\) with the default Cesium calibration and with the individual tilerow correction at 90\({}^{\circ}\) using the Cesium calibration system (see Section 7.1 for more details). The same results for separate type of modules ANL, IFA, JINR are presented in the Table 3.

Figure 9: The distributions of the electromagnetic calibration constants at \(\theta=90^{\circ}\) obtained using the flat filter method for JINR, ANL, IFA and all modules (bottom-right) at the full statistics.

The mean calibration constant and RMS for all modules amounts to \(1.154\pm 0.002\) pC/GeV and \(2.6\pm 0.1\%\) for the \(20^{\circ}\) electron beams. The RMS values for individual module families are shown in Table 4. The worse uniformity of ANL modules for \(20^{\circ}\) electron beam is due to the way the tiles were pre-selected for the module instrumentation3.

Footnote 3: The best quality tiles were used in the barrel modules, the medium quality ones in IFA modules. The tiles used in ANL modules thus represent the lower tail of optical quality with bigger spread, which corresponds to worse RMS.

### Weighted averages for individual modules

The distributions of the average electromagnetic calibration constants for the fit method at \(20^{\circ}\) and \(90^{\circ}\) as a function of a module are shown in Fig. 10 (limited statistics).

Fig. 10 (top) demonstrates the mean electromagnetic calibration constants for separate modules for the fit method at \(20^{\circ}\) as a function of a module number. The weighted average value is equal to \(1.033\pm 0.004\) pC/GeV, the upper spread is \(0.5\%\), the lower one is \(2.6\%\) (without the ANL-03 module).

Fig. 10 (bottom) shows the mean electromagnetic calibration constants for separate modules for the fit method at \(90^{\circ}\) as a function of a module. The weighted average value is equal to \(1.068\pm 0.005\) pC/GeV, the upper spread is \(3.3\%\), the lower one is \(3.4\%\).

The distributions of the weighted average electromagnetic calibration constants for the flat filter method at \(20^{\circ}\) and \(90^{\circ}\) as a function of a module are shown in Fig. 11.

Fig. 11 (top) demonstrates the mean electromagnetic calibration constants for separate modules for the flat filter method at \(20^{\circ}\) as a function of a module. The weighted average value is equal to \(1.153\pm 0.003\) pC/GeV, the upper spread is \(1.6\%\), the lower one is \(3.0\%\) (without the ANL-03 module).

Fig. 11 (bottom) shows the mean electromagnetic calibration constants for separate modules for the flat filter method at \(90^{\circ}\) as a function of a module without (circles) and with the individual Cs tilero correction (squares). The weighted average value is equal to \(1.196\pm 0.003\) pC/GeV, the upper spread is \(2.2\%\), the lower one is \(4.7\%\).

For determining of the weighted average values we have fitted these distributions by straight lines.

(N is the number of experimental points) we increase the error obtained from the fit by a scale factor S defined as \(S=\sqrt{\chi^{2}/(N-1)}\) according to the procedure given in Review of Particle Physics [37]. So, the weighted average values for all modules agree with the average calibration constants for separate modules within the errors.

Summary of the weighted average values of electromagnetic calibration constants extracted from Figs. 10, 11 are given in Table 5.

The calibration constants for \(90^{\circ}\) are larger than the corresponding ones for \(20^{\circ}\). This is explained by the transition effect [18, 40]. The \(90^{\circ}/20^{\circ}\) ratios are equal to \(1.036\pm 0.004\) and \(1.034\pm 0.006\) for the flat and fit methods.

The calibration constants for the flat method are greater than the corresponding ones for the fit method. The flat/fit ratios are equal to \(1.116\pm 0.005\) and \(1.119\pm 0.006\) for \(20^{\circ}\) and \(90^{\circ}\). Using these values it is possible to transfer constants obtained by one method to corresponding constants obtained by other method.

## 7 Uniformity

The electromagnetic calibration constants, as obtained during all test-beam periods, were presented in Sections 6.1 and 6.2. The uniformity issues are addressed in this Section.

### Uniformity at \(20^{\circ}\) and \(90^{\circ}\)

The RMS of the electromagnetic calibration constants at \(90^{\circ}\) with default Cs calibration is bigger than that at \(20^{\circ}\) (see Table 7 in Appendix A).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(\Theta\) & Flat Method & Fit Method & Flat/Fit \\ \hline \(20^{\circ}\) & 1.153\(\pm\)0.003 & 1.033\(\pm\)0.004 & 1.116\(\pm\)0.005 \\ \hline \(90^{\circ}\) & 1.195\(\pm\)0.003 & 1.068\(\pm\)0.005 & 1.119\(\pm\)0.006 \\ \hline \(90^{\circ}/20^{\circ}\) & 1.036\(\pm\)0.004 & 1.034\(\pm\)0.006 & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

This difference reflects the cell readout structure. Since the electromagnetic showers initiated by \(20^{\circ}\) electron beams hit all tilerows in the impact cells, the tilerow-to-tilerow variations are averaged over in the sum. This is not the case of the \(90^{\circ}\) beams, where only the impact tilerow contributes to the measured signal.

The Cs calibration correction are applied to account for the tilerow-to-tilerow response variations in a cell for the \(90^{\circ}\) beams. The following formula is used:

\[R_{e}^{corr}=R_{e}\cdot\frac{A_{mean}}{A_{i}}\, \tag{6}\]

where \(R_{e}\) (\(R_{e}^{corr}\)) is an electromagnetic calibration constant for given tilerow with the default cesium calibration (with the individual tilerow correction). \(A_{mean}\) is the mean amplitude of the cesium calibration for given cell, \(A_{i}\) is the amplitude of the cesium calibration for given tilerow in a cell, \(i=1,\ n\), where \(n\) is a number of tilerow in a cell. The values of \(A_{i}\) were taken from the TileCal Cs-calibration data base [35]. The changes of the average calibration constants after this correction are small. However, the RMS improves when the individual tilerow corrections are applied (see Section 7.1.1).

#### 7.1.1 Example of an impact of the individual tilerow

Cs-corrections

Let us demonstrate the impact of the individual tilerow Cs-corrections for the module JINR-34 as an example. Fig. 12 shows the distributions of the electromagnetic calibration constants for the flat filter method for this module at 20 and 180 GeV at \(90^{\circ}\). One can see the larger spread of the constants (\(\mathrm{RMS}=3.4\pm 0.5\%\)) in the negative part of the module in comparison with the positive part (\(\mathrm{RMS}=1.5\pm 0.2\%\)). After applying the above-mentioned corrections the spreads became equal within the errors -- \(1.9\pm 0.3\%\) and \(1.6\pm 0.2\%\), respectively (see Table 7 in Appendix A).

#### 7.1.2 Uniformity at the module level

Let us demonstrate the module-to-module uniformity using the averages of calibrations constants obtained at \(20^{\circ}\) and \(90^{\circ}\). Keep in mind that the results for fit method involve only limited statistics (approximatelyFigure 12: The electromagnetic calibration constants for JINR-34 (TB-06-2002) at 20 GeV (top) and 180 GeV (bottom) at 90\({}^{\circ}\) as a function of a tilrow number for the flat filter method [11]. The open circles are calibration constants with the default Cs calibration, the open squares – with the individual Cs tilrow correction.

one half of all 11% modules tested with beams) as already mentioned in Section 6.1.

The RMS values of the electromagnetic calibration constants for the flat filter method at \(20^{\circ}\) and \(90^{\circ}\) as a function of a module number are given in Table 6 and shown in the Fig. 13. The RMS values at \(20^{\circ}\) in average equal to \(1.9\pm 0.1\%\) and are systematically smaller than those at \(90^{\circ}\) (average equal to \(2.7\pm 0.2\%\)).

The RMS values for the electromagnetic calibration constants for the fit method at \(20^{\circ}\) and \(90^{\circ}\) as a function of a module number are shown on the Fig. 14. The RMS values at \(20^{\circ}\) in average equal to \(2.1\pm 0.2\%\) and are systematically smaller than those at \(90^{\circ}\) (average equal to \(3.1\pm 0.3\%\)). These results at limited statistics agree with those obtained with flat filter at full statistics.

#### 7.1.3 Uniformity at the cell level

The summary of the cell-to-cell uniformity can be deduced from the Tables 2 (fit method, limited statistics) and 4 (flat filter, full statistics).

Figure 13: The RMS (%) values of the electromagnetic calibration constants for the flat filter method at \(20^{\circ}\) (black stars) and a \(90^{\circ}\) (open circles – with the default Cs calibration, open squares – with the individual Cs tilero correction) as a function of a module number.

The same quantities can also be derived from Figures 7, 8, 9.

Taking into account only the results with full statistics, the uniformity amounts to \(2.6\pm 0.1\%\) at \(20^{\circ}\) and \(3.9\pm 0.1\%\) at \(90^{\circ}\) (after the individual tilerow Cs-corrections).

The results shown in Table 7 (see Appendix A) clearly indicate that the individual tilerow Cs-corrections have an appreciable effect on the resulting RMS only in the barrel modules (JINR: RMS = \(2.2\pm 0.2\%\)), but not in extended barrel ones (ANL: RMS = \(4.2\pm 0.4\%\), IFA: RMS = \(4.1\pm 0.4\%\)). The worse correlation electron/cesium in the extended barrel modules can be explained by the fact that extended barrel modules have much deeper cells (as seen at \(90^{\circ}\)) and the electromagnetic shower reaches only part of the cell. The cell non-uniformities due to optics and instrumentation effects are only partially seen by electrons (the electron shower extends to a part of the cell), while the cesium takes into account all the tiles inside the cell.

#### 7.1.4 Interpretation of RMS values

The results of the instrumentation of the TileCal production modules are summarized in Ref. [36]. The reported average tile-to-tile non-uniformity for barrel modules amounts to approximately \(\mathrm{RMS_{unif}}=6\%\).

According to [37], 90% of the electromagnetic shower energy is contained inside of a cylinder with the Moliere radius \(R_{M}\). In our case \(R_{M}=20.5\) mm [38] and a period of the calorimeter containing one scintillator tile is 18 mm. The most of an electromagnetic shower passes only \(N=6\) tiles from typically 48 available in an A-cell. Thus, \(\mathrm{RMS}=\frac{\mathrm{RMS_{unif}}}{\sqrt{N}}=2.4\%\). This number should be compared with the measured non-uniformity for \(20^{\circ}\) electron beams \(\mathrm{RMS}=2.6\pm 0.1\%\).

#### 7.1.5 Comparison with muons results

The non-uniformity observed with electrons at \(90^{\circ}\) can be compared to that observed with muons.

Fig. 15 (left) shows the mean muon response over all tilerow segments without individual tilerow correction. In this

Figure 15: Left: Muon response over all tile row segments with RMS equal to 4% [39]. Right: Muon signal corrected to Cs for individual tile row responses in a given cell with RMS equal to 3% [39].

case the RMS is equal to 4% [39]. Fig. 15 (right) shows the mean muon response over all tilerow segments with individual tilerow correction. In this case the RMS is equal to 3% [39]. As can be seen from Fig. 15 (right) and Fig. 14 the RMS spreads for muons and electrons are similar only for barrel modules. Unlike electrons, no major difference is observed between muon/Cs in barrel modules (smaller cells) and extended barrel modules (large cells), since both muon and Cs signals are integrated along whole cell.

### Asymmetry of the positive and negative parts of barrel modules

We have investigated the asymmetry of the negative (\(\eta<0\)) and positive (\(\eta>0\)) parts of barrel modules. The results, the differences \(\Delta_{em}\) between the corresponding calibration constants, are shown in Fig. 16. As one can see, these differences are equal to 0 within the errors. So, the asymmetry in calibration constants is absent.

### Angular effect

The electron calibration constants obtained with the flat filter method at \(90^{\circ}\) are systematically higher than those obtained at \(20^{\circ}\) by about 3.5% (see Table 4). Therefore, the dependence of the electron response on the impact angle were studied in more detail.

The \(\eta\)-projective electron data were used for this purpose. As shown in Fig. 17, the electromagnetic calibration constant increases with the impact angle. The experimental data match the Monte-Carlo results and suggest that the dependence is due to the transition effect [18, 40]. In particular, it explains the difference between the calibration constants at \(20^{\circ}\) and \(90^{\circ}\). The electron calibration constants are well described by the formula:

\[R_{exp}=(1.068\pm 0.012)+(0.028\pm 0.004)\cdot\log{(\Theta)}. \tag{7}\]

One can use eventually this formula for calibration constant as function of \(\Theta\) for correction of electron response at any different angles to \(\Theta=20^{\circ}\) level.

### Global calibration constant

The weighted average electromagnetic calibration constants from Table 5 coincide within the errors with the corresponding values obtained from the distributions of all electromagnetic calibration constants shown in Tables 4 (flat filter, full statistics) and 2 (fit method, limited statistics). Finally, we present the global constants which should be used for the electromagnetic calibration of the ATLAS Tile hadronic calorimeter data in the ATHENA framework [41]. These constants are equal to 1.15 in the case of the flat filter method and 1.04 for the fit one.

The GEANT4 (version 6.2) Monte-Carlo calculations for the TileCal test beam setup are indicated in open circles. The Monte-Carlo data normalized to \(90^{\circ}\) experimental result. The curve is the result of the fit experimental results by the formula (7).

### Comparison to pions response uniformity

The data from the different test beams have been used to look at the calorimeter hadronic response homogeneity after the modules have been intercalibrated with the Cs source. In this study [42] it is shown that the global uniformity of the TileCal modules is about \(1.2\pm 0.2\%\) over several \(\eta\) impact points (see Fig. 18). This result is in good agreement with uniformity for hadrons equal to \(1.4\pm 0.4\%\) presented in Ref. [43].

The uniformity for pions is much better than for electrons, since the hadronic shower are much extensive (broader and deeper) than the electromagnetic ones and thereby are not so sensitive to the discrete calorimeter structure as electromagnetic ones.

Conclusions

We have determined the electromagnetic calibration constants of 11% TileCal modules exposed to electron beams with incident angles of 20\({}^{\circ}\) and 90\({}^{\circ}\). The gain of all the calorimeter cells have been pre-equalized using the radioactive Cs-source that will be also used in situ. The average values for these modules are equal to: for the flat filter method 1.154\(\pm\)0.002 pC/GeV and 1.192\(\pm\)0.002 pC/GeV for 20\({}^{\circ}\) and 90\({}^{\circ}\), for the fit method 1.040\(\pm\)0.002 pC/GeV and 1.068\(\pm\)0.003 pC/GeV, respectively. These average values for all cells of calibrated modules agree with the weighted average calibration constants for separate modules within the errors. Using the individual calibration constants for every module the RMS spread value of constants will be 1.9\(\pm\)0.1%. In the case of the global constant this value will be 2.6\(\pm\)0.1%. Finally, we present the global constants which should be used for the electromagnetic calibration of the ATLAS Tile hadronic calorimeter data in the ATHENA framework. These constants are equal to 1.15 pC/GeV in the case of the flat filter method and 1.04 pC/GeV for the fit one.
