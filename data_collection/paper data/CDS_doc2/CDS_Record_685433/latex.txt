The results of the 2001 SEE campaign on the HV distributor system of the TileCal showed that further tests were needed on HVopto boards to qualify production cards with respect to SEE occurences. New irradiations were thus performed at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Zurich-Switzerland) for that purpose. In this note are described the setup used, the fluences applied and the conclusions obtained.

Introduction

SEE tests on the High Voltage Distributor system of the TileCal were performed in 2001 [1] to qualify production cards. The conclusion was that among the two types of cards of the system, namely HVmicro and HVopto boards, the second could not be considered qualified with respect to SEE occurences (the way of dealing with SEEs and the impact on DCS and low voltages for HVmicro cards were extensively discussed in [2]): indeed, during 2001 tests, we found one component that we thought extremely sensitive to SEEs [1]. Because of lack of time, the solution found to replace this optocoupler was not tested according to ATLAS rules [3] (too small statistics). We thus made complementary SEE tests on the HVopto boards at the Paul Scherrer Institute on november 2,3 2002 to validate the solution found in 2001 and to irradiate components with statistics compliant with ATLAS TC rules. In this note are described the experimental setup used, the tests performed and the conclusions obtained.

## 2 Experimental setup

Irradiation were performed at the PIF facility [4] of the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) [5]. Protons of 250 MeV energy were used. For each run, a total fluence of 3.4e10 \(p.cm^{-2}\), which corresponds to the highest fluence (dose equivalent to ten years of ATLAS operations, safety factors included) for HVopto boards (see table 1 of [1]). It thus took 25 minutes per run depending on the fluences applied (see below). The diameter of the beam was of about 7 cm.

The setup used is given on figure 1. It is composed of an HVopto and an HVmicro boards laying on a PVC test bench located in the beam area. In the control room (signal are transmitted to the beam area through 50 meter cables), a PC is used to control the cards (through CANBUS), to set low and high voltages and to read multimeter data (all this though GPIB).

The HVmicro card is used to set orders and to read data from the HVopto board. It worked in the automatic mode and transmits, at a frequency of 2.6 Hz, three types of CANbus messages depending on the difference between the requested (transmitted on the HVopto cards though DACs) and the resulting high voltages (value given by HVopto regulation loops and digitized by ADCs):

* "M" type (Message): \(|HV_{DAC}-HV_{ADC}|<\) 0.5
* "W" type (Warning): 0.5*maxstep\(<|HV_{DAC}-HV_{ADC}|<\)maxstep
* "A" type (Alarm) : maxstep\(<|HV_{DAC}-HV_{ADC}|\)

where maxstep is the reference bound (each message contains an identifier, the channel number, the order requested and the applied value of this channel). For the tests, the maxsteps (one per channel) were defined in the following way: the same setup was used at Clermont and data were registered. Mean values and RMSes of \(<|HV_{DAC}-HV_{ADC}|\) were computed and maxsteps were taken to be these mean values added to five corresponding RMSes.

All messages of types "W" and "A" were automatically registered. To avoid overloading disks with data, "M" messages were registered every 30 seconds. Other quantities

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]

monitored were the low voltages (+15V, -15V and +5V) and their associated currents (registered every 2 to 5 seconds). On one test (see below) a multimeter was put on a given channel to give information on potential SEE occuring on this channel. All these results were followed on-line thanks to Labview [6] based programms.

Two types of irradiation were performed:

* "BRG" type: the corresponding irradiation area is given on figure 2: it includes the so-called ON/OFF structure and a regulation loop. The ON/OFF structure allows to switch On or Off half a HVopto card. During 2001 tests we saw [1] that one of its component (optocoupler MCT2) seemed to be too sensitive to SEEs to be used in ATLAS. It is now replaced by the MOC8204 (optocoupler already present in regulation loops). The component irradiated during these tests are given in table 1.
* "DAC" type: this irradiation is just a check (see figure 2): during 2001 tests, DACs were already irradiated. But the way used at that time is not the one of ATLAS (during tests, DACs were reloaded prior to applied high voltages reading: the DACs will be loaded once in ATLAS conditions). We thus performed a run to probe DACs in ATLAS conditions. The components irradiated during this run are given on table 1.

## 3 Results

### Test 1: "BRG" type

#### 3.1.1 Measurements

As stated above, regulation loops and ON/OFF systems are irradiated during this test. Two HVopto boards were used (numbers 150-020 and 150-021) and the HVmicro card number 151-001. The fluences applied during the tests as well as the channel tested are

given in table 2. For each irradiation a total flux of 3.4e10 \(p.cm^{-2}\) (which corresponds to ten years of ATLAS operations, safety factor included) was applied. A DAC order of 600V was set for all the considered channel.

On figure 3 are given results of channel 23 of HVopto card 150-020. The difference between DAC and ADC values (in V) as well as the multimeter measurement (for the same channel) are shown (versus time or histogram). One observes a high stability on the ON/OFF structure and on the regulation loops: the mean difference between DAC and ADC values if of -0.02 V and the RMS on the multimeter value is of 0.08V, that is at the 0.01% level.

Similar results were obtained for other runs as summarized in table 3.

The conclusion is that we did not see any SEU during irradiation of HVopto boards. Looking at low voltage currents is very useful to detect potential latch-ups. Typical distributions of low voltage and HV source values and their associated currents are given on figures 4 and 5 for the irradiation corresponding to channel 22 of HVopto board 150-021.

One did not observe any current peaks typical of latch ups. Similar were obtained for other irradiations. Table 4 summarizes the results obtained.

#### 3.1.2 An interesting result

Merely by chance, we found, by varying the fluence during one of our test, a result that we think is related to the problem seen during 2001 SEE tests. On figure 6 are displayed multimeter value as a function of the time (top) for HVopto card 150-020 channel 23 and the fluence applied during that time (bottom). It clearly appears that if the fluence

150-020 & 2.0e7 \(p.cm^{-2}.s^{-1}\) & 2.9e7 \(p.cm^{-2}.s^{-1}\) \\ \hline

applied is too high (typically 4.2e7 \(p.cm^{-2}.s^{-1}\) ), the output high voltage goes to 0 (and the same for all the channel of the odd side) and this is due to a saturation of the MOC8204 optocoupler acting in the ON/OFF structure. The same phenomena was seen last year for the MCT2 optocoupler. We thought, at that time, that it was highly sensitive to SEEs. But the results on figure 6 tend to show that it was more sensitive to the fluence applied.

This fluence dependency will not be a problem in ATLAS since it will be very small (we remind that we are applying in 20 minutes or so a total flux equivalent to ten years of ATLAS operations!).

### Test 2: "DAC" type

The goal of test 2 was a check on DACs. These components were already irradiated last year with no problems but the way we used them was different from the one in ATLAS: last year, DACs were systematically reloaded prior to ADC readings. In ATLAS, DACs will be loaded once (at the boot of the CPU). This difference could have hidden potential SEU (at a small rate though). The goal of test 2 was to check this. One run was performed to get a total flux of 3.4e10 \(p.cm^{-2}\) with a fluence of 3.9e7 \(p.cm^{-2}.s^{-1}\) (RMS:6%).The components involved are given on table 1. HVopto (HVmicro) card number 142-008 (151-001) was used. To avoid setting high voltage on the 24 channels and then reading them with a multimeter (loss of time), the regulation loops were shortened so that output DAC values were directly digitized by ADCs. DAC orders corresponding to 600V were set. The ADC distribution is given on figure 7.

One concludes from the mean value obtained that no SEU were seen since results are compatible with the resolution of the system (1 DAC and 1 ADC counts are worth as 0.2V). Furthermore, analysis of low voltage currents did not show any SEE effect.

We thus conclude that DACs are qualified with respect to SEE occurences.

## Conclusions

Final tests on the HVopto cards of the HV distributor system of the TileCal were

performed at PSI with protons of 250 MeV to complete the qualification of the production boards. The total flux applied, 3.4e10 \(p.cm^{-2}\), corresponds to ten years of ATLAS operations, safety factors included. From the results obtained, we conclude that ON/OFF structures, regulation loops and DACs are qualified in a way compliant with ATLAS TC rules: no SEE effects were observed.
