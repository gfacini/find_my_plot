###### Abstract

The efficiency for correctly observing a signal event in a TRT endcap sector prototype is measured as a function of the background rate. The impact on the results of both the signal and background pulse shapes is studied using electronically generated pulses. The results are then related to similar test beam data, and it is shown, that the efficiency can be adequately measured in the system-test laboratory using electronically generated pulses. Previous discrepancies between test-beam results and recent data acquired using a photon source in Israel are explained by the different energy spectra of the background pulses.

Introduction

A detailed understanding of the degradation of the performance, i.e. drift-time measurement efficiency and accuracy, as a function of particle rate through the straws has been the object of many studies over the past years in the TRT collaboration [1]. In particular, the efficiency as a function of the rate has been studied using test-beam data for many years. In this note, it will be established, that the efficiency can be adequately measured with the system-test set-up using electronically generated pulses. This note has been also motivated by recent measurements in Israel using a high rate \({}^{60}\)Co source which resulted in a significantly lower efficiency at high rates than the test-beam data, as shown in fig. 1. Both these measurements use the same front-end electronics, but differ however in the shape of both the signal and the background1. Footnote 1: Signals are the events for which the efficiency is measured, the background comprises different types of events at various rates.

* In Israel, the signal was an internally generated test-pulse with a fixed amplitude, arriving at a known fixed time. The background rate was generated by photons from a \({}^{60}\)Co source, which has an unknown, rate-dependent energy spectrum.
* At the test-beam, the background was generated using a \({}^{55}\)Fe source. The X-rays impinge on a matrix of straws, which have a reduced gain (about half the nominal gain) in order to emulate a background from minimum ionising particles (MIPs). The signal was generated by particles passing through the straw matrix, and the position of the particles was calculated accurately using data from three planes of Si-strip detectors.

In order to bridge the gap between these different operating conditions, data were acquired (where needed) analysed and compared using the following three front-end board configurations:

1. Setup: front-end boards in system-test laboratory. Signal: internally generated test-pulse. Background: electronically generated random pulses.
2. Setup: straw matrix in test beam. Signal: internally generated test-pulse. Background: \({}^{55}\)Fe source with reduced gain.
3. Setup: straw matrix in test beam. Signal: particle crossing through straw (test-beam data from 2002). Background: \({}^{55}\)Fe source with reduced gain.

The electronically generated background allows an accurate and independent setting of the pulse amplitude, width and of the rate.

In the following, the data acquisition and analysis are discussed with the goal of establishing the validity and limitations of each measurement. This then allows a comparison of the results.

## 2 Experimental setups

### The front-end electronics

Here only a very brief description of the main features of the front-end read-out will be given. Details on the electronics and the straw detector can be found in [3] and [4].

The interaction position in the straw is given by the drift time of the charge that generates the signal. The electronics measures this time in 3.125 ns time bins and for each event 24 of these bins (75 ns) are read out. Each bin contains a binary value indicating if a signal occurred at that time or not. A signal will typically occupy several time bins depending on its amplitude and length. Of interest for this note are

Figure 1: Results from the efficiency measurements using test-beam data and data from a high rate \({}^{60}\)Co source [2]. The differences are significant and have motivated the more detailed study, reported in this note.

mainly the leading-edge (0 to 1 transition) and the time-over-threshold (number of consecutive bins occupied) of an event.

### Setup for electronically generated background

For these measurements, a single end-cap flex-board (12 DTMROC99 and 24 ASDBLR99 chips) was used which was read out by a mini-ROD. Raw data was written to file and all the analysis was performed off line.

In order to compare these measurements accurately to those with the \({}^{55}\)Fe source, it is necessary to have randomly occurring pulses, i.e. with a Poisson distribution. This is achieved by using a powered ASDBLR chip and using the noise to give random events at the output. The rate is controlled by the threshold and was varied between several hundred kHz and up to around 24 MHz. A C.A.E.N Preset Counter Timer was used to measure the average rate and was set to an integration time of 1 s. Accordingly the error on the rate measurement is between 0.3 % and 0.02 % for the lowest and highest rate, respectively. A current-sensitive injector was used to give a Xe-like pulse shape for fast input signals (rise times faster than about 2 ns). However, the output signal could be tuned using the rise time and duration of the input pulse to give various amplitudes and time-over-thresholds in the sensing ASDBLR channel. This is useful since the injector simulates a background of MIPs. An image of some input pulses (PHILIPS PM 5786B) and of the corresponding output signals from the injector are shown in fig. 2. The injector piles up pulses which occur close to each other and thereby simulates reasonably well the straw signal.

The minimum time between two pulses is limited by the dead-time of the electronics. This can be measured by averaging over a large sample (several thousand) triggers on the oscilloscope. After the pulse on which the oscilloscope triggered, the output should be ideally flat if there were no dead-time. However this is not the case as is shown in fig. 3. The positive hump just after the signal that gave the trigger shows the dead-time which is around 25 ns. This will affect the measurements particularly at higher rates. The flat average outside the dead-time is proof of the randomness of the pulses. The time distribution before the trigger pulse is additionally influenced by the trigger timing and is not of interest here.

The dead-time of the system can be taken into account by calculating the probability of receiving more than one pulse within the dead-time, using Poisson statistics. The assumption is then that any pulse occurring within the dead-time would not be detected, thus giving a conservative estimate. An example of the efficiency of detecting a pulse as a function of the background rate is shown in fig. 4. At 24 MHz counting rate, the conservative correction lowers the efficiency by 12 %. If not explicitly stated otherwise, all the efficiency curves shown in this note include the subtraction of the dead-time.

### Setup for \({}^{55}\)Fe background

The analysis in this note includes general test-beam data from the run in 2002 and data taken at the test-beam using the standard test-beam setup for the high-rate studies [1]. These high-rate data were taken at nominal gas gain (\(2.5\cdot 10^{4}\)) and with the new baseline gas mixture of 70 % Xe, 27 % CO\({}_{2}\) and 3 % O\({}_{2}\).

An \({}^{55}\)Fe source (\(K_{\alpha}=5.9\) keV, \(K_{\beta}=6.5\) keV) is placed above a matrix of serially connected straws, thus providing a maximum counting rate above 20 MHz. Various absorbers can be used to reduce the rate.

Figure 2: Image showing the randomly occurring input pulses (bottom) and the injector output signal (top).

The gain on the matrix was set to about 0.5 of the nominal value, therefore giving signals equivalent to about 2.9 keV. The straw receiving the beam has a separate high-voltage line and is serially linked to the matrix.

For all measurements discussed here, the gain on the matrix and therefore the shape of the background pulses was not varied. The use of an \({}^{55}\)Fe source naturally gives a random (Poison) background.

## 3 Measurements

**Definition of efficiency:** The efficiency is defined as the number of leading edges seen within a certain time period divided by the total number of events, triggered during that period.

Figure 3: Oscilloscope image of the randomly occurring pulses (top) and the average over several thousand (bottom). The dead-time gives the positive hump just after the signal that gave the trigger.

### Measurements using the electronically generated background

#### 3.1.1 Experimental procedure

Two pulses are used for the measurements. First, an internally set test-pulse which occurs at a fixed time within the 75 ns readout time and secondly an external test-pulse injected via the injector. The latter is triggered with the random (Poisson) generator with tunable frequency and is used to simulate the background. The two pulses are independent in all respects (timing and shape). The internal test-pulse is used as the event of interest of which the leading edge is required. It is a Xe-like pulse, of which amplitude and width cannot be set independently, and therefore the pulse height, which is set in DAC counts, fully defines this pulse.

The efficiency depends on several parameters, some of which are:

* Time-over-threshold and amplitude of the background pulse.
* Width of the window in which a leading edge is accepted.
* Arrival time of the test-pulse. This is the case because the test-pulse line leads to a clock pick-up on the front-end boards (version of 99).
* Pulse height of the test-pulse (event of interest).

Figure 4: Efficiency as a function of the background rate, calculated directly from the data (excluding the dead-time) and after subtracting the probability of having more than one pulse occurring within the dead-time.

Since it is not feasible to map systematically this four-dimensional parameter space, some linear projections are measured instead to show the influence of each parameter.

In the following, most values are given in DAC counts since this is the value either set or measured. The conversion to eV requires a calibration which is not accurate. However the approximate values of the test-pulse amplitudes and of the threshold settings in eV are:

Threshold set to 60 DAC counts \(\approx\) 200 eV.

test-pulse set to 10 DAC counts \(\approx\) 640 eV.

test-pulse set to 15 DAC counts \(\approx\) 1000 eV.

The background pulses will be referred to by their width (time-over-threshold) and amplitude. Two amplitudes will be distinguished, 2.8 keV and 3.9 keV. These are measured from threshold scans which give the amplitude in DAC units and are converted to keV using the calibration. The uncertainties on the values given in eV are estimated to be around 10-20 %.

#### Efficiency vs. time-over-threshold

For a given injected signal, the distribution of the time-over-threshold for different rates is shown in the sequence of plots in fig. 5. The \(y\)-axes show the numbers of events for 5000 triggers. At zero rate only the noise is seen, at low rate the distribution of the background pulse width is close to its "natural" variation. With increasing rate lower and higher pulse widths are observed which are due to loss of width from the undershoot and pile-up, respectively.

The maximum possible measurable pulse width is 22 time bins since a leading and trailing edge are required in order to avoid counting events which are partly outside the time frame of 24 bins (75 ns). Since the probability of observing a pulse of a certain width depends on its width, the extracted values are weighted accordingly (a 22-bin wide pulse is 22 times less likely to be observed than a pulse of 1 bin since it must start in the first possible bin, whereas the latter can arrive in any of the 22 centre bins).

The peak at around 16 bins is due to pile-up. Since the pulser has a dead-time the second pulse occurs close to the trailing edge of the first one and therefore no events with intermediate widths are observed.

Five different background pulse shapes are considered. The distributions of the time-over-threshold for a high-rate (approximately 20 MHz) are shown in fig. 6. The distributions with low time-over-thresholds show the dead-time of the random generator. For the five different background pulse shapes, the efficiencies for observing the leading edge Figure 5: Dependence of the time-over-threshold on the rate of the background pulses. The noise is seen as small pulse widths with an average of 3 time bins (e.g. top left corner) at very low rates.

of the test-pulse are plotted as a function of the mean background rate in fig. 7.

The data plotted in fig. 7 show a consistently lower efficiency for larger background pulses (larger in either amplitude or width), which is a priori what may be expected. Any subsequent comparison with laboratory data will use one of the efficiency curve given in fig. 7. Details on the loss of events due to pile-up or the undershoot are discussed in section 3.1.5.

#### Efficiency vs. time window for leading edge

For the calculation of the efficiency, a time window is set: if the leading edge is not observed within this window, the test-pulse is defined as lost. The occupancy of leading edges for different background rates is shown in fig. 8 for one of the background pulses (8-bin width and 2.8 keV amplitude). With no background (zero rate), the leading edges of the test-pulses are all contained within three time bins (top left plot in fig. 8). At higher rates, the time spread of the test-pulse increases (due to the bouncing baseline and finite rise time). An accurate value for this time spread is however difficult to extract since the background is not flat. Figure 9 shows the leading-edge occupancies for a background rate of around 20 MHz and for the five different background pulses. The leading-edge occupancies do not show a strong depen

dence on the type of background pulse.

The efficiencies were calculated for a one, three and five-bin wide time-window and are shown in fig. 10 for one of the background pulses (8-bin width and 2.8 keV amplitude). There is a strong dependence of the efficiency on the width of the time window for accepting the leading-edge of the test-pulse. The choice of the width of the time window is a compromise between the efficiency for detecting the actual particle of interest and the probability of picking up a background hit.

In figs. 8 and 9, the background with increasing rate is not flat. The drop around bin 12 is dominated by the width of the test-pulse. These bits are always set if a test-pulse is seen and therefore a leading-edge is a lot less likely in this region. The background outside the region where the test-pulse occurs is not flat. This is due to clock injection on the test-pulse line which is equivalent to a shift in threshold. The distribution of leading-edges with no test-pulse is shown in fig. 11 and clearly shows the modulation due to the clock. This very undesirable effect is being corrected and the test-pulse and board layout have been modified to minimise the clock pick-up (see results in fig. 18).

#### Efficiency vs. arrival time of test-pulse

For a given background frequency (11.4 MHz), the efficiency was measured as a function of the test-pulse delay (arrival time of test-pulse), and the results are plotted in fig. 12 for one of the background pulses (8-bin width and 3.9 keV amplitude). The stability of the background frequency was around 0.3 % (11.37 to 11.40 MHz) and does not affect the results significantly. The test-pulse delay is nominally in units of ns, however this delay is set internally in the DTMROC chip and the absolute scale is not known a priori. The exact scaling factor can be obtained from fig. 12 since the clock period is known (25 ns). Figure 12 shows that the efficiency varies between 61 % and 70 % as a function of the delay because of the clock pickup. For the nominal delay of 20 ns used for all measurements described in this report, the efficiency is about 66 %.

#### Causes for losses of leading-edges

A true leading-edge can be lost because a background pulse occurred shortly before. Secondly, if the test-pulse arrives on the undershoot of a background pulse, it may be lost due to the effective shift in threshold, even if the discriminator output has gone below threshold.

For the analysis a test-pulse is defined as lost due to the undershoot if all bits in the time window are zero. Loss due to pile-up is defined as observing no leading-edge within the time window and not (logicalFigure 9: Occupancy of leading-edges for different background pulses and a background rate of around 20 MHz.

"and not") having all bits zero. Adding these two losses to the efficiency always yields 100 %.

The loss due to the undershoot will depend on the magnitude and width of the undershoot, which are themselves determined by the amplitude and duration of the background pulses. The widths and amplitudes of the five background pulses used in the measurements (see fig. 6) are:

* width: 6 bins, amplitude: \(58.1\pm 0.1\) DAC (high threshold).
* width: 8 bins, amplitude: \(57.9\pm 0.1\) DAC (high threshold).
* width: 8 bins, amplitude: \(81.3\pm 0.1\) DAC (high threshold).
* width: 12 bins, amplitude: \(88.8\pm 0.7\) DAC (high threshold).
* width: 18 bins, amplitude: \(85.4\pm 0.1\) DAC (high threshold).

The loss due to the undershoot as a function of the background rate is plotted for the five pulses in fig. 13. The loss consistently increases with rate and with increasing pulse width and amplitude, reflecting the increase in the undershoot.

The loss due to pile-up is dominant and shown in fig. 14: these losses are also correlated with increasing pulse width and amplitude.

The loss due to the undershoot is due to an effective threshold shift and should therefore decrease for larger test-pulses. The following three figures, 15, 16 and 17, show the efficiency, the loss due to the

understood and the loss due to pile-up for two different test-pulse amplitudes.

The increase in efficiency, seen in fig. 15, for the higher test-pulse amplitude is entirely due to the reduced loss to the undershoot, as shown in fig. 16. The background pulse is the same in both cases and this leads to the same losses due to pile-up, as expected and shown in fig. 17.

### Measurements using the \({}^{55}\)Fe source background

All the measurements described below used the 2001-version of the front-end electronics.

#### Experimental procedure

The \({}^{55}\)Fe background was used for two different efficiency measurements: the first one uses a test-pulse as event of interest (the same as in the previous section) and the second one uses the test-beam tracks (250 GeV pion). The analysis of the test-pulse efficiency is identical to the one described for the electronically generated background.

The efficiency for MIPs requires however a somewhat different analysis. In contrast to the test-pulse, the position (in space and therefore in time) of a MIP signal is not known. Three Si-strip detector planes

are used to accurately predict the position of the particle track within the straw. This then allows to apply a window for the leading-edge, in the same way as for the test-pulse analysis.

The following points are discussed below

* Rate measurement.
* Leading-edge occupancies.
* Time-over-threshold of the \({}^{55}\)Fe background.
* Efficiency for different time-windows in which a leading-edge is accepted.

Since a variation of the background pulses is not considered here, the efficiencies are purely a function of the background rate (apart from the dependence on the width of the window for accepting a leading-edge).

#### Measurement of the rate

1 The rate of events in the straw is measured directly from the data. The background rate itself can be directly measured by requiring that the track passes outside the straw (this is known from the Si-detector data). Since the \({}^{55}\)Fe source is very well approximated by a Poisson distribution, the probability \(p\) of zero events occurring in the straw is

Figure 17: Loss of efficiency due to pile-up as a function of the mean background rate for two different test-pulse amplitudes.

\(p(0)=e^{-\lambda}\), where \(\lambda\) is the mean number of X-rays absorbed in the straw. This is easily calculated from the data:

\[p(0)=e^{-\lambda}=\frac{number\ of\ empty\ events\ (all\ bins\ =\ zero)}{number\ of\ events\ with\ zero\ in\ the\ first\ bin} \tag{1}\]

where \(\lambda\) is the mean number of events in 23 time bins or 72 ns. The normalisation to the number of events which have a zero in the first bin is necessary, because the time-over-threshold would otherwise allow previous events to set bits in the time window of interest (23 time bins), which would falsely increase the measured rate. The influence of the time-over-threshold is therefore limited to reducing the statistics of a given measurement. Examples of measured rates at different thresholds are given in table 1.

The noise rate increases strongly at lower thresholds and has been subtracted from the measured rates, i.e. the rates given for different thresholds in table 1 are expected to be the same. The maximum deviation from the mean value (19.57 MHz) is 1.2 sigma, for the 300 eV threshold.

#### Leading-edge occupancies

As mentioned in section 3.1.4, the clock pick-up is expected to be reduced on this version of the front-end boards. The leading-edge occupancies for different rates of the \({}^{55}\)Fe background are shown in fig. 18. These plots are to be compared with those in fig. 11, clearly the clock pick-up has been vastly improved.

#### Time-over-threshold of the \({}^{55}\)Fe background

The background pulses of all measurements using the \({}^{55}\)Fe source are the same, since the gain on the matrix was not changed. The time-over-threshold was measured in the same way as described in section 3.1.2 and is plotted for different rates in fig. 19. The threshold for these data was approximately 250 eV. The natural spread of the width of the \({}^{55}\)Fe background is larger than for the electronically generated background (see fig. 5), mainly due to variations in the straw response. With increasing rate, the width increases due to pile-up. The mean

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c c c c|} \hline Threshold [eV] & 200 & 250 & 300 & 400 \\ \hline Rate [MHz] & 19.02\(\pm\) 0.47 & 19.92\(\pm\) 0.44 & 20.09\(\pm\) 0.43 & 19.23\(\pm\) 0.40 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Measured background rates for a fixed \({}^{55}\)Fe configuration and for different threshold.

time-over-threshold is about 11 bins and, with an equivalent energy of 2.9 keV, the most closely matching electronic background would therefore be a mix of two settings: the pulse 8-bin wide and 2.8 keV in amplitude and the pulse 12-bin wide and 3.9 keV in amplitude (see fig. 6).

#### Efficiency vs. time-window for the leading-edge

The results of this section are to be compared to those of section 3.1.3. The equivalent plot to fig. 10 is shown in fig. 20 for the \({}^{55}\)Fe background and a test-pulse signal, i.e. the efficiency is plotted for different widths of the window accepting the leading-edge. As before, a window of three time bins is used as the nominal window.

The results of a similar analysis of the MIP data are shown in fig. 21. Clearly the efficiency for observing an expected signal in a straw shows a different behaviour than the test-pulse efficiency. Most notably, the efficiency at zero rate does not approach unity. This is due to the intrinsically larger spread of the arrival time of the signal. A plot of the differences of the expected arrival time (from Si data)

Figure 18: Leading-edge occupancies for different background rates. The clock pick-up has been virtually eliminated.

and the measured leading-edge position measured by the TRT read out is shown in fig. 22. A Gaussian fit to these residuals yields a sigma of around one time bin, which corresponds to about 130 \(\mu\)m. If no background were present, a three-bin wide window should include 86 % of all events, the measured value is 82 % (three bin window at zero rate in fig. 21) which is lower because of the non-Gaussian tails observed in fig. 22. Around 95 % of the width is due to the signal generation in the straw (only about 5 % comes from the resolution of the Si detectors and the time resolution of the electronics). The observed width is strongly dominated by the drift time accuracy of the straw.

## 4 Results

Four efficiency measurements are to be discussed and potential differences understood. These are:

### Electronic vs. \({}^{55}\)Fe background

The electronically generated background can be directly related to the \({}^{55}\)Fe background, by comparing the test-pulse efficiencies. As mentioned in section 3.2.4, the \({}^{55}\)Fe pulses have a time-over-threshold and amplitude, which are somewhere between two measurements with the electronically generated background (8 bins wide, 2.8 keV in amplitude and 12 bins wide, 3.9 keV in amplitude). These three efficiency curves are plotted in fig. 23. The slope of these curves is not the same within 10 % or so: part of this difference may be due to the differences between the electronic and \({}^{55}\)Fe backgrounds, another part is probably due to systematics on the estimated electronic background rate. At higher rates the MIP efficiency is increased due to background signalswhich are falsely observed as signal events. This is the case because about 20 % of the MIP signals are not seen within the time window (see fig. 21). This allows a random background pulse occurring in the time window to be seen as a signal event. In the case of a test-pulse signal this is not the case since the leading-edge of the test-pulse always occurs within the time window. Due to the good agreement at rates below 15 MHz it is considered justified to conclude, that using the electronically generated background allows to measure the test-pulse efficiency in a representative and adequate way. In summary, the electronically generated background is good to about 10 %.

### Test-pulse vs. MIP signal

The data used for this comparison were all taken using the \({}^{55}\)Fe background. The efficiency curves for both the test-pulse and MIP signal are shown in fig. 24. These two curves clearly differ significantly, mainly for the reasons explained in section 3.2.5.

To conclude on the comparison of the test-pulse and MIP efficiencies, it may be said that the difference in efficiencies at lower rate is explained from the fact the the natural fluctuation of the leading-edge position is larger for the MIP signal which results in higher losses due to the acceptance window. Although the efficiencies at higher rates are not significantly different the trend suggests that the MIP signal has a somewhat higher efficiency than expected from the electronic

background measurement at background rates above about 15 MHz.

### 4.3 Electronic and \({}^{55}\)Fe vs. \({}^{60}\)Co background

From section 4.1 it is assumed justified to use the electronically generated background as a representation of true events in the straw.

The available data for the \({}^{60}\)Co background are the efficiency as a function of the background rate only. The time-over-threshold of this background as given in [2] is not comparable with the definition used in the note. The approach is therefore to establish the equivalent background pulses by comparing the efficiencies with the electronically generated background.

The relevant efficiencies are the \({}^{60}\)Co data, the most closely matching data using the electronically generated background and as a reference the efficiency with the \({}^{55}\)Fe background. These efficiency curves are shown in fig. 25.

The two efficiency curves using sources to generate the background rate, are clearly not compatible. The \({}^{60}\)Co data of [2] correspond in average to signals of higher amplitudes for the background pulses and this is to some extent seen by the comparisons in fig. 25. This is conclusive since the energy loss of the \({}^{60}\)Co photons is dominated by pair production and Compton effect, giving X-rays and electrons with energies of tens and hundreds of keV.

The conditions using the \({}^{60}\)Co background are therefore not very similar to the generally expected MIP background at the LHC and the

Figure 24: test-pulse and MIP efficiencies as a function of the mean \({}^{55}\)Fe background rate.

observed lower efficiencies in the \({}^{60}\)Co measurements need therefore not be a concern.

## 5 Conclusions

The signal efficiency as a function of the background rate has been evaluated using various background pulses and signals from MIPs and the internal test-pulse. For the test-pulse signal and the electronically generated background the efficiencies were evaluated for different background pulse shapes and the losses due to pile-up and the undershoot showed a very consistent behaviour. Overall the results of these investigations showed what may a priori be expected, i.e. losses consistently increase with larger background pulses.

The comparison of the efficiency curves for different background pulses showed the following:

* The method of using an electronically generated background is an adequate representation of the \({}^{55}\)Fe background.
* The efficiencies measured for MIPs and test-pulses differ significantly, which is explained by the larger time spread of the MIP signal.

Figure 25: Efficiency data for the \({}^{60}\)Co background with the two most similar efficiencies from the electronically generated background. The efficiency for the \({}^{55}\)Fe source is also plotted and is clearly far higher than for the \({}^{60}\)Co background.

* The \({}^{60}\)Co source gives a much harder background spectrum and consequently is not adequately representing the expected MIP dominated background at the LHC and therefore the lower efficiencies observed in [2] need not be a concern.
