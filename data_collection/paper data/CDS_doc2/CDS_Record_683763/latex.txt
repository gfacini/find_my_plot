###### Abstract

The knowledge of the transport and amplification parameters (drift velocity, first Townsend and attachment coefficients) of the gas mixtures used for avalanche operated Resistive Plate Counters gives the possibility of better understanding the underlying physical processes of these detectors and of developing Montecarlo simulations of their behaviour. We present here a measurement of the drift velocity \(v_{d}\) and of the amplification coefficient \(\eta\) in \(C_{2}H_{2}F_{4}\)-Isobutane mixtures. The ionization in the gas, contained in a 6\(\times\)22 cm\({}^{2}\), 2 mm gap RPC, is obtained by means of a pulsed \(N_{2}\) laser, via double photon ionization. Results are presented for \(v_{d}\) and \(\eta\) as a function of the applied electric field.

Introduction

Because of their excellent time resolution and good rate capability, when used in avalanche mode, Resistive Plate Counters (RPC) [1] have been chosen as muon trigger detectors in ATLAS [2] and CMS [3]. Even though the RPC are simple devices from the point of view of the field configuration, a full simulation of the signal development is still at a very early stage [4]. Important ingredients for a complete understanding of their behaviour are the numerical values of physical parameters like the electron drift velocity \(v_{d}\), the first Townsend coefficient \(\alpha\) and the attachment coefficient \(\beta\) in the operating gas mixture as a function of the applied electric field.

In this note we present the measurements of the "effective" amplification coefficient \(\eta=\alpha-\beta\) and of the drift velocity in two \(C_{2}H_{2}F_{4}\)-Isobutane gas mixtures: \(97\%-3\%\) and \(90\%-10\%\) by using a nitrogen laser to ionize the gas in a well localized point within the RPC gap.

## 2 Experimental Setup

A schematic view of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. The RPC is a 2 mm gap, 22\(\times\)6 cm\({}^{2}\) large, linseed oiled detector, equipped with a single copper strip 3 cm wide and 22 cm long. Given the reduced size of the detector, no spacers are used to maintain the gap between the two bakelite planes. Two holes, 2 mm diameter, in the frame, located in the center of the longer edge, allow for the passage of the laser beam, which is kept accurately parallel to the bakelite plates.

The RPC is placed inside a plexiglas box (40\(\times\)15\(\times\)15 cm\({}^{3}\) size), to ensure the proper gas thightness. The gas mixture flows directly into the RPC through its gas inlet and fills the entire volume of the plexiglas box. Quartz windows are provided for the entrance of the UV light in correspondence of the holes in the RPC frame. The whole box is shielded with aluminum as a Faraday cage.

The gas mixture is set by means of mass flowmeters and monitored by a flow controller. The gas is continuously circulated through the box volume at a rate of 20 sccm (corresponding to about 4 volume changes per day). The accuracy on the gas composition is estimated to be 0.1%. The absolute and relative internal gas pressures are monitored with an accuracy of 0.1 Torr, while the gas temperature is measured within 0.1 \({}^{0}\)C.

High voltage is supplied by a CAEN SY127 system. The applied voltages for both the investigated mixtures range from 8.6 to 9.4 kV with an accuracy and a reproducibility of better than 0.4% of the set value. This is taken into account in the evaluation of the errors on the measured gas properties.

A system of three stepping motors, equipped with electronic motion controllers, allows for micrometric displacements of the box (containing the RPC) and of the laser beam. The RPC can, thus, be moved along the laser beam and in a direction transverse to it (respectively x and y axes in Fig. 1) with an accuracy in both directions of 3 \(\mu\)m. The laser beam can be translated along the z axis by means of a periscope. A converging lens, 10 cm focal length, is mounted solid to the periscope. The focused laser beam can also be moved with an accuracy of 3 \(\mu\)m.

The alignment of the system is performed by means of a He-Neon laser, mirrors and calibrated pinholes. Two of these pinholes are positioned on the gas box just upstream and downstream of the quartz windows. The parallelism of the RPC plates with respect to the laser beam has been accurately established.

Ionization is induced in the gas gap by means of a \(N_{2}\) laser operating at a main wavelength \(\lambda=337\ nm\), corresponding to a photon energy of about 3.68 eV. The laser has a 300 ps pulse duration, 40 \(\mu\)J pulse energy, 3 mrad\(\times\)2 mrad beam divergence and operates at a maximum repetition rate of 20 Hz. A set of optical absorbers is located upstream of the periscope to reduce the beam intensity down to a "single electron" ionization regime. The beam waist at the focus of the converging lens, has been measured to be about 15 \(\mu\)m, and the ionization region is even smaller (about 7 \(\mu\)m), since the ionization probability depends quadratically on the intensity. A fraction of the laser beam is reflected from a quartz beam splitter upstream of the periscope and directed towards a fast phototube, to be used as the start for the drift time measurement.

The RPC signal is fed to two Phillips 6955 voltage amplifiers in chain. The readout strip in the RPC is not terminated on the end opposite to the amplifier.

The data acquisition is performed by a digital scope with 2 Gsa/s sampling rate and 500 MHz bandwidth, set to provide time measurements with the best achievable resolution on "single shot " signals (0.5 ns).

Both the photomultiplier and the RPC signals are readout and digitized via a GPIB interface on a Macintosh 7100/66, equipped with LabView 3.2 analysis software. The start time from the photomultiplier is taken at a fixed threshold. The stop time from the RPC is taken at its voltage peak. The time difference between the two signals and the RPC peak voltage are then recorded and stored for the offline analysis.

## 3 Measurements

At the laser focus, the UV light produces electron clusters essentially by ionizing impurities loosely bound in the gas, via double-photon absorption processes. These electrons, drifting and multiplying through the uniform field region, produce the signal by capacitive induction on the strip.

The beam intensity is attenuated by means of optical absorbers in order to reduce as much as possible both the transverse and longitudinal dimension of the ionization region, thus ensuring a "single electron" regime with a final ionization rate of about one signal every tenlaser pulses.

Measurements were taken in the region from 8.6 to 9.4 kV. This corresponds to the region of interest for RPC operating at LHC experiments (e.g., the knee of the efficiency plateaux for RPC prototypes tested on beam and filled with the investigated gas mixtures, ranged between 8.7 and 9.0 kV). In this region, the RPC is working in avalanche mode for most part of the voltage range and, when the streamers signals start to compete with the avalanche, only the proportional signal is recorded and analized. Fig. 2 shows the \(\Delta t\) distributions obtained at: 9.2 kV and 1.4 mm from the anode, 9.0 kV and 1.0 mm and 8.6 kV and 0.8 mm for the 97%-3% gas mixture. It is worth noticing that the time distributions are almost perfectly gaussian, with no relevant tails. The time resolution is mainly due to the electron diffusion. Other contributions come from the time resolution of the scope, the laser pulse duration, phototube resolution and electronics.

For each location of the laser spot inside the gap, the average arrival time of the signal on the strip, relative to that of the nearest location to the strip \(\Delta t_{i}\), is plotted versus the difference of the respective location distances, \(\Delta t_{i}\). The drift velocity \(v_{d}\), for any given value of the drift field, is obtained as the slope of the linear fit to that plot. A set of 5 different location was used in these measurements, ranging from a distance of 0.8 mm to

Fig. 7 shows the behaviour of the "effective" amplification coefficient \(\eta\) versus the inverse of the reduced field. The fit in figure is performed with the empirical formula by Korff [5]

\[\frac{\eta}{p}=Ae^{(-\frac{p_{R}}{E})}\,. \tag{1}\]

where we have used \(\eta\) instead of the first Townsend coefficient to take into account the electron attachment which is not negligible for these gas mixtures characterized by large electron affinity. The resulting value for constants A and B are listed in figure for both mixtures. The data seem to be consistent with this simple parametrization, even at these high fields. They are also consistent with the Raether condition \(\eta d<20\), where \(d\) is the gap size.

## 5 Conclusions

A conceptually simple setup has been described, capable of investigating and measuring the transport parameters of any RPC gas mixture and of furnishing experimental inputs for the development and the understanding of the basic mechanism of these detectors [4]. Drift velocity and "effective" amplification have thus been measured in the two tetrafluoroethane based gas mixtures extensively used in RPC beam tests by ATLAS and CMS, respectively, over a high voltage range for a fully efficient operation of RPC in avalanche mode.
