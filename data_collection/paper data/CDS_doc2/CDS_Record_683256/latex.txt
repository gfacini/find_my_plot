###### Abstract

Preliminary results for a hadron calorimeter to be used in the ATLAS experiment at LHC are presented. The calorimeter is made of iron and scintillator tiles read by wavelength shifter fibers. The tiles are oriented in a longitudinal configuration. i.e., almost parallel to the incoming particles. This geometry allows good hermiticity and an easy construction. Three modules have been tested with electrons, pions and muons at the CERN SPS. Calibration, monitoring and radiation hardness of this detector have been studied.

## 1 Introduction

To study the physics accessible at LHC. the calorimetry system of the ATLAS detector needs to have the following properties [1]:

- good electromagnetic (\(em\)) calorimetry for identification and measurement of photons and electrons in the energy range from 7-10 GeV up to a few TeV;

- hermetic jet and missing transverse energy measurement:- ability to operate and trigger at luminosities in excess of \(10^{34}\)\(cm^{-2}\)\(s^{-1}\);

- ability to tolerate the radiation level accumulated during at least 10 years of operation.

The _em_ calorimeter will be a lead/liquid argon (Pb/LAr) with an accordion structure for the lead plates, complemented with a preshower [3]. The energy resolution of this calorimeter in the range 10-300 GeV is \(\sigma/E=9.8\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 0.2\%\oplus 0.29/E\)[2]. An iron/scintillating tiles hadron calorimeter was chosen for the central region of the ATLAS detector [3] (Fig. 1). It consists of a 5.9 m long barrel part and two 2.7 m long 'extended' barrel parts, each part subdivided into 64 sectors, which correspond to an azimuthal granularity of \(\Delta\phi\simeq\)0.1.

The principle of this novel technique is a traditional iron/scintillator sandwich calorimeter, in which the tiles are placed inside the iron absorber structure in R-\(\phi\) planes (Fig. 2), instead of the usual \(\phi\)-Z orientation [4, 5]. WaveLengthShifter (WLS) fibers coupled to the two radial edges of the tiles can thus be kept straight in the radial direction. Outside the absorber structure they are grouped according to the wanted segmentation of the calorimeter and coupled to photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). This configuration allows for good hermeticity, easy mounting and low cost.

Close to zero rapidities the tile structure is about parallel to the primary particles. Most of them will have interacted already in the _em_ calorimeter (about 2 interaction lengths in depth). To prevent high energy particles from travelling over long distances

Figure 1: _Conceptual layout of the ATLAS calorimeter_

in the scintillator, the individual tiles are kept short and are staggered with respect to each other (Fig. 3).

## 2 Prototype

For the prototype [6], the iron structure was made by piling 5 mm thick and 1.8 m long laser cut iron sheets, alternately with smaller 4 mm thick and 10 cm long iron spacers, thus allowing to insert the 3 mm thick tiles. The effective period is 18 mm due to the staggered positioning of the tiles, and the iron to scintillator ratio is 4.67 to 1 in volume.

The scintillator tiles (PSM-115) were made by injection molding technology at Protvino IHEP, Russia, with granulated polystyrene base doped with 1.5% PTP and 0.03% POPOP. They were wrapped with a white paper acting as a diffusor. At both ends of each tile, 1 mm diameter WLS fibers were inserted in U-shaped grooves (Figs. 2 and 3) and were covered with aluminized mylar reflector. Bicron BCF91A fiber aluminized at the end opposite to the PMTs were used. Fibers were then grouped and connected to XP2012 \(5/4\)" PMTs via light mixers. The whole structure was compressed by rods traversing the absorber stack and the tiles along the full length of the sector. Some of the rods are hollow for insertion of a cesium source to be used for calibration purposes.

The prototype is composed of 3 modules, each module covering 0.1 in \(\phi\) and 1 m along \(z\). The total thickness is 9 \(\lambda_{int}\) (1.8 m) with a \(+\)-fold segmentation in depth and 5 along \(z\). The prototype was exposed to electrons. pions and muons in the H2 test beam at the SPS.

Calibration and monitoring

The monitoring of the response of the light detectors has been achieved using a laser device injecting light to all phototubes via clear fibers. The stability of the laser response has been ensured using photodiodes. This device allows to monitor the gain and the linearity of the light detectors, and a precision of 1 % was achieved.

The cell to cell intercalibration has been handled using a \({}^{137}\)Cs source (5 mCi) embedded in a wire which is moved inside the rods along \(z\), thus allowing to probe each individual tile by measuring the DC-current (Fig. 4). Thanks to the well adapted geometry of our calorimeter and the optimum range (\(\sim\)2 cm) of the \(\gamma\)'s produced by the \({}^{137}\)Cs, this method is a very powerful tool for controlling the quality of the detector during its construction.

The reproducibility of the \({}^{137}\)Cs calibration method has been measured to be 1 %. Before putting the prototype in the beam, this method was used to perform an initial adjustement of the cell to cell response. The precision of the calibration with respect to particles response was investigated during the test beam. The correlation between \({}^{137}\)Cs and particle response has a spread (\(\sigma\)) of 4%, which indicates that the \({}^{137}\)Cs intercalibration error is \(\leq\)4%. This error is expected to further improve.

## 4 Preliminary test beam results

### Muons

The response to 225 GeV muons for various incident angles is shown in Fig. 5. The slight angular dependence is mostly geometrical. The peak signal is around 16.6 pC,

Figure 4: _Measurement with the source along \(z\)_

corresponding to 2.6 GeV. At LHC nominal luminosity the noise due to pile-up in a \(\Delta\eta\,\times\,\Delta\phi\,=0.1\,\times\,0.1\) cell is \(\sim\)0.4 GeV. This value leads to a signal/background ratio of 6.5 which is comfortable.

### Pions

A scan along 60 cm in the \(z\) direction was performed using 80 GeV pions. The uniformity of the response is 0.85 % in r.m.s (Fig. 6).

The energy resolution has been studied for various incident angles, for energies ranging between 20 and 300 GeV. The result is well described by (Fig. 7) : \(\sigma/E\,=\,47\%/\sqrt{E}+2.3\%\). This very promising result was obtained without using any weighting technique and without the electromagnetic calorimeter in front.

The \(e/\pi\) response has been measured to be 1.2 at 20 GeV.

### Light yield

In the electron energy resolution, the statistical fluctuations coming from the number of photoelectrons produced contributes to the \(1/\sqrt{E}\) term, to be added in quadrature to the sampling fluctuations contribution.

The light yield has been measured as 20 photoelectrons per GeV, using the neutral density filter technique [7]. This value will be increased using the new double cladding fibers Y11(200)M from Kuraray. These fibers were tested in the beam and produce a light yield \(\sim\)1.6 times higher than the fibers we used in the prototype.

## 5 Radiation hardness

### Dose levels expected in the barrel hadron calorimeter in ATLAS and associated light loss

The expected annual peak dose in the ATLAS iron/plastic scintillator barrel hadron calorimeter coming from charged particles and neutron fluxes (\(E_{n}<100KeV\)) is 36 Gy/year at \(\eta\)=1.5, considering a 5 cm polyethylene moderator in front of the Pb/LAr _em_ calorimeter [8, 9]. This dose was obtained simulating a general ATLAS detector where the calorimeters were mean media of Pb/LAr (em) and Fe/LAr (hadronic) [1, 10]. Because we have an iron/plastic scintillator calorimeter the dose induced by neutrons and charged particles in the plastic scintillator is higher and was corrected for. The expected dose profiles along the depth after 10 years working at a luminosity of \(1.6\times 10^{34}\)_cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)_ (\(10^{6}\)\(pb^{-1}\)) are shown in Fig. 8. for \(\eta\)=0 and \(\eta\)=1.5.

The SDC experimental radiation damage results [11] were used to evaluate the light reduction as a function of the dose, since this is the configuration closest to the TILECAL calorimeter. The light yield (ratio after/before irradiation) as a function of the dose at the maximum of the shower induced by 2.5 GeV electrons in a SDC module is shown in Fig. 9, for 3 different modules.

Several tile/WLS fiber assemblies in the TILECAL configuration were also irradiated in a \({}^{60}\)Co \(\gamma\)-source and the preliminary results are very encouraging. PSM-115 tiles of 200x100x3 \(mm^{3}\) and 350x100x3 \(mm^{3}\) were irradiated almost uniformly with a dose of 2.75 KGy, and the last meter of 1.5 m long fibers was irradiated with a dose of 2.2 KGy. The dose in the first 0.5 m is almost negligible. This dose profile overestimates the expected dose in the calorimeter which decreases logarithmicaly as a function of the fiber depth. The dose rate was 16 Gy/hour. The fibers used in this test were BCF91A and Y11(200)M.

The light output of each tile/fiber assembly was measured before and after irradi

Figure 6: _80 GeV pion X scan_ Figure 7: _Pion energy resolution_ation with a \({}^{90}\)Sr source along the tile. Two fibers of the same type were used in the measurements. The light output of 2 tile/fiber assembly types (PSM-115/BCF91A and PSM-115/Y11(200)M) is shown in Fig. 10a) and 10b) respectively. The light reduction after irradiation is more or less the same, i.e, 14% for the assembly with BCF91A and 11% for the assembly with Y11(200)M.

The \(\triangle\) and \(\oplus\) points in Fig. 9 for a dose of 2.75 KGy (\(\sim\)100 years working at LHC) correspond to the two TILECAL configuration tile/fiber assemblies, and are in good agreement with the SDC results. The light reduction of an irradiated tile measured with non-irradiated BCF91A fibers is \(\sim\)3.5%. showing that the light reduction in the fibers is the major contribution to the light loss of the tile/fiber assemblies.

Using the parametrized curve of the results shown in Fig. 9 we estimated the expected light yield on the hadron calorimeter for \(\eta\)=0 and \(\eta\)=1.5 for an integrated luminosity of 10\({}^{6}\)\(pb^{-1}\). Before recalibrating longitudinally each of the 4 cells the light reduction in the first tile (the worst case) is 6.2% for \(\eta\)=1.5 and 4.8% for \(\eta\)=0. After recalibration these values change to 1.8% and 1.1% respectively.

Effect of radiation damage on the performance of the TILECAL hadron calorimeter in the barrel region

To evaluate the effect of the radiation damage on the performance of the calorimeter, jets of 300 GeV were generated using GEANT and FLUKA in the ATLAS configuration (accordion Pb/LAr _em_ and TILECAL hadron calorimeter). The light reduction for each tile was evaluated for an integrated luminosity of 10\({}^{6}\)\(pb^{-1}\) for \(\eta\)=0 and \(\eta\)=1.5. In the LAr _em_ calorimeter no degradation due to radiation was considered.

Conclusions

A fully containing TILECAL calorimeter prototype has been tested. The achieved accuracy was 1% for the laser monitoring system of the readout and \(\leq\)4% for the Cs intercalibrating tool. Preliminary results of the tests with muons and pions indicate that the prototype achieves ATLAS specifications in terms of energy resolution and signal/background ratio. The light yield obtained can be increased by a factor \(\sim\)2 with optimization of components such as fibers, tiles and PMTs.

Relatively to radiation damage, the calorimeter will survive 10 years running at LHC using tiles and fibers commercially available now. The degradation in the energy resolution is negligible.
