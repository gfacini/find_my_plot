**1. Introduction**

The aim of this note is to discuss the concept and construction of the shielding of the ATLAS forward region [1]. The composition and organization of the shielding result from the goal it has to achieve, namely the shielding against neutrons and photons copiously produced in the high rate proton-proton collisions at large impact parameter and subsequent hadron interactions in the surrounding material. High-energy particles from the interaction point begin to cascade when entering material. If the material is thick, the cascade development will continue until most of the charged particles have been absorbed. For such a purpose, this material has to be as dense as possible. The remnants are mostly neutrons and associated gamma. While electromagnetic cascade are rapidly absorbed, neutrons will travel long distance losing their energy gradually. Nuclear capture of thermal neutrons frequently results into production of gamma. Gamma also result from excited-state decay of spallation products and from fast neutron interactions with atomic nuclei. Most of them, neutrons and gamma, should be confined in the shielding volume. The ATLAS forward region has to be surrounded by a structure made of neutron and gamma absorbing materials selected and combined towards optimal moderation of unconfined fast neutrons and reduction of gamma radiation produced by neutrons during the slowing down process in the shielding materials themselves.

We have proposed and tested recently [2] the idea of a segmented outer shielding against neutron and gamma: iron, borated polyethylene (BPE), iron, optionally lithium doped polyethylene (LiPE), without any lead used for gamma shielding.
