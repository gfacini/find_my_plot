Monte Carlo Generators for the Production of a \(W\) or \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) Boson in Association with Jets at ATLAS in Run 2

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

This note documents the Monte Carlo generators used by the ATLAS collaboration at the start of Run 2 for processes where a \(W\) or \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson is produced in association with jets. The available event generators are briefly described and comparisons are made with ATLAS measurements of \(W\) or \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) +jets performed with Run 1 data, collected at the centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The model predictions are then compared at the Run 2 centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. A comparison is also made with an early Run 2 ATLAS \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) +jets data measurement. Investigations into tuning the parameters of the models and evaluating systematic uncertainties on the Monte Carlo predictions are also presented.

This revised version includes updated predictions for MG5_aMC+Py8 FxFx at 7 TeV, and some minor text corrections.

## 1 Introduction

The production of jets in association with a \(W\) or \(Z/\gamma^{*}\)1 boson is a plentiful signal at the LHC. Measurements of \(V\)+jets (\(V\)=\(W\) or \(Z\)) allow the study of QCD in complex high multiplicity final states, and constitute an excellent testing ground for the latest predictions which reach next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy. The leptonic (electron or muon channel) decay modes of the \(W\) or \(Z\) boson in particular provide a clear experimental signature by which to identify such events.

Footnote 1: The letter \(Z\) will be used as shorthand for \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) for the rest of this note.

\(V\)+jets processes also form the background to a large number of other measurements and searches for new phenomena. In these analyses, it is desirable to have an accurate model of the data, which is typically more precise than the formal accuracy of the calculations. A common feature of Monte Carlo (MC) programs used to generate \(V\)+jets processes is the combination of tree-level multileg matrix elements with increasing final-state multiplicity that are merged with parton showers to yield a fully inclusive sample with no double counting. Recent developments have included the incorporation of matrix element calculations at NLO accuracy. The production of high statistics, reliable \(V\)+jets MC samples is key to much of the physics programme in Run 2, and while a number of generators are available this document reviews the status of the primary samples produced by ATLAS.

The LHC Run 2 data taking period started in 2015 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, yielding an integrated luminosity around 15% of that accumulated in Run 1. Although the \(W\) and \(Z\) cross sections increase by a factor of around 1.8, the 2015 data sample has fewer events due to the lower integrated luminosity. Run 2 will continue in 2016, where the integrated data luminosity is expected to be much larger than 2015. The present analyses on 2015 data are using MC samples produced in the initial ATLAS Run 2 MC production campaign. A second round of analyses will be performed on the 2016 data allowing the testing of updated versions of the MC generators that are going to be implemented in the upcoming ATLAS MC production campaign during 2016.

In this note a comparison of the MC models used by ATLAS in Run 2 analyses is made with ATLAS \(V\)+jets measurements performed at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The same models are then used to generate events at the current Run 2 centre-of-mass energy 13 TeV to investigate further the differences between the predictions. The predictions are also compared to early Run 2 2015 ATLAS \(Z\)+jets measurements. The aims of this study are twofold. First, the majority of physics analyses need a default sample that provides an accurate description of the data, without taking into account the theoretical uncertainties on that sample. This is not necessarily a "fair" comparison, as different predictions can be associated with significantly different uncertainties which may cover any discrepancies with data, but the results in Sections 4 to 7 are assessed with that criteria in mind. Second, the results in Section 8 assess the uncertainties on one of the predictions.

Throughout this note we use the standard ATLAS definitions of coordinates, a right-handed system with the \(z\)-direction defined by the beam direction, and \(x\) pointing towards the centre of the LHC ring. The polar angle \(\theta\) is defined relative to the \(z\) axis, and pseudo-rapidity \(\eta=-ln(tan(\theta/2))\), with the transverse direction corresponding to \(\theta=\pi/2\), \(\eta=0\). Transverse momentum, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), is defined as the component of momentum in the transverse direction. The polar angle, \(\phi\), is defined in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. Angular separation is defined by \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}}\). Rapidity is defined by \(y=0.5\times(E+p_{z})/(E-p_{z})\), where \(E\) is the total energy, and \(p_{z}\) the component of the momentum in the \(z\) direction.

## 2 Event generators

Details of the event generators appearing in this note are given below. This includes MC programs that are currently used in early Run 2 analyses of ATLAS 2015 data, or to be used in the production campaign for the analysis of the 2016 data. Other generators such as Alpgen[1] and Powheg MiNLO[2] are under consideration but not shown here. Further studies of inclusive \(W\) and \(Z\) predictions from Powheg[3, 4, 5], have been carried out elsewhere [6].

### Sherpa 2.1

ATLAS Sherpa 2.1 samples are produced using the multileg MC generator Sherpa v2.1.1[7]. This version of Sherpa allows the generation of matrix elements up to NLO accuracy, which is done for \(V\) + 0, 1 and 2 jet processes. The 3 and 4 jet multiplicities are generated at leading-order (LO), and higher multiplicities via the Sherpa model of the parton shower [8]. The LO and NLO matrix elements are generated using the Comix [9] and OpenLoops [8] matrix element generators, and the merging with the parton shower is done using the ME+PS@NLO prescription [10]. The CKKW-L matching and merging procedure [11] is applied to avoid double counting and the merging scale is set to 20 GeV. The NLO CT10 PDF set with \(\alpha_{s}=0.118\) is used, and the Sherpa model of parton shower and underlying event are interfaced. Renormalisation and factorisation scales are set to the Sherpa default, which involves a shower-based clustering of the multi-parton configurations to define the core process and scale. Sherpa produces a full 5-flavour scheme 2 prediction, with massless \(b\)- and \(c\)-quarks in the matrix elements and massive quarks in the parton shower. The Sherpa MC generator includes a model of multiple parton interactions (MPI). Heavy flavour quarks can be produced directly in the hard scattering process of underlying events. At the 7 TeV centre-of-mass energy, only a small test sample of Sherpa 2.1 is available. Larger, fully simulated, samples of events using this version of Sherpa are available for the analysis of the ATLAS 2015 data. These samples are generated in intervals of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the vector boson ([0,70], [70-140], [140-280], [280-500], [500-700], [700-1000], [1000-2000], [2000-E\({}_{\mathrm{CMS}}\)] GeV), and split into the heavy flavour components \(b\)-, \(c\)-, and \(l\)-jets by use of a heavy hadron event filter, to have increased statistics for events at high transverse momentum or containing heavy flavour.

Footnote 2: In the 5-flavour scheme all partons, including the \(c\)- and \(b\)-quarks are treated as massless in the hard scattering and can be produced directly from the proton PDF. The c and b quarks are put on shell in the final state.

### Sherpa 2.2

Sherpa v2.2.0[7] is a general MC event generator which is doing both the matrix-element generation and the parton showering with the ME+PS@NLO prescription [10]. \(V\) + 0, 1 and 2 jets processes are generated at NLO while \(V\) + 3 and 4 jets are generated at leading-order (LO). All the additional jets are produced by the parton shower. An improved CKKW-L matching and merging procedure [11] is applied in order to avoid double counting events, and the same scheme as v2.1 is used to define the scales. As with Sherpa 2.1, version v2.2.0 uses the 5-flavour scheme with massless \(b\)- and \(c\)-quarks in the matrix elements and massive quarks in the parton shower. The PDF set used for Sherpa v2.2.0 is NNPDF 3.0 NNLO with \(\alpha_{s}=0.118\)[12]. A refined tuning with respect to Sherpa 2.1 was undertaken to help improve the description of LHC data. It is intended to use this version of Sherpa to generate ATLAS Sherpa 2.2 samples to be used for the analysis of the 2016 data.

### MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 CKKW-L

ATLAS MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [13] (hereafter referred to as MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L) samples are produced using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO 5 v2.2.2 interfaced to Pythia v8.186 [14] for the modelling of the parton shower and underlying event. The CKKW-L matching and merging procedure is applied, with a merging scale of 30 GeV. The renormalisation and factorisation scales are set to the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO default values, based on a clustering of the event. LO matrix elements for 0-4 jets are included, with all additional jets produced by the parton shower. The NNPDF v2.3 LO PDF set [12] is used, with \(\alpha_{s}=0.13\). The A14 tune [15] of Pythia 8 is used. MadGraph5_aMC@NLO performs a 5-flavour calculation with massless \(b\)- and \(c\)-quarks in the matrix element, and massive quarks in the Pythia 8 shower. Fully simulated samples using this setup, referred to as "MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L A", are available to be used in the analysis of ATLAS 2015 data.

Further tuning of the MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L parameters and using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.2.3 and Pythia v8.210 [16] was carried out to produce new samples (referred to in this note as "MG5aMC+Py8 CKKW-L B"), which are a possible basis for fully simulated event samples in 2016. This tuning includes switching to a NLO PDF (NNPDF 3.0 NLO [12]) with \(\alpha_{s}=0.118\), and updating the matching/merging parameters to allow more of the phase space to be covered by the matrix element part of the calculation (d-parameter \(0.4\to 0.2\), \(\Delta R(lepton,jet)\)\(0.4\to 0\)). Finally, an alternative choice for the calculation of the scale in unordered emissions in Pythia 8 was used (_unorderedAScalePrescrip_\(1\to 0\)) was found to reduce the rate of high energy jet production. The qualitative improvements in the description of the data are discussed in section 4.

### MadGraph5_aMC@NLO with FxFx Merging

Samples have also been generated using the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO program to generate \(V\) + 0, 1 and 2 jets to NLO accuracy. The different jet multiplicities are merged using the FxFx prescription [17] implemented in the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO program (version 2.3.2 is used here and is subsequently referred to as "MG5_aMC+Py8 FxFx"). Samples are generated using the NNPDF v2.3 NLO PDF set with \(\alpha_{s}=0.119\), and the merging scale is set to 25 GeV. The events are generated in a 5-flavour scheme and the showering and subsequent hadronisation is preformed using Pythia 8.210 with the A14 tune, using the NNPDF 2.3 LO PDF set with \(\alpha_{s}=0.13\). It is worth noting that similar comparisons using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO have also been carried out in Ref. [18].

### Cross Sections

Table 1 lists the cross sections for each of the generators, and the NNLO references [6, 19] obtained using FEWZ [20] and the MSTW2008NNLO PDF set [21]. All generators are normalised to the NNLO inclusive \(Z\) or \(W\) cross sections and the required k-factor, obtained from the ratio of the NNLO and generator predictions, is given. In the case of the \(Z\) predictions, the NNLO cross section was derived in the dilepton mass range \(66<M_{ll}<116\) GeV, which is different from the range \(M_{ll}>40\) GeV used in the event generators. The \(f\)-factor is the ratio of these two ranges, calculated for each generator, and is used to allow a comparison to the NNLO cross section.

In figures where no data is present, the bottom panel shows the ratio to Sherpa 2.1, with the yellow band representing the statistical uncertainty on this Sherpa sample.

## 4 MC and data \(Z\)+jets results at 7 TeV

In this section the ATLAS 7 TeV \(Z\) inclusive data from [19] and [23], the \(Z\)+jets data [24] and the \(Z\)+\(b\)-jets data [25] are compared with the predictions of the MC generators. In the Figures the data are compared with the MC generators used for 2015 ATLAS data analyses (Sherpa 2.1 and MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L A), and also with MCs which ATLAS is intending to use for the analysis of the 2016 dataset, namely Sherpa 2.2, an improved tune using MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L B and MG5_aMC+Py8 FxFx.

Figure 1 shows a comparison of the inclusive \(Z\) rapidity and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). For the case of \(Z\) rapidity, comparison of the MC programs being used for ATLAS 2015 data analysis shows that Sherpa 2.1 gives a much better description of the data than MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L A. This is driven by the use of a LO PDF in MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L A versus a NLO PDF in Sherpa 2.1, and motivates the switch to a NLO PDF (NNPDF 3.0 NNLO [12]) for the updated MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L B samples. Using a NLO PDF in MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L B leads to a clear improvement in the description of the \(Z\) rapidity distribution in the data. The other MCs considered for the 2016 data analyses, Sherpa 2.2 and MG5_aMC+Py8 FxFx, provide a reasonable description of the rapidity. For the inclusive \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) then MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L B again provides a better description than MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L A. For the NLO MCs Sherpa 2.1 and Sherpa 2.2 and MG5_aMC+Py8 FxFx all give reasonable descriptions of the data.

Figure 2(a) shows the exclusive jet multiplicity in the 7 TeV \(Z\)+jets analysis, where it can be seen that all predictions agree with the data within uncertainties across all multiplicities. The \(H_{T}\) distribution, where \(H_{T}\) is the summed scalar \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the leptons, jets and missing transverse energy, shown in Figure 2(b) shows good agreement, though with different trends in each generator. For example, the MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L A predicts larger \(H_{T}\) than Sherpa 2.2 across most of the phase space. The leading and second jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and rapidity, shown in Figure 3, show some issues in Sherpa 2.1, with an excess of events at high jet rapidity. A slope relative to data for jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) below 100 GeV is also observed, which and further cross checks found this to be unrelated to the issue at high jet rapidity. These features are both improved by the new tune used in Sherpa 2.2. The MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L A predictions in jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) have a tendency to be harder than the data. Investigations with MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L identified sensitivity to the choice of scale for the unordered shower emissions in certain topologies. The tuning of this scale parameter in MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L B leads to an improved description of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) data. The MG5_aMC+Py8 FxFx MC gives a reasonable description of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and rapidities of the jets.

Angular correlations between the two leading jets, and the invariant mass of this two-jet system in \(Z\) events are shown in Figure 4. The small mismodelling in \(\Delta\phi\) by Sherpa 2.1 is improved in Sherpa 2.2.

## 5 MC and data \(W\)+jets results at 7 TeV

In this section the ATLAS 7 TeV \(W\)+jets analysis of the \(\mathrm{k}_{t}\) splitting scale [27] and the \(W\)+jets cross section measurement [28] are compared with the predictions of the MC generators. In Figures 6-9 the data are compared with the MC generators used for 2015 ATLAS data analyses (Sherpa 2.1 and MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L A), and also with MCs which ATLAS is intending to use for the analysis of the 2016 Run 2 dataset, namely Sherpa 2.2, an improved tune using MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L B and MG5_aMC+Py8 FxFx.

Figure 6 shows the \(\mathrm{k}_{t}\) scale of successive clusterings in \(W\)+jets events, where it can be seen that the two MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L predictions are very similar and generally provide the best description. The Sherpa 2.2 MC while not giving a perfect description provides a large improvement over Sherpa 2.1. Figure 7 shows the inclusive jet multiplicity in the 7 TeV \(W\)+jets analysis, where it can be seen that all predictions agree with the data within uncertainties. The \(H_{T}\) distribution in \(W\)+jets events is shown in Figure 7 and all the predictions show generally good agreement, with similar differences in the predictions as were observed in the \(Z\)+jets \(H_{T}\) distribution.

The leading, second and third jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and rapidity distributions are shown in Figure 8. For the leading jet, unlike the \(Z\) analysis, Sherpa 2.1 and Sherpa 2.2 provide a slightly better description of the data, than the MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L predictions. The same high rapidity excess seen in the \(Z\) case is again visible in Sherpa 2.1 and improves substantially in Sherpa 2.2. The MG5_aMC+Py8 FxFx, as in the case of the \(Z\) data, provides a good description of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and rapidity of the jets.

Correlations between jets, shown in Figure 9, reveals some interesting behaviour. While Sherpa has a clear excess at high \(\Delta y\), MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L tends to be at the upper edge of the data uncertainties and MG5_aMC+Py8 FxFx describes the data well, though the sample is statistically limited at very high \(\Delta y\). These tendencies are correlated with similar trends in \(\Delta R\) and the dijet mass. The description of \(\Delta\phi\) and \(\Delta y\) improve when going from Sherpa 2.1 to Sherpa 2.2.

## 7 MC \(W\)+jets results at 13 TeV

In this section comparison is made with the predictions of the MC generators using the same Rivet routines used in the 7 TeV comparison above, but increasing the centre-of-mass energy to 13 TeV. Predictions exist for the two MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L tunes and for Sherpa 2.1.

Figure 16 shows the \(\mathrm{k}_{t}\) scale of successive clusterings in \(W\)+jets events, where the same trends seen at 7 TeV are visible. Figure 17(a) shows the inclusive jet multiplicity, where the two MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L tunes give similar predictions and agree with Sherpa 2.1 to within 10%. In the \(H_{T}\) distribution, shown in Figure 12(b), significant differences are observed. The leading, second and third jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and rapidity distributions, shown in Figure 13, clear differences between the predictions are visible, with the two MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L MCs predicting a generally harder \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution, and MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L B is slightly softer than MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L A. The expected excess of events at high rapidity in Sherpa 2.1 is still visible.

Correlations between jets, shown in Figure 19, again show some clear differences between predictions. In general, as was the case with \(Z\)+jets, the differences at 7 TeV are amplified when going to 13 TeV.

## 8 Systematic variations

The uncertainties on the predictions of the MC generators for \(V\)+jets processes is an important area of study because they can affect significantly both the normalisation and shape of the predictions. The implementation of physics models in MC event generators represents an approximation to a particular order in QCD and the uncertainty is usually estimated by varying the parameters of the calculation, such as the factorisation scale \(\mu_{F}\) and the renomalisation scale \(\mu_{R}\). The uncertainty evaluated in this manner is usually reduced in magnitude when a higher order calculation is performed.

In this section the uncertainties on the ME+PS@NLO model in Sherpa are evaluated. In section 8.1 details are given on the samples used in ATLAS to estimate modelling uncertainties on the Sherpa 2.1 MC samples used presently in the 2015 ATLAS data analyses at 13 TeV. In preparation for the 2016 MC production campaign the modelling uncertainties on the Sherpa 2.2 MC program are studied in section 8.2. The systematic variations for Sherpa 2.2 are made at 7 TeV so that comparisons with data can be made. Work is ongoing to record the systematic uncertainties as weights in the generated event files to make analysis easier for ATLAS physicists. Similar samples and recording of systematic uncertainties in the event header are being undertaken using MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L.

### Sherpa 2.1 Systematic Uncertainties

From the nominal Sherpa 2.1 configuration four parameters are varied to investigate uncertainties from the modelling of the \(V\)+jets process:

* Matrix element matching (CKKW): varies the scale taken for the calculation for the overlap between jets from the ME and the Parton Shower (PS). The default setting is 20 GeV and it is varied down to 15 GeV and up to 30 GeV.
* Renormalisation scale (Renorm): varies the scale for the running strong coupling constant for the underlying hard process. The renormalisation scale is varied up and down by a factor of 2.
* Factorisation scale (Fac): varies the scale used for the parton density functions (PDFs). The factorisation scale is varied up and down by a factor of 2.
* Resummation scale (QSF): varies the scale used for the resummation of soft gluon emission. The resummation scale is varied up and down by a factor of 2.

Truth-level samples with these variations have been produced by ATLAS as part of the 2015 MC production campaign. The following studies consider the variations for the \(Z\to\nu\nu\) channel, though similar behaviour is expected for \(Z\to ll\) and \(W\to l\nu\) samples. For each of the four variations two samples are produced: down variations (referred to as CKKW15, Renorm025, Fac025, QSF025 respectively) and the up variations (referred to as CKKW30, Renorm4, Fac4, QSF4 respectively).

Figures 20(a), 20(b) and 21, show kinematic distributions at truth-level of the systematic variations (down variations - solid line, up variations - dashed line) for the \(Z\to\nu\nu\) samples. For this study, jets are reconstructed using the anti-k\({}_{t}\) algorithm with a distance parameter of 0.4, and are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.8\). No requirements are placed on the neutrinos. The most significant variation is found to be associated to the change in renormalisation scale.

### Sherpa 2.2 Systematic Uncertainties

This section presents results on systematic uncertainties using the Sherpa 2.2 generator. The study is performed at 7 to allow comparison with ATLAS data. The systematic uncertainties for Sherpa 2.2 are expected to be broadly similar to Sherpa 2.1 and these studies represent a validation of the new version in preparation for the upcoming 2016 MC production campaign.

Both \(Z\)+jets and \(W\)+jets samples with variations of the factorisation, renormalisation and merging scales were produced at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. Note that the variation of the factorisation and renormalisation scales was made by a factor \(\sqrt{2}\) and \(1/\sqrt{2}\) which is smaller than the usual variations made, for example, in section 8.1. The CKKW merging scale was varied from its nominal value of 20 GeV down to 10 GeV and upwards to 20 GeV and 30 GeV.

The effect of varying the factorisation scale factor from \(1/\sqrt{2}\) to \(\sqrt{2}\) is shown for the \(Z(W)\) jet multiplicity and \(H_{T}\) distributions in figure 22(24). A significant variation at low jet multiplicity and low \(H_{T}\) is observed for both \(Z\) and \(W\). This was found to be due to a bug in Sherpa 2.2 related to the NLO counter-terms for the scale factor variation. A fix will be introduced in the new release of Sherpa 2.2 to be used for the 2016 MC production campaign.

For the variation of the renormalisation scale factor from \(1/\sqrt{2}\) to \(\sqrt{2}\) only a vary small effect is observed on the predictions and the distributions are not shown here. The Sherpa 2.1 study of \(Z\to\nu\nu\) found significant effects from varying the renormalisation scale, so this requires further investigation. The effect of the variation of the merging scale down to 10 GeV and up to 30 and 40 GeV is shown for the \(Z(W)\) jet multiplicity and \(H_{T}\) distributions in figure 23(25). Figure 25(a) for \(W\)+jets and Figure 23(a) for \(Z\)+jets show that the merging scale has a large effect at large jet multiplicity and that increasing the merging scale could improve the agreement between the MC samples and data. Samples with a merging scale \(\geq 30\) GeV give MC predictions within the data uncertainty. However, Figure 25(b) for \(W\)+jets and Figure 23(b) for \(Z\)+jets show that merging scale of 10 GeV leads to a large data-prediction discrepancy in the distributions. The Sherpa authors are currently investigating this effect.

## 9 Conclusion

For the LHC Run 2, ATLAS aims to use more than one nominal set-up for V+jets processes, given the relevance of these processes across the physics programme. Two multi-leg generators for V+jets have been so far studied in detail and presented in this note: Sherpa, which merges NLO 0,1,2-jet matrix

elements and LO 3,4,5-jet matrix elements, and MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKW-L, which merges 0-4-jet LO matrix elements. Further samples produced with MG5_aMC+Py8 FxFx are under development, which merge 0-2 jets NLO matrix elements.

Comparisons to existing data at 7 and 13 TeV reveal some differences between predictions, but overall a reasonable description of the data by all generators considered. At 13 TeV, further generator comparisons show that some differences between predictions observed at 7 TeV are enhanced, and tuning to the 13 TeV data may be necessary. Preliminary studies on the systematic variations of the main setting parameters such as renormalisation, factorisation and merging scales with the Sherpa generator are also reported, highlighting some topics for future study.
