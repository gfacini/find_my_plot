This note presents the performance of the ATLAS barrel presampler, as obtained from full simulation and reconstruction of single particle events in the whole electromagnetic calorimetry system. An estimation of the electronic and pile-up noises have been performed and the impact of the upstream material on the presampler response has been studied.

Introduction

The presampler acts as a thin (11 mm) active layer of liquid argon, which provides a first sampling of the showers in front of the accordion electromagnetic calorimeter [1]. In the transverse plane, it has a polygonal shape formed by 32 identical azimuthal sectors per half-barrel, each sector spanning 0.2 in \(\phi\) and 1.52 in \(\eta\). The two barrel halves are identical. The sectors are mounted on rails which are fixed on the barrel internal rings. Figure 1 shows a barrel module of the EM calorimeter with two presampler sectors suspended at the front.

The granularity of the presampler corresponds to one electromagnetic calorimeter cell in the \(\eta\) direction (\(\Delta\eta=0.025\)) and four in the \(\phi\) direction (\(\Delta\phi=0.1\)).

The external envelope of a presampler sector is a 0.4 mm thin glass-epoxy shell which houses eight modules of unequal length secured together by 3 m long FR4 bars : its impact on the energy measurement remains very small (for more details see [2]). Each module covers a constant region of \(0.2\times 0.2\) in the \((\eta;\phi)\) plane, except for the modules located at the edge of the EM barrel for which the \(\eta\) coverage is reduced to 0.12. The total number of channels needed to read out this device is 7808 (122 per sector).

More details on the modules geometry, the electrode characteristics, the production of the modules and the sectors, the support structure and the cabling can be found in [3].

The electronic noise in the presampler

In the presampler and the electromagnetic calorimeter, the \(\Ot\) preamplifiers are the main source of electronic noise. It is frequently expressed as an equivalent noise current (ENI), which is the initial current of a triangular pulse at the input whose maximal voltage amplitude at the output is equal to the rms of the noise [4] :

\[\mathrm{ENI}^{2}=\frac{\mathrm{A}}{t_{p}^{5}}+\frac{\mathrm{B}}{t_{p}^{3}}+ \frac{\mathrm{C}}{t_{p}} \tag{1}\]

Here, \(t_{p}\) is the 5-100% peaking time while A, B and C depend on the detector capacitance \(C_{d}\). Their values have been measured for \(C_{d}=150\) pF and \(C_{d}=390\) pF (see Table 1). For the other values of \(C_{d}\), the parameters A, B and C have been interpolated from these two measurements.

Another way of computing the electronic noise is to use the equivalent noise energy (ENE), which is expressed in MeV. It is related to ENI through a conversion factor \(k\) given by :

\[k=\frac{e}{W\times t_{d}}=16.1\ \mathrm{nA/MeV} \tag{2}\]

where \(t_{d}\) and \(W\) are respectively the drift time (420 ns) and the mean energy required to produce an ion-electron pair (23.6 eV).

For the eight presampler modules, the values of \(C_{d}\), \(t_{p}\), ENI and ENE are listed in Table 2 (for these calculations, a shaping time \(\tau\) of 15 ns has been used).

## 3 The pile-up noise in the presampler

For the systems using bipolar shapers, the rms of the pile-up noise can be separated into one physics dependent term and one hardware dependent term [6] :

\[\sigma_{pile-up}^{2}=\sigma_{E}^{2}\times\frac{I_{pile-up}}{T_{c}} \tag{3}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(C_{d}\) & A & B & C \\ \hline
150 pF & - & \(0.5\times 10^{8}\) & \(6\times 10^{4}\) \\
390 pF & \(0.06\times 10^{12}\) & \(2\times 10^{8}\) & \(7\times 10^{4}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Module & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\ \hline \hline \(C_{d}\) (pF) & 160 & 169 & 189 & 210 & 223 & 263 & 341 & 384 \\ \hline \(t_{p}\) (ns) & 31.7 & 32.1 & 32.8 & 33.6 & 34.0 & 35.3 & 37.6 & 38.7 \\ \hline ENI (nA) & 61.3 & 62.0 & 63.7 & 65.3 & 66.2 & 69.0 & 73.9 & 76.3 \\ \hline ENE (MeV) & 3.80 & 3.84 & 3.95 & 4.05 & 4.10 & 4.27 & 4.58 & 4.73 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The physics dependent term \(\sigma_{E}\) is the pile-up noise density. It corresponds to the variance of the energy deposited by minimum bias events per bunch crossing in a given cluster (further refered to as \(E_{pile-up}\)). In the following, let \(g(t)\) be the normalized signal waveform at the output of the bipolar shapers with a triangular signal at the input of the detector (see Figure 2). If \(N_{samp}\) and \(N_{k}\) are respectively the number of time samples for which \(g(t)\neq 0\) and the number of minimum bias events in one bunch crossing (which is chosen according to a Poisson distribution with a mean of 23 at high luminosity), then \(E_{pile-up}\) is given by :

\[E_{pile-up}=\sum_{k=1}^{N_{samp}}g(t_{k})\cdot\sum_{j=1}^{N_{k}}E_{j} \tag{4}\]

For what concerns the hardware dependent term \(\frac{I_{pile-up}}{T_{c}}\), it is given by :

\[\frac{I_{pile-up}}{T_{c}}=\frac{1}{T_{c}}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}g^{2}(t)dt= \sum_{k=1}^{N_{samp}}g^{2}(t_{k}) \tag{5}\]

Figure 3 displays the energy spectrum for the minimum bias events in one presampler cell at \(\eta=1.1\). One can notice that the value of \(E_{pile-up}\) at the top of the peak is slightly negative : this is due to the fact that the number of time samples for which \(g(t)\leq 0\) is greater than the number of time samples for which \(g(t)\geq 0\). One can also notice that the energy distribution is not symmetric and that there are more events on the positive side than on the negative side : this is due to the fact that \(|g(t)|\) is several times larger for the positive time samples than for the negative ones. Combining these two effects, one gets a mean value of zero, as expected.

Figure 2: Normalized amplitude of the signal at the output of the shapers for a module of type 5 of the presampler and for a shaping time of 15 ns.

Figure 3 also displays \(\sigma_{pile-up}\) for various positions in \(\eta\) and various cluster sizes in the presampler (only 98% of the minimum bias events have been used for this calculation, in order to avoid some bias in the calculation of the rms due to the events situated in the tails). One can notice that \(\sigma_{pile-up}\) increases with \(\eta\), for two main reasons :

* \(E_{pile-up}\) mainly depends on the width of the active layer where the minimum bias events deposit some energy : it is thus roughly proportional to \(ch\eta\).
* \(I_{pile-up}\) increases with \(\eta\).

If there was no correlation between the energies which are deposited in the presampler cells, then one would expect \(\sigma_{pile-up}\) to be proportional to \(\sqrt{N}\), where \(N\) is the number of cells in the cluster. On the contrary, with maximal correlations, one would except \(\sigma_{pile-up}\) to be proportional to \(N\). Here, the dependence of the pile-up noise on the cluster size is of the following form :

\[\sigma_{pile-up}\propto(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi)^{c}\mbox{ with }c\simeq 0.6-0.7 \tag{6}\]

Consequently, some correlations do exist between the energies which are deposited by pile-up events in the presampler cells inside a cluster. The same effect is observed in the EM calorimeter [7]. According to [8], these local correlations seem to be mainly due to the production of hadronic jets in the minimum bias events.

Optimization of the shaping time in the presampler

Variations in the value of the shaping time \(\tau\) have opposite effects on the electronic noise and the pile-up noise :

* if \(\tau\) increases, so does the peaking time \(t_{p}\) : this involves that the electronic noise is a decreasing function of \(\tau\), as suggested by eq. (1).
* for \(\tau\ll t_{d}\), \(I_{pile-up}\) decreases linearly with \(\tau\) (the slope is 0.12 for all the presampler modules) : the larger the value of the shaping time, the larger the pile-up noise.

As a result, an optimal value can be found for \(\tau\) in order to minimize the total noise (defined as the quadratic sum of the pile-up noise and the electronic noise), as shown in Figure 4 for two \(\eta\) positions in the presampler (only one cell is used here).

The larger \(\eta\), the smaller the optimal value of \(\tau\) : as the pile-up noise increases with \(\eta\) "faster" than the electronic noise, one has to compensate for the difference of behaviour between the two noise contributions by decreasing the integration time of the signal, as it is shown in Table 3.

Up to now, all the calculations have been performed with one cell in the presampler. But, as there is no correlation between the presampler cells for the electronic noise, the optimal value of \(\tau\) decreases when one increases the cluster size. As an example, with \(2\times 2\) cells in the cluster, \(\tau_{optimal}\) is 27 ns (respectively 18 ns) at \(\eta=0.3\) (respectively \(\eta=1.1\)).

Figure 4: Variation of the various noise contributions with \(\tau\), in one presampler cell at \(\eta=0.3\) and \(\eta=1.1\).

In the following, we will use 15 ns for the shaping time [9] which is the optimal value for \(\tau\) in the EM calorimeter, where the detection cells are much more numerous than in the presampler and where much more energy is deposited.

## 5 Computation of the optimal energy weighting and of the optimal cluster size for the presampler

### Calibration of the energy scale for the presampler and the EM calorimeter

Let \(E_{0}\), \(E_{1}\), \(E_{2}\) and \(E_{3}\) be the energies which are deposited in the active parts of the presampler and of the three longitudinal samplings of the calorimeter respectively. Then, the total energy of the incoming particle can be written as :

\[E_{tot}=\alpha\times(\beta E_{0}+\sum_{i=1}^{3}E_{i}) \tag{7}\]

Here, \(\beta\) is the weight which is associated to the presampler energy. In order to optimize it, we proceed as follows. The electronic and pile-up noises are switched off and \(\alpha\) is set to 1. The energy resolution of the whole EM calorimeter is then calculated as a function of \(\beta\) (see the upper plot in Figure 5). The distributions that one obtains are fitted with a parabola, in order to get the value of \(\beta\) that minimizes the energy resolution. The second plot in Figure 5 shows that the optimal value for \(\beta\) is about 3.2 if \(|\eta|<0.8\) and about 3.7 if \(0.8<|\eta|<1.4\).

Once the presampler weight is determined, the overall calibration factor \(\alpha\) can be determined. It is adjusted in order to make the mean value of \(E_{tot}\) equal to the energy of the incoming particle : \(\alpha\) is of the order of 5.5 (respectively 4.6) if \(|\eta|<0.8\) (respectively \(0.8<|\eta|<1.4\)).

One can notice that \(\alpha\beta\) is almost independent on \(\eta\) (it is about 18 all over the pseudo-rapidity range in the barrel). This is due to the fact that the amount of active material crossed by an incoming particle in the presampler varies with \(\eta\) just like the amount of inactive material upstream the presampler.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(|\eta|\) & 0.1 & 0.3 & 0.5 & 0.7 & 0.9 & 1.1 & 1.3 & 1.5 \\ \hline \(\tau_{optimal}\) (in ns) & 29 & 29 & 28 & 28 & 24 & 22 & 19 & 17 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Variation of the optimal value of \(\tau\) with \(\eta\).

### Optimization of the cluster size in the presampler

The energy resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter strongly depends on the number of detection cells used in the longitudinal samplings to reconstruct an incoming electron or photon. The larger the cluster size, the better the electromagnetic shower containment and thus the better the sampling term in the energy resolution. But, on the other hand, the larger the number of cells used, the larger the pile-up and electronic noises. As a result, one has to optimize the size of the cluster as a function of the incoming particle, its energy and \(\eta\). For the three samplings of the calorimeter, see reference [10].

Figure 5: Variation of the EM calorimeter energy resolution with the presampler weight at \(\eta=1.1\) and variation of the optimal presampler weight with \(\eta\).

For what concerns the presampler, the optimal cluster sizes are :

* \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=2\times 1.5\) for electrons or converted photons.
* \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=2\times 1\) for non-converted photons.

When \(\Delta\phi\) is 1.5, one uses \(\Delta\phi=1\) if the shower barycenter is closer to the center of the cell than to its edge, otherwise one uses \(\Delta\phi=2\).

## 6 Impact of the upstream material on the presampler performances

### Impact of the upstream material on the presampler energy response

The energy in the presampler strongly depends on the amount of upstream material and thus on \(\eta\). Electrons and photons which are produced at \(\eta\simeq 0\) cross a small amount of material before entering the presampler. As a result, the number of secondary ionizing particles remains rather small because the electromagnetic shower has not developed significantly. On the contrary, if one looks at incoming particles at the edge of the barrel, the amount of upstream material crossed by electrons and photons is large, so the electromagnetic showers start to develop upstream the presampler. As a result, the number of secondary ionizing particles in the presampler is very large and, thus, the fraction of the energy of the incoming particle which is deposited there becomes significant.

Figure 6: Variation of the EM calorimeter energy resolution with \(\eta\) and with the cluster size in the presampler for electrons and photons having a transverse energy of 20 GeV.

The energy in the presampler also strongly depends on the energy of the incoming particle : the larger it is, the more longitudinally extended the electromagnetic shower and thus the smaller the fraction of its energy deposited in the presampler.

Figure 7 perfectly illustrates these two results : the presampler weighted response increases when \(\eta\) increases and when the energy of the incoming particle decreases.

### Impact of the upstream material on the energy resolution

The upstream material also has a significant impact on the EM calorimeter resolution. To study this, both the electronic noise and the pile-up noise were switched off. Thus, one has :

\[\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{a^{\prime}}{\sqrt{E}} \tag{8}\]

For electrons with a transverse energy of 20 or 50 GeV, Figure 8 shows the influence of \(\eta\) (and thus of the amount of upstream material) on \(a^{\prime}\), in two different situations :

* the presampler is not used and the energy weight of the first sampling is optimized in order to minimize \(a^{\prime}\).
* the presampler is used with its optimal energy weight and the three calorimeter samplings have an energy weight of one.

The impact of the presampler on the energy resolution is clearly visible, especially when the amount of upstream material is significant. For instance, for 20 GeV electrons at \(\eta~{}=~{}0.3\) (respectively \(\eta~{}=~{}1.1\)), the presampler allows a gain of 20% (respectively 40%) on the sampling term.

## 7 Conclusion

This note describes the main performances of the ATLAS barrel presampler. An estimation of the electronic noise and of the pile-up noise was performed and it has been shown that the shaping time chosen for the EM calorimeter is somewhat too fast to minimize the total noise in the presampler. The optimal weights and the optimal cluster sizes have been determined. A study of the variations of the presampler response with \(\eta\) clearly indicates that, as expected, the larger the amount of upstream material, the larger the fraction of the energy of the incoming particle which is deposited in the presampler and the larger the improvement of the EM calorimeter energy resolution thanks to the use of the presampler.
