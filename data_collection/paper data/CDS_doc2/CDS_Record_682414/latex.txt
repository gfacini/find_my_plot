SEARCHING FOR QUARK-LEPTON COMPOSITENESS AT LHC E.C. Katsoufis Physics Department National Technical University Athens, Greece

Abstract

The limits on the quark-lepton compositeness scale are investigated for one nominal year of running at the Large Hadron Collider to be built at CERN. By comparing the e- mass distribution above 1 TeV/c\({}^{2}\) for the Standard Model Drell-Yan process with that expected if quarks and leptons have common constituents and that from the main background at LHC, tt -> W*b W-\(\overline{\mbox{b}}\) -> e*ve-\(\overline{\mbox{b}}\), it is found that we can reach the limits A\(\overline{\mbox{L}}\) > 16 TeV or 26 TeV for an annual luminosity of 10\({}^{4}\)pb\({}^{-1}\) or 10\({}^{5}\)pb\({}^{-1}\) (normal),respectively, at the 5 s.d. level.

1. INTRODUCTION

It is generally believed that the standard model (SM) is rather part of a more complete theory characterized by an energy scale \(\Lambda\). The consequences of the complete theory could be observed at energies well below \(\Lambda\) and be expressed by a residual effective interaction called the contact term. If quarks and leptons are made of more elementary constituents, the preons, then, contact terms could arise from preon interchange during the interaction of a quark with an antiquark producing a lepton-antilepton pair (Fig. 1a) or from the exchange between the preons of the carriers of the underlying metacolor force (Fig.1a,1b). One could then expect deviations in the total or differential cross sections of the SM Drell-Yan process by the inclusion of the contact term (point) interaction described by the interaction of a quark and a lepton current, Fig.2. Quark-lepton contact interactions are expressed by Eichten et al (1) in an effective Lagrangian of the chirally invariant form

\(\begin{array}{l}\mbox{\tt g}^{2}(\Lambda)\\ \mbox{\tt L}\mbox{\tt e}^{\tt q}=\mbox{\tt L}\mbox{\tt E}\mbox{\tt n}\mbox{\tt e}^{\tt q}(\mbox{\tt l}\mbox{\tt l}\mbox{\tt r}^{\tt u}\mbox{\tt l}\mbox{\tt a}\mbox{\tt l}\mbox{\tt r}^{\tt u}\mbox{\tt l}\mbox{\tt a}\mbox{\tt l}\mbox{\tt r}^{\tt u}\mbox{\tt l}\mbox{\tt a}\mbox{\tt l} \mbox{\tt l}\mbox{\tt r}^{\tt u}\mbox{\tt l}\mbox{\tt r}^{\tt u}\mbox{\tt l} \mbox{\tt a}\mbox{\tt l}\mbox{\tt l}\mbox{\tt r}^{\tt u}\mbox{\tt l}\mbox{\tt r }^{\tt u}\mbox{\tt l}\mbox{\tt r}^{\tt u}\mbox{\tt l}\mbox{\tt r}^{\tt u} \mbox{\tt l}\mbox{\tt r}^{\tt u}\mbox{\tt l}\mbox{\tt r}^{\tt u

with n equal for example to mL.

The Aija and Aijaq are bilinear combinations of various known couplings.

Finally the differential cross section for the LHC

process pp-1'- is given by

do

dcoso* u,c,t dcoso* d,s,b x x x2

+ q -> \(\overline{\mathbf{q}}\), 0* -> x-0* (5)

where the Fa/p(x) is the structure function of the

parton q inside the proton carrying an x fraction of the

 latter's momentum.

From (3) and (4), it is clear that we get a

 constructive interference between the SM and contact

interaction terms when n=-1, a value argued by Suzuki (3) to

be theoretically plausible. Thus compositeness could

manifest itself by an excess of opposite-sign dilepton

events over the SM expectations.

It should be noticed that because of flavor

independence, we theoretically expect similar results for.

the dimuon final state.

The present limits on ALL (9) for eeqq (uuqq) from

the various accelerators are shown in Table 1:TABLE 1. Current limits on All\({}^{\ddagger}\) for eeqq (uuqq)

The purpose of this note is to see through a Monte

Carlo approach how compositeness would manifest itself at

LHC energies and set limits on All^, with one nominal year

of LHC running.

2. SIGNAL EXPECTATIONS AT LHC and SAMPLES

a. The analysis given in this note was based on

samples of pp interactions generated with the Monte Carlo

program Pythia 5.6(5) which has incorporated in it the

Born-level matrix element of Eichten et al (1) for

quark-lepton compositeness.

Specifically, samples of 1000 di-electron events were

generated for the SM Drell-Yan process with and without the

compositeness amplitude and using various choices for the

proton structure functions Fa/p(x).

Mainly the Eichten-Hinchliffe-Lane-Quigg (EHLQ) sets wereusedwithQCDA=200 MeV (set 1) or A=290 MeV (set 2), whichworkfine whenhighaccuracyisnotanecessity(6).

b. Backgrounds

The main background to the above opposite dilepton

process at LHC energies comes from the production through

pp -> ttX, tt -> W*bw-b (6)

Here, t -> -Wb 100%, since the present lower mass limit

(Fermilab) exceeds the Wb threshold and W-> e% for 1/9 % of the times. In the on-mass shell process t->Wb, the top quark

first decays weakly and then hadronizes itself.

The cross section for at the LHC CM energy of 15.6

TeV that Pythia finds is about 3000 pb for m=140 GeV and

m=300 GeV (notvers sensitive).

This cross section is much higher than the other

background processes \(\vartheta\)(W*W-)\(\approx\)90 pb, \(\vartheta\)(WZ)\(\sim\)30 pb and \(\vartheta\)(ZZ)\(\sim\)10

pb which could also give rise to opposite lepton pairs.

A sample of 500 t events were generated demanding

m=7>400 GeV/c^2, pr >200 GeV/c and m="e>500 GeV/c^2 (by

modifying the subroutine PYEVNT so that the program

satisfies the last condition in order to reduce generation

time). This sample amounts to across section of 0.089 pb,

comparable to the expected Drell-Yan, for the same interval

of the dilepton mass.

3. FINDING A 5 S.D. EXCESS SIGNAL

The generated SM, SM including compositeness and tt

events samples described in Section 2, were reduced into

ntuple structures, which were further analyzed by PAW (7) at

the CERN IBM or the Silicon Graphics workstation of NTU

Athens.

We have compared the transverse momentum weighted

distribution of the expected events of both electrons for

thetheresamples above and for the integrated luminosity

10\({}^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The harder prspectrum due to the presence of

compositeness is clear for A=14 TeV. A cut of 'ne'<2.5 on

the pseudorapidity of both electrons has been applied, to

account for the lepton acceptance of the ATLAS detector of

up to 2.8. The effect of this cut is shown in Table 3 for

each sample.

Fig.3 shows the expected number of events for the

sample with A=14 TeV as a function of the di-electron

invariant mass and for the same integrated luminosity and

rapidity cut as mentioned. Again, the excess of events due

to compositeness is clear, whereas the tt background is

 diminished. The numbers shown should be multiplied by the

electron (or muon) detection-reconstruction efficiencies

which are expected to be better than 90% for each electron

in ATLAS.

4. CONCLUSIONS

The di-electron mass distributions of generated events have been compared above 1 TeV for the Standard Model alone, SM including compositeness and tt, at the LHC CM energy of 15.6 TeV. Imposing pseudorapidity cuts!n!<2.5 and transverse momentum pr>400 GeV/c on both electrons, and assuming a 90% detection-reconstruction efficiency for each lepton, we find that with the low annual luminosity 10\({}^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), we can set the limit on the quark lepton compositeness scale \(\Lambda\)LL\({}^{-}\)=16 TeV. With the high (normal) annual luminosity of 10\({}^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), we can reach the limit of 26 TeV. Both results are at the 5 s.d.level.
