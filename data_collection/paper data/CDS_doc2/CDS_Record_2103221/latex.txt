**A study of optimal parameter setting for**

**MadGraph5_aMC@NLO + Pythia 8 matched setup**

ATLAS Collaboration

This note presents a study to reach the optimal parameter settings of the Pythia 8 generator's parton shower and multiple parton interaction parameters, termed a tune, for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO + Pythia 8 matched setup. The study is based on published distributions from ATLAS Run 1 data at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 7 TeV for three different inclusive processes: jet, \(Z\)-boson and \(t\bar{t}\) production. Two tunes, A15-MG5aMCNLO-TTBAR, applicable only for \(t\bar{t}\) processes, and A15-MG5aMCNLO, applicable in general for all processes, have been developed. The resulting Pythia 8 parameters of the NLO+PS matched setup are in good agreement with the standalone Pythia 8 tunes.

## 1 Introduction

Several Monte Carlo (MC) event generators use parton shower (PS), hadronisation and multiple interaction (MPI) models to enhance fixed-order partonic matrix element (ME) events, and produce full particle level predictions as similar as possible to real collider data. They can use either in-built leading-order matrix element calculation for the hard process, or use multileg or multiloop ME from other generators. These models are typically either approximations to high-multiplicity perturbative QCD calculations, or phenomenological attempts to address non-perturbative physics which is not understood from first principles; accordingly each model presents several free parameters which must be optimised to produce a reasonable description of measured observables. This optimisation process is known as _tuning_, and the resulting parameter sets are referred to as MC generator tunes.

ATLAS has previously used LHC Run 1 data to tune standalone Pythia 8 [1] generator [2; 3], as well as Pythia 8 using Powheg[4] or MadGraph5_aMC@NLO[5] ME inputs [6; 7]. In this note, a tune of NLO MadGraph5_aMC@NLO + PS Pythia 8 matched setup (using MC@NLO matching procedure [8]) has been attempted, using inclusive dijet, \(Z\)-boson and \(t\overline{t}\) events. The motivation is to check if a dedicated tune is needed for this setup.

In this setup, these three classes of observables are affected by the hard scattering ME as well as by the modelling of multiple partonic interactions, final state radiation (FSR) and initial state radiation (ISR). And indeed these are the dominant features seen in tuning. However, such a clean factorisation is not possible, and in practice shower modelling can affect underlying event observables, ISR changes the additional jet emissions while FSR is more sensitive to jet shapes, etc. The MadGraph5_aMC@NLO + Pythia 8 setup is expected to be widely used in ATLAS for comparison with Run 2 data, a reliable tune of this setup is therefore essential. Special care has been taken to do not include regions where this setup is not expected to give accurate predictions, such as extra jets in \(Z\)-boson events or activity in the forward region in \(t\overline{t}\) events.

As for the previous studies, the Rivet analysis toolkit [9] and the Professor MC tuning system [10] were used, at versions 2.2.0 and 1.4.0 respectively. The MadGraph5_aMC@NLO version used was 2.2.1, Pythia 8 version used was 8.186, with the PDFs taken from LHAPDF version 6.1.3 [11].

## 2 Tuning setup

### ATLAS measurements and observables

Several ATLAS measurements at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV of inclusive jets, \(Z\)-boson (\(Z\) is used to denote \(Z/\gamma^{*}\)) or \(t\overline{t}\) production are used to constrain the considered parameters of the Pythia8 MC generator (described later and presented in Table 3) and are briefly described in the following. The correlations among the various observables measured for a given process were not studied. Thus a set of observables, which are sufficiently statistically independent, was used in the tuning and are listed in Table 1. The last two columns, denoting weights for two tune candidates, will be explained in Section 3. The \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Z\) observables were measured using 2011 dataset, while inclusive jet measurements used only part of the 2010 dataset and thus show large statistical uncertainties.

#### Measurements from \(t\bar{t}\) production process

Three ATLAS \(t\bar{t}\) measurements at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV using 2011 dataset were used: \(t\bar{t}\) production with a veto on additional central jet activity - henceforth referred to as \(t\bar{t}\) gap fraction measurements [12], jet shapes measurements [13], and differential cross sections as a function of the jet multiplicity and jet transverse momentum [14].

From the first measurement, two observables were used: the inclusive gap fraction as a function of the leading-jet \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold, \(Q_{0}\), and as a function of the scalar transverse momentum sum of the additional jets, \(Q_{\rm sum}\). This measurement was performed in the dileptonic channel to ensure that the additional jets can easily be distinguished from the \(t\bar{t}\) decay products, and thus are mainly sensitive to ISR. The first observable is defined as \(f(Q_{0})=n(Q_{0})/N\) where \(N\) is the number of selected \(t\bar{t}\) events and \(n(Q_{0})\) the number of those events that do not contain an additional jet with \(p_{\rm T}>Q_{0}\) in a central rapidity interval. The second one is defined as \(f(Q_{\rm sum})=n(Q_{\rm sum})/N\) where \(n(Q_{\rm sum})\) is the number of \(t\bar{t}\) events in which the scalar transverse momentum sum of the additional high-\(p_{\rm T}\) jets in the rapidity interval is less than \(Q_{\rm sum}\).

Differential and integrated jet shapes as a function of the jet radius \(r\) were measured for light- and \(b\)-jets in five exclusive \(p_{\rm T}\) ranges of the jet. Top quark pair events are selected in both the single lepton and dilepton final states. These measurements are sensitive to the details of the parton-to-jet fragmentation processes, such as the value of \(\alpha_{S}\) used in the branchings of FSR, the fragmentation model and the underlying event. In this study only the differential light-jet shapes were used. They are defined as the average fraction of transverse momentum contained within an annulus of radius \(\Delta r\) around a cone of radius \(r\) around the jet axis. This can be expressed by the following formula:

\[\rho(r,\Delta r)=\frac{1}{\Delta r}\cdot\frac{1}{N_{\rm jets}}\cdot\sum_{\rm jets }\frac{p_{T}(r-\Delta r/2,r+\Delta r/2)}{p_{T}(0,R)}. \tag{1}\]

where \(R\) represents the maximum radius, and is set to 0.4, the radius used in the jet reconstruction algorithm. The \(b\)-jet shapes were not included, as previous ATLAS studies [7] showed that they cannot be modelled well enough.

The \(t\bar{t}\) production cross section was measured differentially in jet multiplicity and in jet transverse momentum in the single lepton channel, requiring events with one lepton and at least three jets. The jet multiplicity was measured for several different jet transverse momentum thresholds and the cross section with respect to the jet \(p_{\rm T}\) was measured separately for the five highest \(p_{\rm T}\) jets. The measurements were carried out without explicit separation between jets coming from \(t\bar{t}\) decays and additional jets. Among them, the differential cross sections as functions of the leading-jet \(p_{\rm T}\), of the fifth leading-jet \(p_{\rm T}\), of jet multiplicity for jets with \(p_{\rm T}\geqslant 25\) GeV and jet multiplicity for jets with \(p_{\rm T}\geqslant 80\) GeV are used. The overall normalisation of these observables is sensitive to higher-order QCD corrections. In order to reduce the effect of missing higher-order QCD corrections on the minimisation of the MC parameters, the predictions of the \(t\bar{t}\) + jets differential cross sections were normalised to the data, separately for each observable.

Recently, more ATLAS measurements of \(t\bar{t}\) production in \(pp\) collisions have been published such as differential cross sections as a function of kinematic variables whose dependence on theoretical models is minimal [15]. These measurements have not been included in this study since they were not available on time, although there are expected to be sensitive to QCD radiation.

#### Measurements from \(Z\)-boson production process

Four observables measured using \(Z\)-boson events with leptonic decays are used in this study. For events in the muon channel, that is \(Z\to\mu\mu\), the measurement \(Z\)\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectra is used. \(Z\to\ ee\) events were used to tune \(\phi_{\eta}^{*}\) spectra, which was found to be optimal to probe the low \(Z\)\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) domain of \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) production and is defined as \(\phi_{\eta}^{*}=\tan\left(\phi_{\mathrm{acop}}/2\right)\cdot\sin\left(\theta_{ \eta}^{*}\right)\), with \(\phi_{\mathrm{acop}}=\pi-\Delta\phi\) and \(\Delta\phi\) being the azimuthal opening angle between the two leptons. The angle \(\theta_{\eta}^{*}\) is defined by \(\cos\left(\theta_{\eta}^{*}\right)=\tanh\left[\left(\eta^{-}-\eta^{+}\right)/2\right]\) where \(\eta^{-}\) and \(\eta^{+}\) are the pseudorapidities of the negatively and positively charged lepton, respectively [16]. The \(\phi_{\eta}^{*}\) variable is strongly correlated to the \(Z\)\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

In addition, two observables among the \(Z\) underlying event ATLAS measurements [17] were used: the charged particle multiplicity and the charged particle transverse momentum sum. The properties of the underlying event were measured for an inclusive sample of events containing a \(Z\)-boson, decaying to an electron or muon pair. These distributions were measured in different regions relative to the direction of the \(Z\)-boson in each event and each region is sensitive to different effects. The "away" region is dominated by particles balancing the momentum of the \(Z\)-boson. The "transverse" region is sensitive to the underlying event, since it is by construction perpendicular to the direction of the \(Z\)-boson and hence it is expected to have less activity from the hard scattering process compared to the away region. The "toward" region is similarly unaffected by additional activity from the hard scatter. Thus, the most sensitive regions to the underlying event are the "toward" and "transverse" regions, and these were used in this study.

#### Measurements from inclusive jet production process

For inclusive jet production, ATLAS has performed several measurements with the data recorded in 2010 at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. The complete list of the observables used is presented in Table 1. This includes measurements of jet shapes, dijet azimuthal decorrelations, measurements of the jet activity in rapidity intervals bounded by a dijet system, results on multijet cross sections presented as three-to-two jet fractions, density of charged particle tracks with respect to the jet axis, jet mass, observables sensitive to the jet substructure (such as \(\tau_{21}\), \(\tau_{32}\),\(\sqrt{d_{12}}\) and \(\sqrt{d_{23}}\)), pseudorapidity dependence of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\), and observables sensitive to the underlying event.

### MadGraph5_aMC@NLO +Pythia 8 Monte Carlo samples

The MadGraph5_aMC@NLO generator was used to generate LHE files corresponding to the following processes. In all cases, a dynamic scale equal to the sum of the transverse mass of the outgoing partons is used.

* Two different \(\vec{t}\) samples are simulated: a dilepton sample with three million events and an inclusive sample with six million. The first one is used for gap fraction measurements, while the second one for jet shapes and differential cross section measurements.
* Analogously, the \(Z(\to\ ll)\) boson production samples were divided in two independent sets according to the lepton flavour, with two million events each. In this way, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{Z}}\) is tuned using the muon channel whereas the \(Z\)\(\phi^{*}\) using \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events.

* Two different samples were used for inclusive jet production. The default event generation with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO sets a minimum transverse momentum for final state particles from

the hard process. Due to the fast decrease of the production cross section with the jet transverse momentum [28], two samples with different \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) slices were generated: six million events with a low minimum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of 10 GeV and three million events with a higher minimum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (100 GeV). Even by adding this second sample, the statistics is not large enough to precisely model jet observables with high transverse momenta. Thus, it was checked that when removing the statistically limited observables, the tuning result does not change.

Subsequently the generated LHEs were showered using Pythia 8 generator, whose parameters were tuned. The PDF set used for the simulation of the hard processes was CT10 [29] which is a NLO PDF set. This choice was driven by the PDF used for NLO predictions in ATLAS. For Pythia 8, NNPDF2.3LO [30] (LO PDF) was used as was the case for A14 tune. For the calculation of NLO+PS subtraction terms, the _global_ recoil scheme is assumed for the first final state emission. Thus, the settings summarized in Table 2 and recommended by MadGraph5_aMC@NLO authors are used. In this scheme, the recoil of an emission is shared among all final state particles. Thus, the radiation pattern is unrelated to colour correlations. This is especially convenient for some matching algorithms, such as MC@NLO used in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, where a full analytic knowledge of the shower radiation pattern is needed to avoid double-counting. This approach will miss out on the colour coherence phenomena. Specifically, the phase space for subsequent emissions is larger than for the normal dipole algorithm ( _local_ recoil). Therefore the application of the global recoil option is only for the first one or few emissions of the shower.

### Tuned parameters

Seven parameters have been tuned which can be grouped in three: values of the strong coupling constant at the \(Z\)-boson mass and infrared cutoffs for ISR, FSR and MPI, and the primordial transverse momentum. For a detailed description of the parameters, the reader is referred to the Pythia 8 online documentation [31]. The set of relevant parameters in Pythia 8 are SpaceShower:* and TimeShower:* for the initial and final state parton shower parameters, and MultipartonInteractions:* for multiple partonic interactions parameters. One "beam-remnant" parameter related to the primordial \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) is also tuned. In Pythia 8 an effective primordial \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) is parameterised with \(\sigma\)(Q), the width of the two-dimensional Gaussian distribution of the initiator primordial \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) (so that <\(k_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}\)> = \(\sigma^{2}\)). In particular, the primordialKThard parameter is tuned which

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline Pythia8 settings & Value \\ \hline \hline SpaceShower:pTmaxMatch & 1 \\ \hline SpaceShower:pTmaxFudge & 1 \\ \hline SpaceShower:MEcorrections & off \\ TimeShower:pTmaxMatch & 1 \\ TimeShower:pTmaxFudge & 1 \\ TimeShower:MEcorrections & off \\ TimeShower:globalRecoil & on \\ TimeShower:limitPTmaxGlobal & on \\ TimeShower:nMaxGlobalRecoil & 1 \\ TimeShower:globalRecoilMode & 2 \\ TimeShower:nMaxGlobalBranch & 1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

regulates the a narrow Gaussian intrinsic transverse momentum for the hard process incoming partons. The tuned parameters are listed in Table 3, with a very brief definition, along with their sampling range used for the current tune. The rest of the parameters were left unchanged from the A14 tune, which was based on the Monash tune [32].

Five hundred parameter points were randomly sampled from the hypercube of these parameter ranges. Each bin of each observable was parameterised as a 7-dimensional third order polynomial, based on the 500 sampled tune points in the parameter hypercube. These parameterisations were then used to calculate a \(\chi^{2}\) with respect to the reference data, which was numerically minimised in the parameter space to find the best tune point. The correlation of the experimental uncertainties are not included in the \(\chi^{2}\). Weight factors were used in the \(\chi^{2}\) and degree of freedom, \(N_{\text{df}}\), calculation to place increased emphasis on certain observables; these weights are also listed in Table 1. Larger weights are used for \(Z\)-boson and \(t\bar{t}\) observables. The Drell-Yan process \(q\bar{q}\to\ Z/\gamma^{*}\to\ l^{+}l^{-}\) does not contain any coloured parton in the final state that can produce QCD FSR and therefore provides a clean environment to study ISR. Since good modelling of \(t\bar{t}\) events is one of the aims of this tune but fewer measurements are available, these are weighted to increase their relevance. The two different weight columns are for a dedicated \(t\bar{t}\) tune and for a general tune, as explained in the next section.

The strategy was to tune only to observables which may be modelled by this NLO+PS matched setup, for example many additional jets in final state is better modeled by multileg generators, so no attempt is made to describe such observables. The \(Z\)-boson \(p_{\text{T}}\) and \(\phi^{*}\) are mostly sensitive to ISR; while for \(Z\) underlying event observables, namely \(N_{\text{ch}}\) and \(\sum p_{\text{T}}\) as a function of the \(Z\)\(p_{\text{T}}\), MPI plays an important role. Due to modelling limitations, the \(Z\)\(p_{\text{T}}\) spectrum is tuned up to 50 GeV and \(\phi^{*}\) is tuned up to 0.5. The underlying event distributions are only expected to be described at low \(p_{\text{T}}^{Z}\) as well. This is because without multileg ME, additional jets produced with association with a \(Z\)-boson cannot be modelled.

These region exclusions and the tuning weights (and final sampling ranges) were chosen by using observable sensitivities to find data tensions, and by iteration. Weights were assigned following the principles that important features measured in a small number of distributions would receive an increased weight to balance them against features for which many histograms were available.

## 3 Results

In this section, the results of the tuning are presented and compared to other ATLAS tunes. The aim of this study is to test the universality of the Pythia 8 tunes in presence of NLO+PS matching with

MadGraph45_AMC@NLO. The obtained tune, using all three hard processes: inclusive jets, \(Z\)-boson and \(t\overline{t}\) production, is named A15-MG5aMCNLO. In addition, since this matched setup is used extensively in ATLAS to simulate \(t\overline{t}\) events, a dedicated tune optimised for the description of \(t\overline{t}\) observables, named A15-MG5aMCNLO-TTBAR tune, was also developed. The right two columns in Table 1 show the weights used for these two tunes.

Table 4 lists the tune parameters for these two new tunes, along with some previous ATLAS tunes: A14, ATTBAR [7] and AZ [6]. The values in parenthesis indicate that the parameters were not tuned and the quoted values correspond to those from the tune that was taken as a basis. Fig. 1 shows a comparison of the obtained tuned parameters of these ATLAS tunes in a graphical format. The comparisons in each case are performed using the mentioned Pythia8 tune applied to the same LHE files generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO.

The A14 tune (in particular A14-NNPDF tune) was used a basis. This tune was developed in 2014 using ATLAS \(\sqrt{s}=7\,\text{TeV}\) measurements of \(t\overline{t}\), \(Z\)-boson and inclusive jet production. The parton shower and MPI parameters of Pythia 8 were tuned aiming to describe a wide variety of event topologies. For that, the Monash tune was taken as a basis, but fewer parameters were tuned. Additionally, observables from the \(Z\)-boson underlying event as well as \(t\overline{t}\) jet multiplicity and jet \(p_{\text{T}}\) distributions are included of which measurements were not available at that time.

The AZ Pythia 8 standalone tune is a dedicated tune for describing the softer part of the \(p_{\text{T}}^{Z}\) spectrum which is necessary for precision electroweak measurements. This tune was developed before A14 and was restricted to the low \(Z\)-boson \(p_{\text{T}}\) range where parton shower effects dominate, by tuning ISR parameters, and adjusting MPI cutoff.

The ATTBAR is a Pythia 8 standalone tune with optimised ISR and FSR parameters derived using \(t\overline{t}\) measurements at \(\sqrt{s}=7\,\text{TeV}\). The aim of this was to provide accurate modelling of parton showering effects in \(t\overline{t}\) events which is crucial for a precise measurement of the mass of the top quark. The MPI \(p_{\text{T}}\) cutoff was adjusted to match the \(Z\)-boson underlying event data measured by ATLAS at 7 TeV. This tune was also applied to the NLO+PS generators Powheg +Pythia 8 and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO +Pythia 8. For the latter, two configurations were used: the global recoil and the local recoil. Although the global recoil configuration is theoretically more consistent, the best agreement with data was achieved with the tuning using the local recoil. Thus, the comparisons with this tune are performed using the ATTBAR-MG5aMCNLO tune with the local recoil setting in Pythia 8.

Table 4: Comparison of the obtained tuned parameters with other tunes. The values in parenthesis indicate that the parameters were not tuned and the quoted values correspond to those from the tune that was taken as basis. For ATTBAR, the numbers correspond to ATTBAR-MG5aMCNLO tune obtained for the matched setup NLO+PS.

In Figs. 2-4, the performance of the new tunes can be seen for \(t\overline{t}\), \(Z\) and jet observables, compared with the currently used ATLAS tunes for those processes. All distributions shown were used in the tune except the \(b\)-jet shape in \(t\overline{t}\) events and two jet observables, as specified in the captions. Additional comparisons can be found in the Auxiliary material.

While a significant overall improvement is not seen, compared to currently used tunes, many interesting features can be observed.

* As shown in Fig. 2, dedicated \(t\overline{t}\) tunes describe better the gap fraction observables which are very sensitive to ISR. Similar effects are observed in the jet multiplicity in \(t\overline{t}\) lepton+jets events, in particular for events with five jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) above 25 GeV. The various tunes describe the measured \(t\overline{t}\)\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum and jet shapes similarly and reasonably well. The most significant differences are visible in the first and last bin of the leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectra. In general, predicted \(b\)-jet shapes in \(t\overline{t}\) events are broader than measured in data, as already observed in Ref. [7].

Figure 2: The new A15-MG5aMCNLO, A15-MG5aMCNLO-TTBAR, A14 and ATTBAR tune predictions compared with ATLAS gap fraction [12], jet multiplicity and spectra [14], and jet shapes [13] measurements for \(t\overline{t}\) events. In all cases, same MadGraph5_aMC@NLO LHE inputs are showered. All distributions shown except the \(b\)-jet shape were used in the tune. The yellow shaded areas represent the data uncertainty.

* In Fig. 3 one can see that \(Z\)-boson observables are better described by tunes developed using those measurements. This may point to tensions in ISR parameters between the different measurements sensitive to it.
* Additionally, jet observables presented in Fig. 4 are better described by tunes developed using dijet measurements. Several observables measured in ATLAS are used in this case and, except the A15-MG5aMCNLO-TTBAR tune, all the rest look fairly similar. Distributions sensitive to the underlying event (transverse energy density and average density of charged particles) cannot be described by dedicated \(t\bar{t}\) tunes, while both A14 and the new general tune do it quite well. The A15-MG5aMCNLO tune describes the inclusive jet shapes best. In fact, they show some improvement over A14 as well. The internal substructure of jets is described reasonably well by the different tunes. Similarly, comparisons of the tunes for measurements sensitive to the additional jet activity in dijet events have been studied. The mean multiplicity of jets above the veto threshold in the rapidity interval bounded by the dijet system allows for quantifying perturbative QCD emission. In most of the phase-space regions, no major differences between the tunes has been observed for such observables.
* One of the features of the A14 tune was the significantly lower value of FSR \(\alpha_{S}\), which could have potentially be problematic to describe LEP jet rates [33] and jet shape observables [34], as the reduced value results in less additional jet activity. However, in the tunes derived here, FSR \(\alpha_{S}\) is restored close to the tuned value using LEP data by requiring a good description of \(t\bar{t}\) light-jet shapes. The obtained parameter is very similar to ATTBAR value, since the strategy of excluding the \(b\)-jet shapes is also followed here. Comparing the tuned MPI parameters to A14 values, they are seen to be very similar. The ISR parameters are seen to be compatible with A14 and with ATTBAR, which used the same PDF set. The value of primordial \(k_{\perp}\) is compatible with A14 and AZ. To conclude, the resulting Pythia 8 parameters of the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO matched setup are in good agreement with the standalone Pythia 8 tunes.

Fig. 5 shows the correlations between each tuning parameter coming from the MINUIT minimisation of the interpolation. A strong positive correlation between each \(\alpha_{S}\) and the respective \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cutoff is observed for ISR, FSR and MPI, which means changing one of the \(\alpha_{S}\) parameters also has a significant effect on the respective \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cutoff. With this, the strong sensitivity of some of the observables to the \(\alpha_{S}\) parameters translates into a weaker sensitivity to the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cutoff parameters. Additionally, the primordial \(k_{\mathrm{T,hard}}\) shows a strong correlation to both MPI parameters. Thus, changing the MPI parameters would also affect this beam remnants parameter.

Figure 3: Comparisons of different tune predictions with ATLAS data for \(Z\)-boson \(\phi^{*}\) (only region with \(\phi^{*}\)< 0.5 is used in the tune) [16] and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\) (only region with \(p_{T}<50\) GeV is tuned) [18] spectrum as well as sum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) density as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\)[17] (only low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region is tuned). In all cases, same MadGraph5_aMC@NLO LHE inputs are showered. All distributions shown were used in the tune in the specified ranges. The yellow shaded areas represent the data uncertainty.

Figure 4: The A15-MG5aMCNLO, A15-MG5aMCNLO-TTBAR and A14 tune predictions compared with ATLAS measurements of transverse energy flow [26], 3-to-2 jet ratio [22], jet shapes [19], jet substructure [24] and dijet production with a veto on additional central jet activity [22]. Only distributions in the the top right, mid left, bottom left and bottom right were used in the tune. In all cases, same MadGraph5_aMC@NLO LHE inputs are showered. The yellow shaded areas represent the data uncertainty.

## 4 Conclusions

Two new tunes for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO +Pythia 8 matched setup are presented, along with a detailed study of how different observables influence the tuned parameters. Generally, tunes for standalone Pythia 8 are used for these matched setups, but this exercise shows that some minor improvements may be possible using dedicated tunes. Overall the gains are small enough, so in ATLAS the plan will be to continue using A14 for this matched setup.
