## 1 Introduction

In the present note are summarized results of an evaluation of the first three microstrip detectors manufactured by ELMA factory in Russia which has expressed recently an interest to participate in the SCT construction. In the following pages will be described the design of detectors, measurement of basic electrical characteristics of the first prototypes and results will be compared to the SCT-ATLAS specifications for silicon microstrip detectors [1].

## 2 The design of ELMA 75 detectors

The design has been prepared in AUTOCAD 12 by NPI - MSU and the Institute of Physics. The set of thirteen masks were manufactured in Russia. First prototypes have been fabricated at ELMA factory on 4 \(\it inch\), 350 \(\mu m\) thick Wacker wafers having resistivity \((2-4)\)\(k\Omega.cm\).

With respect to the baseline specifications [11] the prototype detectors have been designed as single sided ones with capacitively coupled \(n^{+}\) read-out strips on \(n\)-type silicon. Read-out strips with a pitch 75 \(\mu m\) are isolated by individual floating \(p\)-stops and connected through the polysilicon resistors to bias rail.

One can see in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 the \(n\)-side and the \(p\)-side structures of the detector. An aluminium covering of the \(n\)-side is shown in Fig. 3. Both sides of the detector are equipped with guard rings. There are seven alternating \(p^{+}\) and \(n^{+}\) guard rings on the \(n\)-side and four \(p^{+}\) rings on the \(p\)-side. Geometric characteristics of the design are shown in Table 1.

Coupling dielectric consists of the silicon oxide and the silicon nitride layers. A position of \(AC\)-pads is the same as for HAMMATSU 75 detectors [3] and is suitable for the \(Z\)- and \(R\)-\(\phi\)-modules.

There are forteen different test structures on the wafer surrounding the strip detector. Fig. 4 shows the AUTOCAD 12 layout of the \(n\)-side wafer with a number of large area diodes, large capacitors, MOS capacitors, polysilicon resistors, test structures with \(n^{+}\) and \(p^{+}\) implants and diodes with the guard rings.

## 3 Measurement of basic electrical characteristics

In this section we would like to give the details of the measurement procedures and a critical review of the relevant quantities for the certification. All tested detectors have been cut out of the wafers and measured at a room temperature.

For measurement have been used automatic Probe Station PS2S150E by Dr. G. Maehlum (Germany) at University of Geneva equipped with several probe heads with vacuum support model PH100 (Karl Suss, Germany). The used electrical equipment are listed below.

### The leakage current and bulk capacitance

For the detectors the total leakage current is fairly good indicator of imperfections. The total leakage current \(I_{tot}\) taken from the bias line as a function of reverse bias voltage is shown in Fig. 5 for three tested prototype detectors. Prototype #1 has very sheer \(I\)-\(V\) characteristic and therefore it has been excluded from further investigations.

Figure 5: Tot al leakage current as a function of the reverse bias voltage.

A stability of the leakage current has been measured for detector #3 within 48 hours at \(V_{b}=150\;V\), (shown at Fig. 6). One can recognize that \(I_{tot}\) increases on 5% during the first five hours and then \(I_{tot}\) is decreasing function of time. Measurement shown in Fig. 6 has been carried out after glueing of the detector on ceramics and bonding to fanin. Presumably, this is the reason of higher values of \(I_{tot}\) than those obtained in previous measurement with unbonded detector (see Fig. 5).

A bulk capacitance \(C_{b}\) has been measured on the detector as capacitance between the back plane and the bias rail. The measured \(C\)-\(V\) characteristics of detectors #2 and #3 are shown in Fig. 7a and Fig. 7b at two frequences 10 \(kHz\) and 100 \(kHz\). The \(C\)-\(V\) characteristics behave like \(V_{b}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\) for \(V_{b}<35\;V\) and beyond this value the \(C_{b}\) decreases nearly linearly up to the constant value \(C_{b}\;\sim 1\;nF\). The full depletion voltage has been evaluated as the cross point of these two stright lines with the result \(V_{fd}(10\;kHz)=84\;V\) and \(V_{fd}(10\;kHz)=70\;V\) for detectors #2 and #3, respectively. The observed frequency dependence in the bulk capacitance was such that \(10\;kHz\) values were always larger than those measured at \(100\;kHz\).

From the \(C\)-\(V\) characteristics one can determine a doping concentration \(N_{d}\) and/or a bulk resistivity \(\rho\) of the silicon wafers [4]:

Figure 6: A time dependence of the total leakage current for detector 3.

\[C_{b}=S.\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{2.V_{b}.\mu.\rho}}, \tag{1}\]

\[\rho.\mu=\frac{1}{q.N_{d}}, \tag{2}\]

where \(\epsilon\) is dielectric constant of \(Si-1.06\cdot 10^{-12}F/cm\), \(S\) is an area of the detector - \(33.756\;cm^{2}\), \(\mu\) denotes an electron mobility (\(1590\;cm^{2}/Vs\)\([10]\)) and \(q\) is an electron charge.

Since a doping concentration \(N_{d}\) is not accurately known we have calculated \(\rho\) directly from equ. (1) at \(V_{b}=20\;V\) with the result: \(\rho=4.1\;k\Omega.cm\) for detector #2 and \(\rho=4.9\;k\Omega.cm\) for detector #3 at frequency \(10\;kHz\). These values are slightly higer than nominal values shown by producer as expected after a processing the wafers through the chain of operations during the production of detectors [9].

As a cross check, the measured values of the bulk resistivity and the full depletion

Figure 7: **a)** The bulk capacitance as a function of the reverse bias voltage for detector 2.

**b)** The bulk capacitance as a function of the reverse bias voltage for detector 3.

voltages have been used for a calculation of the depletion thickness: \(d=349\;\mu m\) and \(352\;\mu m\) for detectors #2 and #3, respectively, which are comparable with the thickness given by producer.

For comparison, the \(C\)-\(V\) and \(I\)-\(V\) characteristics of a planar diode (\(S=.387\;cm^{2}\)) have been also measured on the test structures of detector #2 (see Fig. 8a and Fig. 8b). A shape of the \(C\)-\(V\) characteristic is similar to those measured on the strip detectors but, contrary, no frequency dependence has been observed. The estimated values for the full depletion volt age (\(V_{\!f\!d}=90\;V\)), bulk resistivity (\(\rho=3.9\;k\Omega.cm\)) and for a depletion thickness (\(d=344\;\mu m\)) agree well with previous measurement carried out on the strip detector #2.

The measured constant values of \(C_{b}\) for fully depleted devices, \(C_{b}=\;\sim 12\;pF\) for the test diode and \(C_{b}=\;\sim 1\;nF\) for the strip detector, are in reasonable agreement with those estimated according to the relation \(C_{b}=\epsilon.\frac{S}{d}\): \(C_{est}=11.7\;pF\) and \(1\;nF\), respectively, where for the wafer thickness we have used the calculated value \(d=350\;\mu m\).

Figure 8: **a)** The \(I\)-\(V\) characteristic of the test structure diode of the detector 2

**b)** The \(C\)-\(V\) characteristic of the test structure diode of the detector 2.

The \(I\)-\(V\) characteristics of the diode and the strip detectors are very different in shape and in the absolute value (compare Fig. 8b to Fig. 5). For the diode, the total leakage current is characterized by a presence of an approximate plateau with a slow growth between 100 \(V\) and 200 \(V\) only. It means that any contribution coming from the surface current can be neglected at least for \(V_{b}<100\)\(V\) and the leakage current is mainly generated by the intrinsic charge carriers [4]:

\[I_{gen}=\frac{q.N_{Si}.S.(2\epsilon.\rho.\mu.V_{b})^{\frac{1}{2}}}{2.\tau}, \tag{3}\]

where \(N_{Si}\) denotes the charge carrier density (\(1.5\cdot 10^{10}\)\({e}{lect\,rms\,/cm^{3}}\)) and \(\tau\) is a generation lifetime.

For a measured current \(I_{gen}=12\,nA\) on the plateau, the equ. (3) provides a rough approach of generation lifetime which is equal to one milisecond in fair agreement with direct measurement on Wacker wafers [9].

The equ. (3) also allows to find some lower limit of the total leakage current of the strip detector. If one extrapolates the measured value of \(I_{gen}=12\,nA\) in diode

Figure 9: A dependence of the single strip current on the reverse bias voltage measured on \(DC\) pad.

to the full size strip detector having 87 times greater area, then an expected total current \(I_{tot}>1\)\(\mu A\). This lower limit is about 15 times (4 times) smaller than the actual leakage current found at \(V_{b}=100\)\(V\) on detector #2 (#3). Such observation seems to show on several local defects which are present in the detector #2.

To this end we have tested a current coming from the single \(n^{+}\) read-out strips (\(DC\)-pads) at \(V_{b}=150\)\(V\) and \(V_{b}=200\)\(V\) of the detector #2. A typical dependence of the single strip current as a function of the reverse bias voltage is shown in Fig. 9. One can observe a sharp decrease of the current when detector becomes fully depleted and a slow increase of the current between \(V_{b}=100\)\(V\) and \(V_{b}=200\)\(V\). One can reveal in Fig. 10 that a major part of strips provides current on a level of several \(nA\), \(\langle I_{ss}\rangle=2.73\)\(nA\) at \(V_{b}=150\)\(V\) and \(\langle I_{ss}\rangle=3.49\)\(nA\) at \(V_{b}=200\)\(V\). Supposing that all strips are 'good' then the expected total leakage current of the detector will be \(I_{tot}(150\)\(V)=2.1\)\(\mu A\) and \(I_{tot}(200\)\(V)=2.7\)\(\mu A\). Both values are about two-three times greater than the lower limit extrapolated from the diode measurement. This seems to show on relatively low level of the surface currents and/or good interstrip isolation, which characterize good quality of the detector.

However, there are also nonacceptable strips in the detector, namely one having

Figure 10: The single strip current of the odd strips of the overdepleted detector 2.

current \(I_{ss}>10\;\mu A\) which is comparable to the \(I_{tot}\), probably due to local defects on the \(p\)-stops and/or some scratches on the \(p\)-side. The upper limit for an acceptable single strip current is \(50\;nA\) at \(V_{b}=150\;V\) according to the specifications [11] (dash-and-dot stright line in Fig. 10). Thus, one can conclude that 97.7% of all strips of the detector #2 are acceptable since in nine cases from 385 tested strips the \(I_{ss}>50\;nA\). Corresponding number for detector #3 is greater than 98%.

### P-stop interstrip isolation

The \(p\)-stop isolation between the neighbouring \(n^{+}\) read-out strips is well demonstrated by a behaviour of the interstrip capacitance \(C_{i\,s}\) and the interstrip resistance \(R_{i\,s}\) as a function of the reverse bias voltage.

The set up for the simplified measurement of \(R_{i\,s}\) is illustrated in Fig. 11. A Keithley 230 Low Voltage Source was used to supply the voltage Vapp to the strip in the interval \((-2\;V,+2\;V)\) with a step \(0.1\;V\). Under the same assumptions as for the evaluation of the bias resistor (see sec. 3.3 below) one can conclude that [7]:

\[\frac{1}{R_{i\,s}}=\frac{dI_{meas}}{dV_{app}}\;\;\;\;\;{\rm at}\;\;\;\;\;V_{ app}=0\;V. \tag{4}\]

Fig. 12 displays the values of \(R_{i\,s}\) for detector #2 calculated according to the equ. (4) as a function of the reverse bias voltage. From the shape of this curve the detector is observed to become fully depleted at around 90 \(V\) when the interstrip isolation rises steeply on four orders of magnitude. The full depletion voltage agrees well with those deduced from the \(C\)-\(V\) characteristics. The estimated value of an interstrip isolation, \(R_{i\,s}\sim 10\;G\Omega\), seems to be satisfactory to inhibit resistive charge sharing between neighbouring \(n^{+}\) strips [2, 6].

Figure 11: The set up for measurement of an interstrip resistance.

An interstrip capacitance \(C_{is}\) has been determined as one half of the measured capacitance between the central strip and two nearest neighbour strips. In the setup the strips beyond the nearest neighbours have been left as floating. A plot of the \(C_{is}\) dependence on the reverse bias voltage for frequencies 10 \(kHz\) and 100 \(kHz\) measured on the detector #3 is shown in Fig. 13. The frequency dependence of the \(C_{is}\) is similar to those found for bulk capacitance of an underdepleted detector (see Fig. 7b). However, it is just opposite when the detector becomes fully depleted. The achieved interstrip capacitance is \(C_{is}=0.74\)\(pF/cm\) at 100 \(kHz\) and \(C_{is}=0.37\)\(pF/cm\) at 10 \(kHz\). It is worth to mentione that again the \(V_{fd}=70-75\)\(V\) (see Fig. 13) is in accord with the \(C_{b}\)-\(V_{b}\) estimate for detector #3 (see Fig. 7b).

### Measurement of the bias resistor

Resistance of the polysilicon bias resistor has been evaluated on the test structures. Measured currents going through four tested resistors have demonstrated the direct proportionality with the applied voltages (Fig. 14). An average value achieved for

Figure 12: The interstrip isolation as a function of the reverse bias voltage for detector 2.

the bias resistor, \(R_{b}=2.33\pm 0.07\)\(M\Omega\), is slightly above the range given by [11].

For measurement of \(R_{b}\) on a strip detector we have used the method which is similar to one described in paper [5]. The set up for the measurement is illustrated in Fig. 15. The \(DC\)-pads of three \(n^{+}\) strips have been probed and to the central strip the voltage was applied from \(-100\,mV\) up to \(+100\,mV\) with a step of \(10\,mV\). Measured current on the central strip was found to be a linear function of an applied voltage and resistivity was estimated as \(R=dV_{app}/dI_{meas}\).

It is supposed in further analysis that bias resistors as well as the interstrip resistivity and the single strip leakage currents are the same for all three probed strips and also, the single strip currents do not change with the applied voltage. Under these assumptions one can show that

\[R=\frac{dV_{app}}{dI_{meas}}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_{b}}+\frac{2}{R_{is}}}, \tag{5}\]

where \(R_{is}\) stands for an interstrip resistance. The equ. (5) is valid for both cases when the adjacent strips to the central one are grounded or they are left as floating.

Figure 13: A dependence of the interstrip capacitance on the reverse bias voltage for detector 3.

Figure 14: Measurement of four polysilicon bias resistors on the test structures of detector 2.

Figure 15: The set up for measurement of the bias resistor.

Measured values of \(R\) (equ. (5)) as a function of the reverse bias voltage are shown in Fig. 16 (adjacent strips were grounded). Result with the floating adjacent strips is similar and coincides within 5% with one shown in Fig. 16.

One can distinquish two regions in Fig. 16, where the detector is underdepleted (\(R_{i\,s}\ll R_{b}\)) and \(R\sim R_{i\,s}/2\), and the region when the detector is overdepleted (\(R_{i\,s}\gg R_{b}\)) and consenquently, \(R=R_{b}\). An average received value of \(R_{b}=2.46\pm 0.04\;M\Omega\) is in good agreement with previous measurement on the test structures.

A rapid raise of the resistance with the reverse bias voltage over the interval \(dV_{b}\sim 5\;V\) demonstrates an actual spread of the full depletion voltage along the strip. This spread is a consequence mainly of a fluctuation of the wafer thickness and inhomogeneity of the bulk resistivity. The corresponding quantitative estimates are \(\pm 10\;\mu m\) and \(\pm 3\%\) for a spread of \(dV_{\it fd}=5\;V\).

Figure 16: Resistance (equ. 5) as a function of the reverse bias voltage for detector 2.

### Coupling capacitance

The coupling capacitance between the \(AC\) metal read-out strip and the \(n^{+}\) implant strip isolates the bias voltage and leakage current from the front-end of the read-out chip. This capacitance is a part of the total capacitance with respect to ground seen by the front-end chip and therefore affects the noise of the chip.

The coupling capacitance \(C_{c}\) measured between the \(AC\) and \(DC\) pads of a strip versus frequency is shown in Fig. 17. The capacitance is nearly constant up to frequency \(\sim 10^{3}\)\(Hz\) and then, as expected [5], the \(C_{c}\) is a decreasing function of frequency. Thus, at low frequences the achieved value of \(C_{c}=12\)\(pF/cm\) is in the limit [11].

A coupling capacitance measured between the \(AC\)-pads and the bias rail for odd strips of the detector #2 is displayed in Fig. 18a. One can see that the coupling capacitance for six strips from 385 measured ones is out of the range defined as \(0.75\langle C_{c}\rangle-1.5\langle C_{c}\rangle\) by the specifications [11] (dash-and-dot lines in Fig. 18a).

The current flowing through coupling dielectric has been measured at \(50\)\(V\) applied to the bias rail. The measured values for odd strips of detector #2 are shown in

Figure 17: A dependence of the coupling capacitance on frequency for detector 3.

Fig. 18b. For a major part of strips the current is fluctuating around \(\sim 2\ pA\) but there are 16 strips among 385 tested ones with the current which is at least 1000 times greater than an average value and, in total, 22 strips with a current greater than 8 \(pA\). It is worth to mention that in five cases the 'bad' strips had both the coupling capacitance and the current out of the allowed limit. Thus, one can conclude that 17 strips, i. e. 4.4% of all measured strips of the detector #2 are not acceptable [11].

We have also tested the breaks down of coupling capacitors on the test structures. The capacitor with dielectric consisting of silicon oxide and silicon nitride has weared well 200 \(V\) and a thinner capacitor with \(SiO_{2}\) only breaks down at 180 \(V\).

A measurement of resistance of the metal strips has resulted in \(R=53\ \Omega/cm\) which is 2.5 times greater than a recommended value 20 \(\Omega/cm\)[11].

## 5 Conclusion

An evaluation of the first prototype detectors manufactured by ELMA factory has been carried out with the probe station at the University of Geneva. The measurements of the \(I\)-\(V\) and \(C\)-\(V\) characteristics, the interstrip resistence and capacitance, the polysilicon bias resistors as well as the strip by strip check of the leakage current, coupling capacitance and shorts through coupling dielectric are rather encouraging. On the other side, several measured characteristics are still out of the range given by the SCT-ATLAS specifications. A development has to concentrate on how to avoid during a technological processes the existing local defects along the strips and shorts through coupling dielectric. Also must be enlarged a conductivity of the metal strips and improved the strip identification on the detector. It is also necessary to use standard Wacker wafers with \(300\,\mu m\) thickness and higher resistivity \(4-6\)\(k\Omega.cm\) in the next batch of detectors and to develop the SCT-ATLAS 97 design.
