desirable control of the systematic uncertainties to a precision of better than 1% for \(E_{T}<\) 1 TeV and to about 10% for \(E_{T}\) of about 3 TeV. The jet cross-section measurement can be used for the determination of \(\alpha_{s}\). It was shown[2] that at LHC a measurement of \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) up to scales of order TeV can be achieved with a 10% accuracy.

The measurement of di-jet events and their properties can be used to constrain the parton densities inside the proton, in various kinematic regions of \(Q^{2}\) and \(x\). In Figure 1_(b)_ the expected range in \(x\) and \(Q^{2}\) accesible with the di-jet differential cross-section measurement is shown. For a transverse energy threshold of 180 GeV, most of the events have \(Q^{2}\) values of about \(10^{5}\) and values of \(x\) between 2\(\cdot 10^{-3}\) and 0.5.

The di-jet invariant mass and angular distributions can be used to search for new physics. Studies have shown that the di-jet angular distribution has an excellent discovery capability for quark compositeness. An integral luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) will allow excluding quark substructure at 95% CL, if the constituent interaction constant is of the order of 40 TeV (see figure 2_(a)_).

## 3 Photon Physics

Direct photon measurements can provide important constraints on parton distributions, especially on the gluon distribution in the proton. The detection of photons at hadron collider is a challenging task due to the large background from jet production, where fluctuations can mimic the signature of a photon.

As an example in ATLAS it was found that for a photon efficiency of 80% a rejection factor against jets of larger than 3x10\({}^{3}\) can be achieved for \(E_{T}>\) 40 GeV, thus providing a good signal-to-background ratio. The selection at ATLAS will be based on a trigger demanding an isolated photon of \(E_{T}>\) 60 GeV within \(|\eta|<\) 2.5. This gives a value of the Bjorken-\(x\) of 5\(\cdot\)10\({}^{-4}\).

## 4 Lepton Physics

The measurement of the Drell-Yan lepton pair production and the production of \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons (with a leptonic decay to electrons or muons) will allow one to constrain the quark and anti-quark densities of the proton at a scale given by the invariant mass of the lepton pair (\(W/Z\) mass respectively) over a wide range in Bjorken-\(x\). For example, the measurement of \(Z\) boson production cross-section allows one to cover the range of 3\(\cdot\)10\({}^{-4}<x<\) 0.1 in Bjorken-\(x\) at \(Q^{2}\) = 8\(\cdot\)10\({}^{3}\) GeV\({}^{2}\).

## 5 Hard Diffractive Scattering

During the last few years the understanding of diffractive phenomena has received revived attention due to the observation of hard diffractive events in several experiments. Thus, the study of hard diffractive scattering at LHC becomes an important topic of the physics program of the involved exper

iments. An extension of the LHC detectors in the forward region (beyond pseudo-rapidities of \(|\eta|\) = 5) is presently under study, in order to increase the acceptance for charged particles from inelastic interactions (possibly including a momentum measurement) and to provide tagging and measurement of leading protons from elastic and diffractive interactions.

## 6 Properties of minimum-bias events

At the LHC, minimum-bias events will make up the 23 interactions per bunch crossing at high luminosity. In order to understand precisely their contribution to the measured quantities for the hard scattering events of interest, a detailed knowledge of the structure of the minimum-bias events is required. In Figure 2_(b)_ the charged particle density in minimum-bias events at LHC energies is shown as a function of pseudorapidity. Six models, tuned on CDF data, were used for this calculation. There is a difference of a factor 2 in the expected charged particle density in the central region, for models which are able to describe CDF data. Each minimum-bias event is expected to contribute from charged particles about 0.5 to 1 GeV per unit rapidity and unit azimuth to the transverse energy.

## 7 Conclusions

The LHC will provide a large sample of events with high \(p_{T}\) signatures for QCD studies. It will extend the kinematic range to values of \(Q^{2}\), the hard scale of the partonic process, of the order of TeV\({}^{2}\). The fraction of the proton momentum attributed to a parton will reach values below \(10^{-5}\), while keeping the hard scattering scale above 100 GeV\({}^{2}\).

A precise knowledge and understanding of QCD processes is important for the studies of the Higgs boson(s) and for searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model, where QCD represents a large part of the background.
