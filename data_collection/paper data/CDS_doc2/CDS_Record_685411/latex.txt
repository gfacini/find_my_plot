###### Abstract

The discovery potential of the future LHC general purpose experiments, ATLAS and CMS, of the Standard Model Higgs Boson and of Supersymmetric Higgs bosons in MSSM is summarized in this paper. A special emphasis is given to the recent ATLAS study on the feasibility of the SM Higgs discovery in the intermediate mass range using the Vector Boson Fusion production mechanism.

## 1 Introduction

The LEP experiments have provided precise measurements of the physical parameters of the electroweak model. The agreement with the Standard Model is good, and the constraints imposed on the missing parameter of the model, the Higgs mass, are quite tight. Thus, although the theoretical upper limit for the Higgs mass is around 1 TeV, in order to preserve the consistence of the model, a Standard Model fit of the experimental data shows that it cannot exceed the value of 196 GeV (C.L. = 95%), the most probable value being \(88^{+53}_{-35}\) GeV [1]. Moreover, the direct Higgs searches at LEP have provided a lower limit at 114.1 GeV, with a 95% of confidence level [2]

The discovery and the measurement of the characteristics of the Standard Model Higgs boson are some of the most important physics motivations of the future general purpose LHC experiments: ATLAS and CMS. The LHC accelerator will in fact provide \(pp\) interactions at the center of mass energy of 14 TeV. The design luminosity is \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\), corresponding at 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) collected in one year, but at the beginning the luminosity is expected to be lower: \(2\cdot 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\), corresponding to 20 fb\({}^{-1}\) in the first year of data taking.

## 2 The Standard Model Higgs Boson

The studies of ATLAS and CMS collaborations have been performed over the full mass range theoretically permitted for the Higgs boson, \(i.e.,\ 100\ {\rm GeV}<M_{H}<1\) TeV.

Figure 1 (left) shows the Higgs branching ratios as a function of the mass. As can be seen, the main decay channel is \(b\bar{b}\) (\(\sigma\cdot\)BR\(=20\) pb if \(M_{H}=120\) GeV) if the mass does not exceed \(\simeq 130\) GeV, but the huge QCD 2 \(b\)-jet production background (\(\sigma\cdot\)BR\(=500\ \mu\)b) makes this channel unfeasible, unless the associated production with a \(W\) boson or a \(t\bar{t}\) pair is considered.

Despite the small branching ratio, also the \(\gamma\gamma\) decay channel can be used. The feasibility of this channel depends strongly on the EM calorimeters performances and granularities of the two experiments. In fact, one of the main backgrounds in this channel is the \(\gamma j\) production: if the jet is composed by an energetic \(\pi^{0}\) and a number of non-energetic particles, the photons coming from the \(\pi^{0}\) are angularly very close, and if the angular granularity of the EM calorimeter is not small enough, they can easily simulate a single photon.

The decay of the Higgs into two \(Z\) bosons can be used over a large mass range: the \(ZZ\to 4l\) final state, in fact, provides a clear, almost background free signature, with very high significances, up to \(\mathfrak{2}\), after \(30\ {\rm fb}^{-1}\). The limitation at low masses (\(\simeq 130\) GeV) of this channel is due to the strong decreasing of \(H\to ZZ\) BR below the \(ZZ\) production threshold, while the upper limit of feasibility (\(\simeq 600\) GeV) is given by the decreasing of Higgs inclusive production rate. In fact, at large Higgs mass, it is necessary to look for channels with higher BR as \(H\to WW\to l\nu qq\).

The overall SM Higgs discovery potential (ATLAS \(+\) CMS) is

The significance drop shown by fig. 2 around \(M_{H}=160\) GeV is due to the decreasing of \(H\to ZZ\), in proximity of the opening of the \(H\to WW\) channel with the \(W\) bosons on mass shell, suggesting this decay channel as the most promising in this mass region.

The best results in this channel are obtained looking at the Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) production mechanism. It consists in the fusion of two vector bosons radiated by the incoming quarks in the boson bremsstrahlung process [3]. This production process is characterized by the presence of two very energetic jets in the forward and backward region of the detector, due to the fragmentation and hadronization processes of the quarks which emitted the vector bosons. Moreover, the lack of color exchange in the initial state leads to a reduced hadronic activity in the central region of the detector. Thus, the application of forward jet tagging and central jet veto techniques reduces drastically the backgrounds. The ATLAS collaboration has performed a careful investigation on the feasibility of this channel in both leptonic and hadronic \(W\) final states [4]. Figure 1 (right) shows the results in the \(H\to WW\to l\nu\,\nu\) channel. These studies, still in progress, show that the reduced significance around 160 GeV can be filled by the VBF production mechanism.

## 3 Supersymmetric Higgs Bosons

In the Supersymmetric scenarios, the Higgs sector structure as well as the Higgs channel decays and parameters are strictly model dependent. The most common Supersymmetric Scenario, the Minimal Supersymmetric extention of the Standard Model, predicts five Higgs bosons (\(h,H,A,H^{\pm}\)) and two free parameter, \(\tan\!\beta\) and \(M_{A}\). Figure 2 (right) shows the limits of a \(5\sigma\) discovery (ATLAS + CMS for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\)) in the \(\tan\!\beta\)-\(M_{A}\) plane for various Higgs bosons and decay channels. This results are obtained in a scenario of maximal stop mixing. The LEP exclusion region is also shown. In most of the plane more than one Higgs is visible.

## 4 Conclusion

The studies performed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations show that the existence of a Standard model Higgs boson can be proved (or excluded) after 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), \(i.e.\), two years of data taking. The Vector Boson Fusion production channels have a relevant role especially in the intermediate mass range, where the \(H\to ZZ\) channels fail due to a drop in the branching ratio.

The presence of Minimal Supersimmetric Higgs bosons would be discovered also after 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) over the whole \(\tan\!\beta\)-m\({}_{A}\) parameters plane.
