###### Abstract

This note presents the study of some R parity violating supersymmetric top decays in Atlas.

Introduction.

Supersymmetry is one of the most promising theory beyond the Standard Model, and its study is an important goal of the LHC. For what concerns Atlas, there are already some studies of the detector potential for different channels [1]. This contribution will focus on the case where the R-parity (\(R_{p}\)) is broken. In this case, the superpotential is the most general, and the following terms are present:

\[W_{RPV}=\lambda_{ijk}L_{i}L_{j}\bar{E}_{k}+\lambda^{\prime}_{ijk}L_{i}Q_{j} \bar{D}_{k}+\lambda^{\prime\prime}_{ijk}\bar{U}_{i}\bar{D}_{j}\bar{D}_{k}\]

where \(L\) (\(Q\)) are the left-handed lepton (quark) superfields, and \(\bar{E}\), \(\bar{D}\) (\(\bar{U}\)) are the corresponding left-handed antilepton (antiquark) superfields.

These new couplings can lead to \(R_{p}\) violating supersymmetric top decay with a non negligible width, especially if the supersymmetric particles in the decay are lighter than the top quark.

Following a paper of Belyaev _et al._[2], we will concentrate on the cases where the top decays via a \(\lambda^{\prime}\) couplings.

Table 1 gives the present limits on the \(\lambda^{\prime}_{i3k}\) couplings, taken from [3]. Most of the constraints are not too strong, and top decay are interesting for the discovery and measurement of these couplings, or for setting better limits if no signal is observed.

In what follows, the \(\lambda^{\prime}_{233}\) coupling is taken to be the only one different from zero. The top quark can then decay into a neutralino, a muon and a bottom quark, via the diagrams shown on the fig. 1.

Two cases have been looked for: the case where the \(\tilde{b}_{1}\) is lighter than the \(\tilde{\mu}\), \(\tilde{t}\) and even than the top quark, and the case where the three exchanged supersymmetric particles are heavier than the top quark. The first configuration is illustrated by the figure 2 which shows the evolution of the width of the decay \(t\to\tilde{b}_{1}\mu^{+}\) as a function of the \(\mu\) parameter, or as a function of the corresponding \(\tilde{b}_{1}\) mass, for tan \(\beta=\)60 and \(\lambda^{\prime}_{233}\)=0.36. The figure 3 shows the evolution of the width as a function of the Yukawa coupling, for \(M_{\tilde{b}_{1}}\)=156 GeV. In the second configuration, the masses of the sparticles have been chosen to be \(M_{\tilde{b}_{1}}=180\) GeV, \(M_{\tilde{\mu}_{L},R}=202\) and 207 GeV, and \(M_{\tilde{t}_{1}}=208\) GeV. The wid to be too small to be observable, and even smaller than the expected 95% CL limit. For example, the width for \(t\to\chi^{0}\mu b\) is found to be 7*\(10^{-5}\) GeV for \(\lambda^{\prime}_{233}=0.36\). For 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity, the limit at 95% CL on the width is 7.7*\(10^{-5}\) GeV. So, this case will not be considered furthermore in this note. Further studies are needed to achieve a better S/B ratio in the three body case.

## 2 Event generation

In a first step, the supersymmetric parameters have been chosen in such a way that the first sbottom is lighter than the top quark. So, on the 6 diagrams, only the \(\tilde{b_{1}}\) exchange is really contributing to the width of the decay. The parameters are the gluino mass parameter \(M_{3}=420\) GeV, the gaugino mass parameters \(M_{2}=120\) GeV and \(M_{1}=\frac{5}{3}tan^{2}\theta_{W}M_{2}\), the higgsino mass parameter \(\mu\)=-200 GeV, the Higgs vev ratio \(tan\beta\)=60, the sparticle mass parameters \(M_{\tilde{q}}=M_{\tilde{l}}=250\) GeV and the trilinear couplings \(A_{\tau}=A_{b}=A_{t}=0\).

This gives the first sbottom and two neutralinos lighter than the top quark: \(M_{\tilde{b_{1}}}=156\)

Table 1: Limits on the \(\lambda^{\prime}\) couplings. The (ijk) are the generation indice. For the superfield \(Q\), only the third generation is considered. Most of the limits are at \(1\sigma\), excepted those on \(\lambda^{\prime}_{131}\) and \(\lambda^{\prime}_{231}\) which are the \(2\sigma\) limits. In deriving those limits, the sparticle masses are taken to be 100 GeV.

GeV, \(M_{\chi^{0}_{1}}=62\) GeV and \(M_{\chi^{0}_{2}}=110\) GeV. The branching ratio is computed with Comphep[4], and the event generation makes use of Isawig[5] for the signal \(t\bar{t}\to Wb\bar{b}\mu\). 30K events are generated. Pythia[6] is used for the generation of most of the standard model (SM) backgound: \(b\bar{b}\) production, W+jets with \(W\rightarrow\mu\nu\) or \(q_{1}q_{2}\), Z+jets with \(Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\), \(q\bar{q}\) or \(\nu\bar{\nu}\), WW, WZ, ZZ (three samples with all the flavors allowed in the W and Z decays, and two special samples with \(W(Z,W)\rightarrow\mu\nu q\bar{q}\)) and \(t\bar{t}\to WbWb\to j_{1}j_{2}b\mu\nu b\). The \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) production is also taken into account, and generated with the new AcerMC Monte-Carlo[7], the hadronisation part being done by Pythia 6.2. As stated in [7], the cross-section of this process strongly depends on the QCD energy scale \(Q^{2}_{QCD}\). Here, \(Q^{2}_{QCD}=\hat{s}\) is chosen, leading to \(\sigma_{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}=\)4.2 pb. This is the most favorable case, as the cross-section increases by a factor 4 by varying the QCD energy scale. One year of \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) events, with one top decaying to \(\mu\nu b\) and the other one to \(jjb\), is generated.

Supersymmetric backgound is considered. Pair production of spartons, sleptons and gauginos is generated with Isawig[5]. 590K events are generated with the same \(\lambda^{\prime}_{233}\) coupling value as for the signal.

## 3 Event selection

The signal events are \(t\bar{t}\) pairs, where one top decays to \(Wb\), followed by the \(W\to j_{1}j_{2}\) decay, and the second to \(\tilde{b}_{1}\mu\), followed by the \(\tilde{b}_{1}\rightarrow\chi^{0}b\) decay. The \(\chi^{0}\) is either the first or second neutralino, and decays also via the same \(\lambda^{\prime}\) coupling.

The dominant signal signature in Atlas will be an event with two light jets coming from the \(W\) decay, at least four b jets (one for \(t\to Wb\), one for \(\tilde{b}\rightarrow\chi^{0}b\), and at least two in the decay of the neutralino, via the same \(\lambda^{\prime}_{233}\) coupling), a muon and missing energy from the neutralino decay 1. This signature is expected in 93.5% (for \(\lambda^{\prime}_{233}=0.2\)) of the time. The decay \(\tilde{b}\to b\nu\) occurs with a branching ratio of 6.5%, the signature in this case being similar to those of a standard \(t\bar{t}\) decay to \(qqbl\nu b\). This type of decays has not been searched for.

Footnote 1: The case where the \(W\) decays to lepton, neutrino has been considered, searching for a second high \(P_{T}\) lepton in the event instead of the two light jets. The limits are almost the same.

The generated events are processed through the fast simulation package (Atlfast[8]), and the following cuts, chosen to maximize \(S/\sqrt{BKG}\) for \(\lambda^{\prime}_{233}\)=0.2, are applied:

* Due to the high \(\tilde{b}_{1}\) mass, the produced muon has a rather small transverse momentum wrt the SM background (see fig. 4). So, at least one muon with \(6<P_{T}<30\) GeV is required.
* At least 6 jets with \(P_{T}>15\) GeV and \(|\eta|<\)2.5
* There are two b jets which are expected to be energetic, those from the \(t\to Wb\) decay and from the \(\tilde{b}_{1}\) decay (see fig. 4). But there are also two soft b jets, coming from the \(\chi^{0}\) decay. More, the efficiency for b tagging is about 60%, which gives a very small efficiency if one tries to tag the four b jets. So, at least 3 b-tagged jets with \(P_{T}>15\) GeV and \(|\eta|<\)2.5 are required on the previously selected jets.

* At least 2 not b-tagged jets with \(P_{T}>40\) GeV and \(|\eta|<\)2.5 on the previously selected jets.
* \(P_{T}^{miss}>20\) GeV (see fig. 5)

The efficiency is 3.5\(\pm\)0.1% 2 for the signal. The number of expected background events for 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity are indicated in table 2. About 372 signal events/10 fb\({}^{-1}\) are expected.

To evaluate the \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) background, we have substracted to the AcerMC Monte-Carlo prediction (119.7 events/10 fb\({}^{-1}\)) the number of expected \(t\bar{t}(g)\to t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) events from Pythia. On 300K Pythia \(t\bar{t}\rightarrow\mu\nu b\,jjb\), 1153 where found with an ISR or a FSR gluon splitting to \(b\bar{b}\), which corresponds to a total cross-section of \(\sigma_{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}=3.2\) pb. Pythia predicts that 32.9 of these events/10 fb\({}^{-1}\) are selected. Note that there is a big uncertainty on this \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) background, because of the strong \(Q_{QCD}^{2}\) cross-section dependance, but also because of the lack of generated statistics with Pythia: the 2\(\sigma\) limits on the number of expected events is 55.4.

Footnote 2: Trigger efficiency is not simulated, but there are a lot of menus which can select such a signal. For example, \(\mu\)20+2j30 (27%), \(\mu\)10i+j100 (82%), \(\mu\)20+6j15 (27%). The efficiency of the combination of menu \(\mu\)6+3j50 and \(\mu\)10i+j100 is almost 100% [14].

## 4 Results

Using the results obtained with Comphep for the width calculation, the branching ratio for \(t\rightarrow\chi^{0}b\mu\) and for \(t\bar{t}\to Wb\bar{b}\mu\to q_{1}q_{2}b\chi^{0}\mu b\) are those shown on the figure 6. On these figures, the branching ratio of \(\tilde{b}_{1}\to\chi^{0}b\) varies from 78.2% to almost 100% when \(\lambda^{\prime}_{233}\) varies from 0.4 to 0.05.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Background & Cross-section (pb) & Number of events/10 fb\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline \(bb\) & 2.2*10\({}^{6}\) & - \\ W+jets & 36.3*10\({}^{3}\) & 24.2 \\ Z+jets & 13.5*10\({}^{3}\) & - \\ WW,WZ,ZZ & 90.5 & - \\ \(t\bar{t}\) & 833 & 1274.6 \\ \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) & 4.2 & 86.8 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Number of expected background events for one year at low luminosity: \({\cal L}=\)10 fb\({}^{-1}\). The W+jets and \(t\bar{t}\) background is increased by 17% to take into account the \(W\) decay to \(\tau\nu\), followed by \(\tau\to\mu\nu\bar{\nu}\). - means that no events have been selected. The available statistics is few 100k in each case, excepted for the \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) backgound, where only the number of expected events for 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) is generated.

### SM background only

If no excess is observed, 95% C.L. limits on the value of the \(\lambda^{\prime}_{233}\) coupling can be derived. They are shown on the table 3 for one, two and three years at low luminosity, and for \(M_{\tilde{b}_{1}}\) = 156 GeV. Also shown on figure 7 is the exclusion at 95% CL in the \(M_{\tilde{b}_{1}}-\lambda^{\prime}_{233}\) plane, for one, two and three years at low luminosity. An efficiency for the signal of 3.5% is taken for all the points.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \({\cal L}\) (fb\({}^{-1}\)) & \(\sqrt{Background}\) & \(\lambda^{\prime}_{233}\) limit at 95\% C.L. \\ \hline
10 & 37.2 & 0.079 \\
20 & 52.6 & 0.062 \\
30 & 64.5 & 0.054 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Figure 7: Exclusion plot at 95% CL in the \(M_{\tilde{b}_{1}}-\lambda^{\prime}_{233}\) plane, for one, two and three years at low luminosity. An efficiency for the signal of 3.5% is taken for all the points. It is considered that the branching ratio of \(\tilde{b}_{1}\rightarrow\chi^{0}b\) is 100% (this is justified by the small \(\lambda^{\prime}_{233}\) values). Only the SM background is taken into account.

### SM background and supersymmetric background

In this case, to get rid of the supersymmetric background, a Top and a \(W\) mass peak are reconstructed. The two light jets which give an invariant mass closest to the \(W\) mass are paired. The top quark is reconstructed by pairing this \(W\) with the b-tagged jet which gives the maximum tranverse momentum to the top. The reconstructed \(W\) and the reconstructed top must be in a window of \(\pm\) 20 GeV around 80.35 GeV and 175 GeV respectively. The efficiency for the signal decreases to 0.7%, and the number of expected background events, including supersymmetric processes, are those of table 4. The number of expected signal events is 73.7/10 fb\(-\)1 for \(\lambda^{\prime}=0.2\) and \(M_{\tilde{b}_{1}}=156\) GeV. The figure 9 shows the reconstructed Top and W mass distribution for signal (*50) and supersymmetric background.

The coupling values for a discovery at the level of 5 standard deviations are given intable 5 in the case of \(M_{\tilde{b}_{1}}\) = 156 GeV. When the sbottom mass is close to the Top quark mass, the coupling for a 5\(\sigma\) discovery in one year is of the same order as the 1\(\sigma\) limit (0.45). Three years at low luminosity will be necessary for \(M_{\tilde{b}_{1}}\sim M_{Top}\) and \(\lambda^{\prime}_{233}\sim\)0.3. The 5 \(\sigma\) discovery plot in the \(M_{\tilde{b}_{1}}-\lambda^{\prime}_{233}\) plane is given on figure 10. An efficiency for the signal of 0.7% is taken for all the points.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \({\cal L}\) (fb\({}^{-1}\)) & \(\sqrt{Backgd}\) & \(\lambda^{\prime}_{233}\), 5\(\sigma\) discovery \\ \hline
10 & 56.2 & 0.42 \\
20 & 79.5 & 0.36 \\
30 & 97.3 & 0.32 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

An efficiency for the signal of 0.7% is taken for all the points. The supersymmetric background with \(R_{p}\) violated is taken into account. The branching ratio of \(\tilde{b}_{1}\rightarrow\chi^{0}b\) is taken into account, and parametrized as a function of \(\lambda^{\prime}_{233}\).

### Reconstruction of a mass peak?

In this part, we investigate the possibility to reconstruct the sbottom mass peak.

Using the constraint that there are two top quarks in the event, it is possible to calculate the missing \(P_{z}\) due to neutrino(s). The invariant mass constructed with the muon, all the jets but those associated with the first top decay to \(jjb\), and the missing energy must be the top mass. This gives the missing \(P_{z}\) with a quadratic ambiguity. Both solutions are used to evaluate a mass, constructed with the missing energy and the jets. There is no iterative procedure, if a solution is not found, the event is not kept in the mass plot. On the 221/30 fb\(-1\) expected signal events, 156 have a solution. If both solutions are greater than 1.12\(\times M_{Top}\)3, the smaller is kept. If both solutions are positive and smaller than this value, we can see on figure 11 (top plots) that the two solutions are close: the mean is taken as the mass estimator. If only one positive solution is found, this solution is kept. This procedure rejects \(t\bar{t}\) background events where the invariant mass (jets, E missing) does not correspond to any resonance, and also because of the large missing \(P_{T}\) in this background (fig. 9). There are 88 signal events and 40 SM top events expected for 30 fb\(-1\). This analysis applies for sparticle lighter than the top quark: only events with a mass smaller than 200 GeV (roughly 1.12 M\({}_{top}\)) are shown on figure 11 (bottom plot), where only the SM background is shown.

Footnote 3: In the top mass measurement analysis, the same approach gives a reconstructed Top mass with a resolution of 12.4 GeV. Assuming a gaussian distribution, 90% of the top pair events are in the range \(M_{Top}\)\(\pm\)12%.

Unfortunately, 299 supersymmetric background events are also expected for 30 fb\(-1\). This number is evaluated with a very low statistics 4. Then, the shape of the SUSY background is taken to be identical before and after the Top and W mass window cuts. It has been checked that the mass distribution is not strongly dependant of the W mass cut, neither of the Top mass cut. The mass distribution before these cuts is just rescaled to the number of expected events after them. Despite this additional background, it seems feasible to extract the sbottom mass, as shown on figure 12. The resolution depends slighty of the calibration: top plot is obtained with Atlfast jet calibration, and bottom plot with _in-situ_ calibration [10][11] (Only the calibration for the signal is changed, Atlfast calibration is used for background in both cases). A resolution of about 6 GeV is obtained.

Footnote 4: 7 events/590K generated.

With a well known background, it could be possible to use only events with a mass smaller than 200 GeV to discover the signal. In this case, there are only 104 expected background events/10 fb\({}^{-1}\) (14.3 \(t\bar{t}(b\bar{b})\) and 99.6 SUSY events). The signal efficiency is less than 0.3%. Nevertheless, there is an improvement of 33-34% in the 5\(\sigma\) discovery limits. For example, limits of table 5 become 0.28, 0.24 and 0.21. In this case, the mass plot is those of figure 13.

In our case, the \(\tilde{b}\) decays either to \(\chi^{0}_{1}b\) or \(\chi^{0}_{2}b\). Despite this complication, the possibility of reconstructing the neutralino mass peaks has been also considered. After having removed the jets and the muon from the \(t\to Wb\to jjb\) and from the \(t\rightarrow\tilde{b}\mu\) decays in the event, we are left with at least 3 jets, from which at least 2 are b-tagged, plus the missingenergy. These objects can be used to search for the neutralinos. Distributions which have been considered are:

* The most energetic remaining jet is supposed to be the b jet coming from the \(\tilde{b}\) decay. The invariant mass of all the other jets plus the missing energy does not give clear neutralino peaks.
* The most energetic remaining b-jet is supposed to be the b jet coming from the \(\tilde{b}\) decay. The invariant mass of all the other jets plus the missing energy does not give clear neutralino peaks.
* The two jets with smallest \(P_{T}\) are associated with the missing energy. No \(\chi^{0}_{1}\) mass peak can be established.
* The two jets closest to the missing \(P_{T}\) (in \(\Delta R\)) are associated with the missing energy. No \(\chi^{0}_{1}\) mass peak can be established.

These distributions have been studied for both solutions for missing \(P_{z}\). Even using the

Figure 11: Top: the two masses obtained for the two missing \(P_{z}\) solutions for the signal. Bottom: mass peak obtained for a generated mass of \(M_{\tilde{b}_{1}}\)=156 GeV. Only the SM background is shown (grey area).

\(M_{\tilde{b}}\) mass peak to make the best \(P_{z}\) choice (i.e. those which gives the closest solution to the peak) and keeping only events in \(\pm 2\sigma\) or \(\pm 1\sigma\) arround the \(M_{\tilde{b}}\) mass peak does not help. Figure 14 shows the mass distribution obtained with the first method in a \(\pm 2\sigma\) window around the \(M_{\tilde{b}}\) mass peak 5. Top plot is for signal only, bottom plot is for signal and supersymmetric background. It is not possible to find the neutralino mass peak in such a channel.

Footnote 5: The signal distribution (top plot) shows a \(\chi^{0}_{2}\) peak at \(\sim 110\) GeV, but not the \(\chi^{0}_{1}\) peak at \(\sim 62\) GeV. This tell us that selected events are preferently those with \(\tilde{b}_{1}\to\chi^{0}_{2}b\) decay. In this case, the b-jets from \(\chi^{0}\) are more energetic than for \(\tilde{b}_{1}\to\chi^{0}_{1}b\) decay.

### Other coupling: \(\lambda^{\prime}_{333}\)

With the same selection, one has also access to the top decay via a \(\lambda^{\prime}_{333}\) coupling. The signal is the same, the muon being replaced by a tau. The efficiencies for selecting events

Figure 12: Mass distribution obtained for a generated mass of \(M_{\tilde{b}_{1}}\)=156 GeV for the signal. SM and SUSY background are considered. The signal has been increased by the ratio \((\frac{0.32}{0.2})^{2}=2.56\), to correspond to the minimal number of expected events in case of a \(5\sigma\) discovery. Note that part of the background will certainly scale also with the coupling: this is not taken into account.

with a \(\tau\to e\nu\bar{\nu}\) decay and for selecting events with a \(\tau\rightarrow\mu\nu\bar{\nu}\) decay are assumed to be equal. This gives an efficiency of about 1.1% for the signal (for \(\lambda^{\prime}_{333}=0.2\) and \(t\rightarrow\tau\bar{b}_{1}\) decay). The SM background is taken 2 times larger than in the previous case.

The 95% C.L. limits are then 0.18, 0.15 and 0.14 for 10, 20 and 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) integrated luminosity respectively. Of course, these limits can be improve if the \(\tilde{\tau}\) is the NLSP. This case is studied in the context of Tevatron and Lhc in [12].

## 5 GMSB case

The case where supersymmetry breaking is transmitted through gauge interactions is an another possibility. Four sets of GMSB parameters have been studied in the previous Atlas publications [1][9]. Only one is considered here, called point G1a. The parameters are the SUSY breaking mass scale \(\Lambda=\)90 TeV, the messenger mass \(M_{m}\)=500 TeV, the number of equivalent 5+\(\bar{5}\) fields \(N_{5}=\)1, the Higgs vev ratio \(tan\beta\)=5, the sign of the \(\mu\) term

Figure 13: Mass distribution obtained for a generated mass of \(M_{\tilde{b}_{1}}\)=156 GeV for the signal. SM and SUSY background are considered. Both signal and background are for \(\lambda^{\prime}_{233}=0.2\) and 30 fb\({}^{-1}\).

sgn \(\mu\)=+1 and the scale factor for the gravitino mass \(C_{grav}=\)1. In this case, the next lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) is the \(\chi^{0}_{1}\), and it decays in the detector because of its short lifetime \(c\tau\) = 1.2mm. In the other cases, either the NLSP is not the \(\chi^{0}_{1}\) but the \(\tilde{\tau}\), or the \(\chi^{0}\) has a very long lifetime \(c\tau\) = 1 km.

With the chosen set of parameters, this is the \(\tilde{\mu}_{R}\) which is lighter than the \(\tilde{b}_{1}\): \(M_{\tilde{\mu}_{R}}\)=164 GeV. The dominant diagram is now the \(\tilde{\mu}_{R}b\) decay. This also explains the figures 4, where the role of the \(\mu\) and of the bottom quark are 'exchanged' between the MSSM \(R_{p}\) violated case and the GMSB case.

Isajet has been used to produce \(t\bar{t}\) events, where one top decays to \(\tilde{\mu}_{R}b\) and the second one to \(Wb\). There is no other \(R_{p}\) violating decays. The dominant \(\chi^{0}\) decay is \(\chi^{0}\rightarrow\tilde{G}\gamma\), the \(\chi^{0}\to b\bar{b}\nu\) decay is not allowed in the event generation. The signal which is searched for is now 2 light jets, 2 b-tagged jets, a muon, some missing energy and an isolated and energetic photon. The distributions of the photon energy and photon tranverse momentum are shown on the figure 15.

The selection follows those used in the top mass measurement in the lepton plus jets channel [13]. At least a muon of \(P_{T}>\) 20 GeV, a missing \(P_{T}>\) 20 GeV, 4 jets with \(P_{T}>\) 40 GeV and \(|\eta|<\) 2.5, of which 2 are tagged as b-jets are required. A photon of more than

Top plot is for the signal alone, when an invariant mass is done with all the jets but the most energetic associated to \(\tilde{b}\) decay, and the missing energy. Bottom plot is the same, but with supersymmetric background. The grey area is signal, and the histogram is the sum of signal and supersymmetric background.

10 GeV is also searched for. The selection efficiency is 1%. The number of background events for one year at low luminosity is indicated in table 6. The figure 16 shows the 95% CL exclusion in the \(M_{\tilde{\mu}_{R}}\)-\(\lambda^{\prime}_{233}\) plane, assuming that the variation of the width for \(t\rightarrow\tilde{\mu}_{R}b\) with the \(\tilde{\mu}_{R}\) mass is the same than the variation of the \(t\rightarrow\tilde{b}_{1}\mu\) decay width with the \(\tilde{b}_{1}\) mass, and also that the branching ratio of \(\tilde{\mu}_{R}\rightarrow\chi^{0}\mu\) is 100%, as well as the branching ratio of \(\chi^{0}\rightarrow\gamma\tilde{G}\).

## 6 Conclusion

The possibility of a top decay via a \(\lambda^{\prime}\) Yukawa coupling has been discussed. The easier case, with a muon and four b-jets in the final state has been fully studied.

* These type of decays are interesting in the two body decay case. The three body decays are found to be too small to be observable, and their branching ratio are below the expected 95% CL limit.
* If no excess is observed, a large improvement can be obtain on the present limits on the \(\lambda^{\prime}_{233}\) and \(\lambda^{\prime}_{333}\) couplings, both in the MSSM and GMSB model.
* To unanbigously attribute an excess to a \(R_{p}\) broken supersymmetric decay of the top quark, the coupling must not be too small, of the order of 0.3 for a mass of the sparticle of 150 GeV, for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Figure 16: Exclusion plot at 95% CL in the \(M_{\tilde{\mu}_{R}}-\lambda^{\prime}_{233}\) plane, for one, two and three years at low luminosity. An efficiency for the signal of 1% is taken for all the points. Only standard model background is taken into account. It is considered that the branching ratio of \(\tilde{\mu}_{R}\to\chi^{0}\mu\) follows the same parametrization than the BR(\(\tilde{b}_{1}\to b\chi^{0}\)), as a function of \(\lambda^{\prime}_{233}\). The branching ratio of \(\chi^{0}\to\gamma\tilde{G}\) is taken to 100%.

* Despite the large SUSY \(R_{p}\) broken background, it seems feasible to reconstruct the sbottom mass peak in this channel. These latter conclusion depends strongly of how the background will be known, both for the SM background (there is a 12% uncertainty on \(\sigma_{t\bar{t}}\), and a factor 4 uncertainty on \(\sigma_{t\bar{b}b\bar{b}}\)) and for the supersymmetric one. If the mass reconstruction is used as a discriminant variable, a coupling of the order of 0.2 for a mass of the sparticle of 150 GeV is sufficient to discover this signal, for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). It is also found that given the huge supersymmetric background, it is not possible to reconstruct the neutralino mass peak.

Other couplings lead to final states which need different analysis to be studied. In the MSSM, the final state contains two same sign leptons for \(\lambda^{\prime}_{132}\), \(\lambda^{\prime}_{232}\) (relevant if the \(\tilde{e}\) or \(\tilde{\mu}\) are light enough), \(\lambda^{\prime}_{331}\) and \(\lambda^{\prime}_{332}\) (relevant if the \(\tilde{\tau}\) is light), four light jets and two b jets.
