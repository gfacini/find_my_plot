This note is a summary of the results of PMT testing at the University of Illinois. A total of 20 3\({}^{rd}\) generation Hamamatsu R-5900 photomultiplier tubes have been tested. Measurements of PMT dark current, photocathode sensitivity and gain have been carried out, using DC light, and PMT gain with pulsed LED light, using a blue LED. The test setups used to carry out these measurements are described, and the PMT measurements are discussed in detail.

PMT Test Setup(s) at UI

The dark box we used for making PMT measurements at UI is shown below in Fig. 1. An aluminum base plate held three main components - the LED light source assembly, the PMT holder assembly and a photodiode holder assembly. The LED light source assembly consisted of two machined aluminum blocks, the smaller of which held the LED, which was a narrow beam, water-clear blue LED [5], which peaked in the \(\lambda=450\) nm region. Immediately downstream of the aluminum block holding the LED was a 1/4" gap, used for inserting a 1" diameter neutral density filter, of arbitrary optical density. Immediately downstream of this was a larger aluminnum block, which held a 2" diameter interference filter, the pass-band of which was centered at \(\lambda=480\)nm with a FWHM of 10 nm. Downstream of the interference filter was a "standard" ATLAS TileCal PMT optical mixer (dimensions: 18 mm x 18 mm x 42 mm) followed by two 30 cm long 1.5 mm diameter multiclad plastic optical fibers, which transported equal amounts of light from the blue LED to the Hamamatsu R-5900 undergoing testing and also to a photodiode LED intensity monitor.

At the aluminum PMT holder assembly, the light exiting the PMT optical fiber was input to another standard ATLAS TileCal PMT optical mixer. The photocathode of the Hamamatsu R-5900 PMT was immediately downstream of the optical mixer. This PMT holder assembly had a cylindrical bore for holding one ATLAS TileCal PMT block. This PMT block actually held the PMT, the optical mixer and the PMT base HV divider circuit board (provided by ATLAS TileCal personnel from Clermont-Ferrand).

Similarly, the aluminum photodiode holder assembly contained a third standard ATLAS TileCal PMT optical mixer, and then the photodiode monitor. For DC light tests, a Hamamatsu S1337-1010BQ silicon photodiode (active area of 10 mm x 10 mm) was used, the output of which was buffered by one channel of a TL084 FET Op-Amp IC with a modest amount of gain. For pulsed LED light PMT testing, an EG&G FND-100 fast PIN photodiode was used, which had low noise and an active area of 5.1 mm\({}^{2}\). The output from the FND-100 PIN photodiode was amplified using two TL084 Op-Amps in series.

During PMT testing, the ambient temperatures of the LED, the PMT undergoing tests and the photodiode were continuously monitored using calibrated AD-590J temperature sensors located in proximity to each of these devices, and read out via high-gain, low-noise analog circuitry that enabled us to easily detect changes in temperature as small as 0.01 \({}^{\circ}\)C. In addition, a mercury centigrade thermometer was also kept in the dark box, mounted in thermal contact with the aluminum base plate of the PMT test fixture. Its temperature was recorded in the logbook at the beginning and end of each PMT test procedure. In no instance did any of the temperatures monitored ever change by more than 0.1 \({}^{\circ}\)C during any of the times a PMT was undergoing test measurements.

The setup we used for PMT dark current measurements and DC light measurements is shown in Fig. 2. A Dell PC was interfaced to CAMAC using a DSP-6002 CAMAC interface and CAMAC Controller, which was used to talk to a LeCroy HV-4032 mainframe, supplying -HV for PMT anode and dark current measurements. A 12-bit DAC on a National Instruments Lab PC+ card was used to control a Droege + HV power supply for PMT photocathode sensitivity measurements, and read out, via 12-bit ADC's on the Lab PC+ card, the analog signal(s) from a Keithly Model 480 pAmmeter, the analog signal from the Hamamatsu S1337-1010BQ photodiode, and the analog signals from each of the three AD590J temperature sensors in the PMT dark box. The DAQ program was written using LabWindows/CVI software.

The setup we used for pulsed light measurements is shown in Fig. 3. The basic setup is quite similar to that of the DC light setup, but here we used a LeCroy 2249A ADC (250 fC least count) to record the signals from the PMT under test, the signal from the FND-100 PIN photodiode monitor, and 10% of the signal directly from the LED pulser. TTL signals from the Lab PC+ card were used to trigger a fast LED pulser circuit, or take ADC pedestal runs. One of the Lab PC+ DAC's was used to set the DC voltage for the LED pulser circuit, to control the LED light intensity.

PMT Dark Adaption and Temperature Stabilization

Before the response characteristics of any of the PMTs were measured, we allowed a period of time to elapse after installing the PMT in the PMT test fixture in the dark box in order to enable the PMT to come into thermal equilibrium and also to come into electrostatic equilibrium. While the process of transferring PMT's from their darkened storage location to the dark box for testing in our lab was carried out in low light-level conditions, some amount of light was necessary in order for us to see what we were doing. Because of this, the PMT was exposed to the ambient low-level room light. In the transfer process, merely holding the PMT block assembly during the short time needed to install it in the PMT test fixture was sufficient to raise its temperature by a few degrees, as observed by monitoring the AD590J PMT temperature sensor. PMT testing did not commence until at least thermal equilibrium was achived.

Even after allowing a period of time to elapse for the PMT to come into thermal equilibrium, we found empirically that if PMT testing was carried out without first "exercising" the PMT by slowly ramping up the HV _and_ simultaneously illuminating it with light from the LED, that the measured PMT response(s) often were not stable and/or reproducible. We found that PMT "burn in" was necessary to eliminate these observed initial electrostatic instabilities in the PMT undergoing testing. Even with no HV applied and/or connected, PMT's exposed to light can give off substantial numbers of photoelectrons from the photocathode, which in turn go everywhere on the internal structure of the PMT - the dynodes as well as the glass inside the PMT, which can result in a static charge buildup that can adversely, temporarily affect the performance of the PMT. By first applying high voltage _and_ light to the PMT before serious data taking, the static charge buildup is cleared out. We call this step PMT "burn in". We originally started using this PMT "burn in" technique with only the PMT base divider in order to remove trace moisture buildup on the base, because early on we observed a similar effect due to PMT base surface leakage currents (see discussion below on PMT Dark Current Measurements), but then started carrying out PMT "burn-in" procedures for the DC light and pulsed light PMT measurements as well. By using these PMT "burn in" techniques prior to PMT performance testing, we were able to obtain extremely stable and reproducible results. The validity of using these "burn in" methods were also explicitly tested by deliberately allowing several of the PMT's under testing to dark adapt in the so-called "traditional" manner, allowing the PMT to remain undisturbed in the dark box after nominal testing, for periods from 12 to 24 hours, and then repeating the tests without change in the previously obtained results.

## 4 PMT Dark Current Measurements

During our first, initial attempts at measuring the R-5900 PMT dark currents, we used the "standard" 2.5:2.5:1.0...1.0:2.5:2.5 PMT base dividers precisely as supplied to us directly from personnel at Clermont-Ferrand. The analog output from the Keithley Model 480 pAmmeter, read out via the PC through an ADC channel on the Lab PC+ card, was used for obtaining these measurements. Typically 1000 individual ADC reads were taken for a single such dark current measurement, the mean (and sigma) computed, and used as "the" dark current measurement.

Handling of the PMT's and PMT base dividers was always carried out using brand-new latex surgical gloves. However, despite our handling precautions, we were alarmed at finding several R-5900 PMT + PMT base dividers which had considerable "dark currents", in the \(\sim 10\) nA range, which also seemed to drop significantly (and rather rapidly) with time as the PMT HV was left on. We also noticed that the solder rosin/flux from soldering in the surface-mount components on the PMT base dividers was still there, and given that at the time of testing these PMT's, it was extremely humid here, from previous experience with solving similar "dark current" problems, we suspected that the large "dark currents" we were observing were likely due to humidity-aggravated surface leakage currents on the PMT base divider boards, and decided to try cleaning off each of the PMT base dividers, using ultra-pure isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath, after first explicitly checking that doing so would not harm the components on the PMT base dividers in any way. This cleaning procedure was extremely successful, dramatically reducing both the magnitude and time-dependence of the overall "dark current". We explicitly verified that this was the case by measuring the "dark current" associated with (only) the PMT base divider as a function of HV (before and after cleaning), and then repeating the dark current measurement with PMT + PMT base divider as a function of HV. With a clean PMT base divider, the "dark current" due to surface leakage currents was often \(<<\) than the true PMT anode dark current, which is obtained by subtracting the observed PMT base-only dark current, for a given HV, from the PMT + PMT base dark current, for the same HV, \(i.e.\)\(I_{PMT\ only}=I_{PMT\ base}-I_{PMT\ base}\). These measurements were always taken after an initial PMT "burn in" period, where the PMT HV was slowly ramped from 0 V to -820 V and held there for \(\sim 1\) minute. The PMT \(etc.\) temperatures were also monitored during this time.

The before cleaning vs. after cleaning difference in PMT base only, PMT + PMT base, and PMT only "dark current" as a function of HV for five of the 20 total Hamamatsu R-5900 PMT's tested is shown in Fig 4 (the results for the other 15 R-5900 PMT's that are not shown are very similar to these).

After cleaning the PMT base dividers, a comparison of PMT + PMT base vs. PMT base only "dark current", as a function of HV for all 20 of the Hamamatsu R-5900 PMT's tested is shown in Fig. 5.

After cleaning the PMT base dividers, the true PMT (only) anode dark current, as a function of HV for all 20 of the Hamamatsu R-5900 PMT's tested is shown in Fig. 6.

The dark current data is summarized in Table 2 below, and is quoted for a measured nominal gain of \(10^{5}\). The PMT base leakage current is the current for just the PMT base alone. The dark current is for the base and PMT combined, while the net PMT current is the true PMT anode dark current, equal to the measured PMT + PMT base dark current minus the PMT base leakage current. Note that PMT Base number 27 is highlighted since it was used with more than one tube (There were only fifteen bases but twenty tubes).

While the average true PMT anode dark current at nominal PMT gain was 27.67 pA, the maximum true PMT anode dark current at nominal PMT gain was 124.696 pA. We also tried cleaning the PMT base dividers with significantly higher leakage current (e.g. Base # 17) several times, without any apparent improvement. Nothing anomalous and/or noticably different was visible with these PMT base dividers - these PMT base dividers could have had additional bulk leakage currents, \(e.g.\) in the G-10 material, between electrical contacts.

that had been filtered by a interferential bandpass filter (Andover \(480\pm 5\) nm; FWHM: 10 nm) and then passed into a light mixer. The photocathode of the R-5900 series PMT is a type of bialkaki (\(Sb-K^{2}-Cs\)), with a maximum spectral response at 420 nm. The PMT base divider used the "standard" HV partition of 2.5:2.5:1.0:1.0...1.0:1.0:2.5:2.5 for ten dynodes.

Two different sets of DC light photocathode sensitivity measurements were carried out. One set was done when the light intensity such that the R-5900 photocathode current, after reaching its plateau value, was measured to be \(\sim 10\) nA. The other set wasobtained with the light intensity such that \(\sim 30\) nA was obtained from the R-5900 photocathode. These measurements were to test the quality of the R-5900 photocathode. They were measured by setting up a positive voltage difference between the photocathode and the first dynode (all other dynodes were shorted out to the first dynode). The photocathode current was measured directly using the Keithley Model 480 pAmmeter (read out via its analog output to an ADC channel on the National Instruments Lab PC+ card), + HV was applied to the first dynode using a PC-controlled Lab PC+ DAC to in turn control the Droege + HV power supply, over the voltage range of 0-140 V.

The two different sets of DC light photocathode sensitivity measurements for the 20 Hamamatsu R-5900 PMT's are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 for the 10 nA and 30 nA "low" and "high" light level responses, respectively. Fig. 9 shows a scatterplot of the ratio of photocathode currents (normalized to our "reference PMT", tube # 13 of our batch, 6A 23C3):

\[(I_{pk}(10\ {\rm nA})/I_{pk}^{6A23C3}(10\ {\rm nA}))/(I_{pk}(30\ {\rm nA})/I_{pk}^{6A23C3}(30\ {\rm nA}))\]

at the nominal PMT gain, \({\rm G}\ =\ 10^{5}\) for each PMT, and a plot of the average of this normalized ratio,

\[(I_{pk}(10\ {\rm nA})/I_{pk}^{6A23C3}(10\ {\rm nA})\ +\ I_{pk}(30\ {\rm nA})/I_{pk}^{6A23C3}(30\ {\rm nA}))/2\]

for each of the twenty Hamamatsu R-5900 PMT's we measured, in sequence by tube #. The a few (but not all) of the "high-resistivity" photocathode R-5900 PMT's are noticably shifted away from the central value of 1.0 on each of these two plots - these PMT's are denoted by a light blue star on each of these two plots.

The Hamamatsu R-5900 PMT photocathode sensitivities typically plateaued at between 15-30 Volts; however, six of the twenty Hamamatsu R-5900 PMT's were found to plateau around 100 Volts at a light level of 30 nA. This leads to a problem when minimum operating voltages are computed. It also leads one to suspect that Hamamatsu made a bad batch of PMT's, and these six tubes were part of that batch.

In order to find out if there are going to be any problems with minimum operating voltages, the voltage between the photocathode and the first dynode (\(V_{pk}\)) needs to be determined as a percentage of the total high voltage applied to the PMT (\(V_{a}\)). This percentage is given by the ratio of the resistor between the photocathode and the first dynode to the total resistance of the entire PMT.

\[\frac{V_{pk}}{V_{A}}\ =\ \frac{R_{pk\to 1st}}{R_{tot}}\ =\ \frac{2.5}{1 6}\ =\ 0.1\,5625. \tag{2}\]

The minimum voltage for \(V_{A}\) times the ratio above should be greater than the \(V_{pk}\) needed to ensure total collection of photoelectrons at any light level. This means that \(V_{A}\) times the ratio should be greater than the \(V_{pk}\) at which the photocathode sensitivity plateaus. It should be \(V_{A}*Ratio>V_{pk\to plateau}\).

The average \(V_{A}=\,670\,\)Volts.

\[V_{A}*Ratio\ =\ (760Volts)*(0.15625)\ =\ 104.69Volts>V_{pk\to plateau}. \tag{3}\]

Unfortunately, the 6 bad tubes reach the knee for photocathode sensitivity at around 100 Volts. This means that these tubes would not necessarily collect all the photoelectrons at all light levels that would be expected. That will lead to systematic inaccuracies in the data obtained from these tubes.

\[V_{A}*Ratio\ =\ 104.69Volts\approx\ V_{pk\to bathbes}\approx 100Volts. \tag{4}\]

This is bad. These tubes can be said to have a highly resistive photocathode. We recommend that these tubes be rejected, and not used for ATLAS TileCal Module 0.

## 6 Measurement of PMT Gain - DC Light Mode

The PMT Gain is defined as the relative amount of increase from the input signal to the output signal. The input signal is the flux of photoelectrons produced from the photocathode by incoming light flux (photons). For DC light measurements, this input signal is called \(I_{p^{k}}\). These photoelectrons travel to the first dynode, where they are multiplied, and are then multiplied again by their net transit down the dynode chain, until reaching the last dynode, known as the anode of the PMT. For DC light measurements, the output signal from the PMT anode is again a current: \(I_{A}\). Therefore, the PMT gain is defined as:\[G(H\,V)\ =\ \frac{I_{A}(\,HV)}{I_{pk}(\,H\,V)} \tag{5}\]

Unfortunately, eq. 5 can not be directly used in the present setup since the \(I_{pk}\) would be far too small to be accurately measured, for a physically measureable \(I_{A}\) (or vice versa). The average PMT gain in the working range of the PMT is of order \(10^{5}\). This means that the \(I_{pk}\) is five orders of magnitude smaller than the \(I_{A}\) for DC light. The experimental setup did not include any instruments that could accurately measure that great of a range of currents, so a way had to be devised to put both currents in about the same range. The input light flux was decreased for the anode measurements, using a neutral density filter (NDF) to cut out about 99% of the input light flux during the PMT anode current measurements.

Actually, there were a number of different ways we considered for decreasing the input light flux. One was that the voltage to the light source (the LED) could be reduced a corresponding amount; however, the I-V curve of the LED is not necessarily linear over its range. Since the light output from the LED is directly proportional to the current in the LED, this means that for any decrease in the voltage to the LED, the current (and the light output) cannot be guaranteed to go down a correspondingly linear amount. While we could have in principle used the photodiode monitor to independently give us this information, we did not want to rely on using such a technique, because it is known that the LED's I-V relation is exponentially non-linear in the turn-on region, and any small deviations and/or shifts \(e.g.\) in potential applied to the LED in the low-light level turn-on regime of the I-V curve of the LED are exponentially magnified in their error. Hence we chose not to pursue this possibility further.

A second, more controlled and reproducible way of reducing the light flux during the PMT anode current measurements is to filter out a fraction of the total amount of light from the LED using a neutral density filter, leaving the light intensity from the LED unchanged. Here again, while there is no first-principles way of assuring one's self that the light transmitted through the neutral density filter is actually reduced by precisely the amount needed, the uncertainty in this latter method can be greatly reduced by measuring the relative reduction in the net amount of light from the LED - with the neutral density filter in place vs. removed, via comparison of the resulting signals from the photodiode monitor, as well as (and independently) via comparison of the resulting signals from the PMT anode current measurements, with and without the neutral density filter.

This method of reducing the input light flux via use of a neutral density filter (NDF) introduces however, another variable into the PMT gain equation:

\[G(H\,V)\ =\ \frac{I_{A}(\,HV)}{I_{pk}(\,H\,V)\times T_{NDF}} \tag{6}\]

Where \(I_{pk}\) is measured without the NDF installed, \(I_{A}\) is measured with the NDF installed, and \(T_{NDF}\) is the fractional transmission of the neutral density filter such that:

\[T_{NDF}\ =\ \frac{Flux_{Transmitted}}{Flux_{In\,d\,ent}} \tag{7}\]So, \(I_{A}\) is reduced by a certain amount by the neutral density filter; thus, in order to find the strength of the unfiltered \(I_{A}\), the filtered \(I_{A}\) is multiplied by the optical density of the filter. This gives:

\[G(\mathit{HV})\ =\ \frac{(I_{A}(\mathit{HV}))_{unfit\_pred}}{I_{pk}(\mathit{HV})}= \frac{(I_{A}(\mathit{HV}))_{fi\_pred}}{I_{pk}(\mathit{HV})\times T_{NDF}} \tag{8}\]

Operationally, then, three things need to be measured: \(T_{NDF}\), \(I_{A}(\mathit{HV})\), and \(I_{pk}(\mathit{HV})\). The PMT photocathode current, \(I_{pk}\) as a function of photocathode-first dynode potential difference was measured without the NDF installed. This was carried out again by allowing the PMT to first come into thermal equilibrium, and then ramping the Droege + HV slowly from 0-140 V for "burn-in" with the LED light turned on at its nominal operating level, before taking any data. The + HV was then brought back to 0 V under PC control, and then measurements of the \(I_{pk}\) vs. + HV began. After these measurements were completed, the + HV was turned off, and the NDF was then manually inserted in the DC light test setup, without disturbing the rest of the setup in any way, other than to simply insert the NDF in its fixture, just downstream of the LED.

At the same time that \(I_{pk}\) was measured using the Keithley Model 480 pAmmeter, the Hamamatsu S1337-1010BQ photodiode's voltage response was also measured (along with all AD590J temperature sensors). LED-off measurements were also made during the \(I_{pk}\) vs. + HV measurement(s), to remove photocathode dark current from the \(I_{pk}\) measurement (essentially negligible) and to remove the photodiode voltage pedestal.

The optical density 2.0 NDF used reduced the input light level by 99%, but this was well within the range of the Keithley Model 480 pAmmeter. Immediately after the NDF was inserted, the PMT photocathode current, \(I_{pk}\) was again measured with the LED on and the + HV held at +120 V. The voltage output from the photodiode was also measured. The LED was then turned off, and pedestal measurements made for both the PMT photocathode current and photodiode, with the NDF installed. The + HV was then ramped to 0 V. These measurements of the PMT photocathode current and photodiode output voltages (pedestal subtracted) comparing results with _vs._ without the NDF installed, enabled us two independent in-situ methods of determining on-line, the value of \(T_{NDF}\) for the neutral density filter. In general, these two methods of determining \(T_{NDF}\) agreed quite well with each other, however see additional discussions of this point in the paragraph following the next one.

A big, multi-element HV ceramic rotary switch mounted on the end of the PMT dark box was then used to manually switch over to PMT anode current measurement (a special PMT base divider was used for this, electronically identical to the "standard" ATLAS TileCal PMT base divider). Since we always used the same PMT base for the DC light PMT gain measurements, we also needed to explicitly calibrate + HV from the Droege vs. -HV from the LeCroy, obtained from direct measurements with a high-input impedance Hewlett-Packard DMM with and without use of a calibrated HV probe, for redundancy. These results agreed extremely well with each other, such that specific LeCroy - HV values were chosen to exactly coincide with/map on to Droege + HV values, thus facilitating ease of the data analysis, offline (actually, the necessary calibration constants were included in the online DAQ code, so we were in fact able to compute the PMT gain on-line). The PC ramped up the -HV for the anode current measurements and turned on the LED. After one complete "burn-in" cycle, the PMT anode current measurements were then taken, along with the photodiode voltage response at each -HV point. Again, LED-off measurements were also made during the \(I_{A}\) vs. -HV measurements, to remove anode dark current from the \(I_{A}\) measurement and the photodiode voltage pedestal (empirically found to be the same as for the PMT photocathode current measurement, and LED-on measurements of the photodiode output during the PMT anode current measurements were also found to be in excellent agreement with LED-on measurements of the photodiode output during the PMT photocathode current measurements, with the NDF installed).

Initially, early on in the development of the PMT test setup at UI, four different stand-alone tests were done to determine the \(T_{NDF}\) for the optical density 2.0 neutral density filter we used in our PMT testing facility. Two tests were done using a Hamamatsu R-5900 PMT in photocathode mode at a set + HV (well above the knee of its plateau, at 120 V), and two other tests were done with the photodiode. All four tests involved comparing the light level with and without the filter. In the first PMT test, the photocathode current was measured by the Keithley pAmmeter and the readings were recorded by hand. For the second PMT test, the photocathode current was again measured by the pAmmeter; however, the signal from the analog out on the pAmmeter went to an ADC channel on the Lab PC+ card. The results from the two methods of determining \(T_{NDF}\) from the PMT photocathode measurements agreed extremely well with each other, with \(T_{NDF}~{}=~{}1.155\pm~{}0.064\%\)

The next two stand-alone tests used the photodiode only. The photodiode signal was measured simultaneously with the first and second PMT photocathode current measurements as described above. The first photodiode measurements were also done by hand (simultaneously with the hand-done PMT photocathode current measurements), using a Hewlett-Packard DMM, measuring LED light-on vs. LED light-off photodiode voltages, with and without the NDF installed. The second set of photodiode voltage measurements were carried out using the PC to read out the photodiode voltages via an ADC channel on the Lab PC+ card, again simultaneously with measurements of the PC-read out analog voltages from the PMT photocathode measurements output from the Keithley Model 480 pAmmeter. The results of the two methods of determining \(T_{NDF}\) from the photodiode measurements agreed extremely well with each other, with \(T_{NDF}~{}=~{}1.187\pm~{}0.025\%\), which is a difference of \(0.032\pm~{}0.069\%\) compared to the PMT photocathode method of determining \(T_{NDF}\), this difference corresponds to a fractional \(T_{NDF}\) difference between measurement methods of 2.9 \(\pm~{}6.4\%\), which, while being statistically consistent with no significant difference in measurement of \(T_{NDF}\), we observed that this difference was systematically always skewed (as above), throughout the entire 20 R-5900 PMT measurement process. We were unable to pinpoint the origin of this small discrepancy, despite making significant efforts on our part to isolate its source, such as investigating the linearity and dynamic range of the Keithley Model 480 pAmmeter, especially when current scales were changed. We were not successful in discovering any physical source for this observed discrepancy.

This small discrepancy in the determination of \(T_{NDF}\) lead us to the question of which measurement of \(T_{NDF}\) was the most accurate - the PMT photocathode current method or the photodiode method? It was reasoned that if the PMT photocathode measurement was wrong, a possible explanation was that it could be due to the effect(s) of space charge. The space charge would have a stronger effect at higher light levels and therefore reduce the signal. This would make the denominator of equation 7 smaller, which in turn would make the \(T_{NDF}\) larger, which was exactly the opposite of the observed effect - the PMT measurement of \(T_{NDF}\) is smaller than that measured usingthe photodiode. On the other hand, if the \(T_{NDF}\) measured using the photodiode was wrong, TL084 amplifier non-linearity could successfully explain the observed effects, even though the output of the TL084 was nowhere near saturating its output. This reasoning then lead us to (preferentially) conclude that the \(T_{NDF}\) as measured by the PMT photocathode method was the more accurate method of determining the \(T_{NDF}\). However, the photodiode data was dutifully recorded, and \(T_{NDF}\) from the photodiode data computed on-line throughout the entire PMT measuring process, to be compared with the \(T_{NDF}\) as determined from the PMT photocathode method.

Thus, our conclusion was that the most reliable way of computing the \(T_{NDF}\) was:

\[T_{NDF}\ =\ \frac{I_{p^{\,\mathrm{t}}k}^{\,\mathrm{n\,\mathrm{t}}\,t}\, \rightarrow\,\,w/\,\,N\,DF}{I_{p^{\,\mathrm{t}}k}^{\,\mathrm{n\,\mathrm{t}}\, t}\,\rightarrow\,\,w/\,o\,\,N\,DF} \tag{9}\]

The PMT gain for a given HV was then computed from the the measured net anode current, the measured net photocathode current and the PMT photocathode current measured \(T_{NDF}\):

\[G(\mathit{HV})\ =\ \frac{I_{an}^{\,\mathrm{n\,\mathrm{t}}\,t}(\mathit{HV})}{I_{ pk}^{\,\mathrm{n\,\mathrm{t}}\,t}(\mathit{HV})*T_{NDF}}=\frac{I_{an}^{LED}( \mathit{HV})-I_{an}^{DRK}(\mathit{HV})}{I_{pk}^{LED}(\mathit{HV})-I_{pk}^{DRK}( \mathit{HV})}*\frac{1}{T_{NDF}} \tag{10}\]

Despite the fact that we used the same NDF throughout the entire PMT testing process, we in fact did notice some time-dependence of \(T_{NDF}\) during this period (the NDF was never touched by human hands in any way), again at a small fraction of 1% effect. What was an uncontrolled (but recorded) variable during this period of time was the ambient humidity. It appears that the changes we observed in \(T_{NDF}\) were anticorrelated with the humidity - \(i.e.\) an increase(decrease) in humidity resulted in a decrease (increase) in the measured \(T_{NDF}\). The two independent methods we used for measuring/monitoring \(T_{NDF}\) seemed to track each other with time, leading us to believe that the observed time-dependence and anti-correlation with humidity was a real effect, and hence we used the insitu-measured \(T_{NDF}\) for each PMT tested in the PMT gain calculation(s), rather than a single, constant value for \(T_{NDF}\) (independent of time/ambient humidity).

The PMT gains for DC light as a function of HV for the 20 Hamamatsu R-5900 PMT's are shown in Fig. 10 for "low" light levels at \(I_{pk}\ \sim\ 10\) nA (plateau value) and in Fig. 11 for "high" light levels at \(I_{pk}\ \sim\ 30\) nA (plateau value).

Measurement of PMT Gain - Pulsed LED Mode

The PMT gain of all the PMTs was also measured using the LED in pulsed mode. Instead of keeping the LED on during the tests, the LED was pulsed on and off. It was pulsed by using a DAC on the LabPC+ card send out a voltage (via a -5x amplifier) which then went to an LED pulser. The LED pulser had an 8 ns charge cable. Upon reception of a trigger, the LED pulser sent out a fast voltage pulse to the LED, which had a 4 ns clip line. Everything was timed in such that the LED would pulse, excite the PMT and the EG&G FND-100 fast PIN photodiode + preamp, the induced signals from the PMT, fast photodiode, and 10% of the LED pulser signal would all arrive at the LeCroy 2249A charge-integrating ADC during the time that an ADC gate was being applied to the ADC. The integrated charges from thes three signals were recorded for each "event", along with their pedestal (LED-off) values. Each ADC count was equal to 0.25 pC of integrated charge.

A large number (1000) of measurements were made for each different LED pulser voltage and/or PMT high voltage setting, the mean and sigma of the ADC integrated charge distribution of the PMT signal were computed on-line. Again, a "burn-in" procedure, as described above, was used before any measurements were made, to eliminate any transient/PMT instability effects.

The PMT gain in pulsed light mode was computed from the gaussian-distributed statistics associated with the width (sigma) of the (pedestal-subtracted) ADC integrated charge distribution for the PMT signal:

\[<Q>(\rightarrow\ in\ pC)\ =\ 0.25\times<\ ADC> \tag{12}\]

\[\sigma_{Q}\ =\ 0.25\times\sqrt{\sigma_{ADC}^{2}\ -\ \sigma_{pedestal}^{2}}. \tag{13}\]

The number of photoelectrons can be calculated from these numbers:

\[N_{pe}\ =\ \left(\frac{<Q>}{\sigma_{Q}}\right)^{2}\ =\ \left(\frac{<ADC>^{2}}{ \sigma_{ADC}^{2}-\sigma_{pedestal}^{2}}\right) \tag{14}\]

From the number of photoelectrons, the PMT gain can be computed via:

\[G\ =\ \frac{<ADC>}{(\frac{Charge\,e}{ADC\,count})*N_{pe}}\ =\ \frac{\sigma_{ADC}^{2}}{(6.4 \times 10^{-7}C)*<ADC>} \tag{15}\]

The number of photoelectrons as a function of HV for the 20 Hamamatsu R-5900 PMT's we tested are shown in Fig. 12; the PMT gains as a function of HV for the 20 Hamamatsu R-5900 PMT's are shown in Fig. 13. The nominal PMT HV's for G = 10\({}^{5}\) operating conditions were again obtained from least-squares power-law fit of the Gain vs. HV relation. These nominal PMT HV's for each of the 20 Hamamatsu R-5900 PMT's are summarized in Table IV below. Again, the fit \(\chi^{2}\) results are extremely good - no significant saturation effects are observable for the LED pulsed light measurements, typically corresponding to \(\sim\) 2500-3000 produced photoelectrons/pulse,roughly equivalent to the light level of the 10 nA  DC light measurements. However, we note two things: One is the slight reduction in accuracy for determining the nominal PMT HV for G = 10\({}^{5}\) operation - the pulsed light data measurements have intrinsically larger point-to-point uncertainties. Second, upon comparison of the nominal PMT HV's for G = 10\({}^{5}\) as obtained from pulsed LED measurements, these results are systematically 20-50 volts _lower_ than the nominal PMT HV's for G = 10\({}^{5}\) obtained from the 10 nA and/or 30 nA DC light measurements. There appears to be no significant, overall systematic shift between PMT HV's for G = 10\({}^{5}\) between results obtained from 10 nA vs. 30 nA DC light measurements. The origin of this downward 20-50 volt shift for nominal PMT HV's for G = 10\({}^{5}\) obtained via pulsed LED light measurements vs. those obtained via DC light measurements is worrisome to us, and hints at possible PMT saturation effects present in the DC light method.

The current DAQ system used for PMT testing at UI is rate-limited to \(\sim\) 1500 Hz (the I/O bandwidth of the ISA bus of the Dell PC). Further studies of the pulse rate dependence of the Hamamatsu R-5900 PMT, as well as other types of PMT's have been carried out subsequent to the measurement of the Hamamatsu R-5900 PMT performance characteristics described in this note. We found that indeed, there are measureable rate-dependence effects at higher light levels that can cause saturation effects in the PMT. These new rate-dependence measurements and results will be discussed in a separate, soon-to-be forthcoming note.

## 8 Conclusions

We have found that:

* removal of all solder flux and residue is necessary to eliminate unwanted surface leakage currents on the board, which are highly sensitive to humidity in the atmosphere. In-situ in ATLAS in the LHC collision hall, this is another good reason for using a dry-nitrogen inerting atmosphere, for long-term benefits of TileCal HV reliability and stability, with low "dark current" noise.
* From PMT photocathode sensitivity measurements, 6 R-5900 PMT's were identified that had high photocathode resistivity. These PMT's (6A 23CA, 6A 23C1, 6A 25C2, 6A 25C4, 6A 25C5, and 6A 25C6) all apparently from the same "batch" (?) plateaued at around 100 Volts for a

Table 4: R-5900 PMT HV’s for Gain = \(10^{5}-\) Pulsed Light MeasurementDC light level of 30 nA. We believe that these 6 PMT's should not be used in the ATLAS TileCal Module 0 Prototype.
* Hamamatsu R-5900 photocathode sensitivity differences are on the order of 5% with the exception of the "bad", high-resitivity photocathode PMT's we identified.
* The range of high voltages needed for a gain of 10\({}^{5}\) varies between 630 and 770 Volts. This is well within the required PMT operating parameters (aturn-on voltage of \(\sim\) 400 Volts and a maximum voltage of 900 Volts).
* We noticed a systematic, downward shift of \(\sim\) 20-50 volts for the HV's associated with G = 10\({}^{5}\) operation as obtained via pulsed LED light methods vs. those obtained via DC light methods. Preliminary studies of the Hamamatsu R-5900 PMT rate dependence over the 0-10 MHz range indicates that PMT saturation effects at higher light levels and high rates can cause such an effect, hence we suspect our DC light measurements of the PMT gain vs. HV may have been skewed higher in HV by such saturation effects; the pulsed light measurement results appear at this moment in time to be the more accurate results.

We will keep the five worst tubes for futher development of the PMT testing facility at UI - tubes 6A23CA, 6A25C2, 6A25C4, 6A25C5, and 6A25C6. The three best tubes were 6A11CA, 6A12C7, and 6A12DA. We sent these three, along with the rest of the Hamamatsu R-5900 PMT's to CERN to be included for use in Module 0.

In summary, all of the tubes tested with the exception of the 6 bad tubes are suitable to be used in the TileCal Module 0.
