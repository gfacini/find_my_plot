Abstract: in this note we present the analysis of the laser data taken during the last test beam in October 1997. The test beam configuration of the laser system will be introduced. The stability of the read-out electronics of the two extended barrel modules 0, determined by the relative gains, will be shown. The number of photoelectrons will be calculated and correlations between the Cs and the laser systems will be shown as well.

**1. General concepts**

The general concepts of the laser system can be found in the TDR and in a previous Tilecal note (TILECAL-NO-39). Here, we will concentrate only on the test beam specifications. Figure 1 shows the layout of the laser box. Downstream the laser head, the light is splitted into two parts. One part goes to the three photodiodes, which measure the laser pulses, and to the timing PMT. The second part passes through a filter wheel (which holds 3 filters: \(\times 1\), \(\times 10\) and \(\times 100\)), comes out of the box and goes to the light setting box (the Coimbra box). After this box, the laser light is sent to each module (one clear fibre for each module). Here, the light is splitted again and sent to each photomultiplier at the level of the fibre bundles (one clear fibre per PMT). The whole laser system is controlled by a VME system in the control room. The VME is also connected to the Main DAQ of the Tilecal.

The laser system is able to run in several modes:

- Pedestal mode for the photodiodes.

- Alpha source mode for checking the stability of the photodiodes.

- Charge injection mode for checking the linearity of the photodiodes.

- Laser mode.

- "Auto" mode. In this mode, the laser is controlled by the main DAQ. When a particle run is started by the main DAQ, a pedestal run and an alpha source run are automatically done before the laser light is delivered.

During the data taking, the laser was running at 100 Hz and the light was sent to the modules during one second, at the end of the physics burst (outside burst). In the usual setting, the laser was delivering a train of 16 pulses of different intensities which, in association with the three filters, cover the entire dynamic range of the read-out electronics. It was running either in a stand alone mode or controlled by the main acquisition.

The read-out of the photodiodes is done in two ways:

- In the alpha source mode, the read-out is done by the VME internal acquisition. In principle, this information should have been sent to the main DAQ through the VIC, but it didn't work correctly.

- In the pedestal or in the laser mode, it is done both by the VME and by the main DAQ.

## 2 Decrease of the laser light

During the test beam period we have observed a continuous decrease of the light delivered by the laser. It can be seen on figure 2 which represents the average value

Figure 1: _Layout of the laser box. The alpha source wheel is missing._

of each photodiode versus time. Day 65 is the \(1^{st}\) of October.

On this plot, the responses of the photodiodes are the ones given by the ADCs connected to the main acquisition. The light has decreased by almost a factor of two between the beginning and the end of the test beam. There are two hypothesis to explain this decrease. The first one concerns the frequency doubler which was damaged and fixed in July 1997, but it was not a complete repair (it was just moved from its original position). In April 1998 the laser has been sent to the manufacturer to be completly fixed and they found out that one of the laser pump diode was not 100% powerfull. This point is the second hypothesis. These two things will be fixed for the 1998 test beam. Moreover we can see that from time to time the ADC connected to the first photodiode Las1 was not working correctly.

Figure 3: _Alpha peak measurement over a period of 40 days._

## 3 Stability of the Photodiodes

Before looking at the stability of the read-out electronics, one has to check that the monitoring system itself is stable. The stability of the photodiodes is controlled by the use of an alpha source passing in front of each photodiode.

Figure 3 represents the alpha peak stability during the test beam period. The left side shows the alpha peak for the three photodiodes versus time, and the right side shows the projection onto the vertical axis normalized to the average of all the measurements. Some problems appeared for the second photodiode, problems probably coming from the electronics. For the two other photodiodes, the alpha peak measurement is very stable, the RMS of the distribution being \(\approx 0.35\%\) for both.

We also looked at the stability of the photodiodes over a longer period (5 months), and it remains the same.

## 4 Determination of the relative gains

For a laser pulse and for a given PMT, the relative gain is defined as the ratio of the reponse of the PMT to the response of one of the photodiodes:

Figure 4: Typical plot of PMT vs Photodiode (photodiode \(\#3\) in that case).

\[Gain=\frac{PMT}{Phot\,od\,ode-pedestal}\]

The determination of the relative gains allows to check the stability of the overall read-out electronics and also to have a diagnostic of the good working of the indivual channels. Concerning the second part, we found out that the channel \(ANL\#8\) did not work during almost the entire test beam period.

If the photodiode is stable, the stability of the relative gains leads directly to the stability of the read-out electronics. It has been shown in the previous section that the third photodiode is quite stable. We therefore didn't make any alpha peak corrections to the determination of the relative gains.

For the test beam period, the relative gains have been determined on a run by run basis. We used two methods. The first one consists in fitting the curve \(PMT\ vs\ Photodiode\) by a linear function and taking the slope. The second one consists in taking the average over all the laser events of the ratio PMT/(Photodiode - pedestal). In principle the first method is the best one because it avoids pedestal subtraction problems. On the other hand, if the number of laser events is small, the fit may not work properly.

For a 10000 events run, we had roughly in average 900 laser events and therefore 300 laser events for each filter. A typical plot of \(PMT\ vs\ Photodiode\) is shown on figure 4. We can see the three slopes corresponding to the three filters. The train of 16 pulses insures an overlap between the three ranges offered by the filters.

### Stability of the modules

Figure 5 represents the relative gains normalized to the run 40954 (which is roughly in the middle of the test beam period) averaged over all the PMTs, and for both modules. For the ANL module we actually averaged over 27 PMTs since the channel \(ANL\#8\) was dead for most of the time.

On this plot the relative gains have been calculated using the second method (directly the ratio PMT/Photodiode), the third photodiode Las3 and the zero attenuation filter. More than 500 runs are represented. Only a few runs have been taken out because they were tagged as bad or because the laser was off. We have four possible combinations to determine the relative gains, two methods \(\times\) two photodiodes (we exclude the first one Las1). They all give the same conclusions.

The two modules show basically the same behavior. At the beginning of the period the gains are relatively low and afterwards they go up to be stable within 1% for most the time. At the day 88 there is a downwards step and then the gains go down slowly. Over the entire period the stability of the relative gains varies by almost 3%, which is pretty large.

One important point is that if the two modules have the same behavior, it is also the same thing for all the PMTs. The variation of their reponses is almost identical.

During the test beam, we didn't take a lot of CIS (Charge Injection System) calibration runs. We took one at the beginning and one at the end. Between the two measurements, we observed (see Jorgen Sjolin's transparencies of the March 97 ATLAS week, TILE-TR-96) a drop of 2 to 3%. This drop may explain the step of the relative gains at the day 88 which is of the same amount.

The origin of this unstability has to be an overall effect since it affects all the channels and moreover by the same amount. The only things that we had under control are the temperature inside the drawers and the high voltages. It has been shown that the very small variations of these two elements cannot explain such a large unstability. The CIS constants have changed and since we don't know what happened in between the two runs, the unstability of the relative gains may simply come from the unstability of the CIS constants. This is only an assumption and the

Figure 5: _Normalized relative gains versus time for both modules._

problem has still to be solved.

It is clear that we will have to do more systematics checks during the next test beam to make sure that we will understand everything.

### Repeatability test

To check the repeatability of the relative gains measurements, we took 21 runs of 500 laser events each in a small period of time (2 hours). All along the test, the alpha peak as well as the pedestals of the photodiodes were controlled and were found to be very stable.

Figure 6 represents the distribution of the relative gains averaged over all the PMTs for each module normalized to the average of the 21 runs. The RMS of the

Figure 6: _Distribution of the relative gains averaged over all the PMTs for both modules during the repeatability test._

distribution for both modules is better than 0.15%. This is very good, as good as the accuracy of the measurement of the gains by the \({}^{137}Cs\) system, and in agreement with the 1996 measurements on old modules. This result could even be better by weighting the responses of the three photodiodes.

## 5 Correction of non-linearity of the photodiodes

The linearity of the photodiodes (their associated electronics actually) can be checked by the use of a simple charge injection system. Charges are injected at the level of the electronics of the three photodiodes and are monitored by an additionnal ADC called Las0 in the following.

Figure 7: _The top plot represents the reponse of the third photodiode Las3 versus the reference Las0 for a charge injection run and the bottom plot represents the response of Las3 for a laser run._

We took several linearity runs (LPG runs) during the test beam period and they all lead to the same conclusions. On figure 7, the top plot represents the response of the third photodiode Las3 versus the reference Las0 for one these runs. The dots represent the data points and the curve represents a linear fit to the points which are still in the linearity zone of the photodiode (ADC reponse below 2000 counts). The bottom plot represents the distribution on Las3 for laser events and for a laser run taken at the very beginning of the test beam period (run 40449).

For clearness we didn't represent the two other photodiodes Las1 and Las2. Las2 and Las3 have very similar behaviors whereas Las1 is much more linear. These linearity considerations are directly connected to the electronics associated to the photodiodes. Using the next evolution improves a lot the linearity range. We never used Las1 for the determination of the relative gains mainly because the ADC channel connected to this photodiode didn't work correctly from time to time (see figure 2).

For the run 40449, the deviation from the linearity is negligible up to the ADC count 2500. For the highest laser pulses (ADC count 3000, see bottom plot of figure 7) the deviation is never greater than 3%. But the relative weight of the highest energy pulses giving a non-negligible deviation is small compared to the low and medium energy pulses giving a negligible deviation. The overall deviation over the entire laser dynamics is small, leading to a correction of the relative gains lower than 1%. Nevertheless this correction is of that amount as long as the laser pulses reach 3000 ADC counts. As it is said in section 2 the laser light decreased quickly and after a few days the laser pulses reached only 2500 ADC counts. So after a few days the corrections on relative gains became totally negligible. In conclusion, we never applied corrections of non-linearity of the photodiodes on the relative gains, even for the runs taken at the beginning of the test beam period.

For the 1998 test beam, the electronics of the photodiodes will be checked and we will probably have to apply correction factors.

## 6 Gain variation measurements and correlations between Cs and Laser systems

Following the measurements that we did in 1998 during the laser baths to identify the origin of the so-called downdrift (we will not discuss that in this note), we had decided to do additional tests in order to check the correlation between the Cs and the laser systems concerning the determination of the gains of the photomultipliers.

Roughly speaking, the Cs system probes the optical part of the read-out chain and the laser system probes the electronics part, including the photomultiplier and the light mixer (see figure 8). For a Cs run, the light issued from the scintillator passes through the shifting fibre and enters the PMT block by the light mixer. The signal of the photomultiplier is treated by the slow electronics (the integrators). For a laser run, the light, by a clear fibre, arrives directly at the level of the fibre bundle. The signal of the photomultiplier is then treated by the fast electronics (as the physics data). Basically, the only common part between the Cs and the laser system is the photomultiplier (actually the light mixer too).

For the R5900 photomultipliers, the absolute gain (G) is related to the high volt age (V) through the relation:

\[G=\alpha V^{\beta}\]

where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are parameters which have been determined when the photomultipliers had been charaterized. The most important parameter is \(\beta\) since it is the one that we use for the gain setting for example. Typical values are \(\beta=6.8\) for 8 stages PMTs and \(\beta=8.5\) for 10 stages PMTs. As \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are known, a variation of the gain due to the high voltage can be predicted.

The idea of the test we did was to verify that for a given variation of the high voltage, both the Cs and the laser systems were measuring the same variation of the gain.

This test was made on 5 channels of the BCN module: 3, 16, 30, 33 and 34. The high voltage on these channels was changed by \(\pm 0.2\), \(\pm 0.4\), \(\pm 0.8\), \(\pm 1.2\), \(\pm 1.6\) and \(\pm 2.V\) around the nominal value. At each setting the gain of the photomultipliers was measured by the two systems.

The results are shown on figure 9. The top plot represents the gain of the PMT (we only plotted one channel, but the four other ones are identical) measured by the two systems, normalized to the gain measured at the nominal high voltage versus the variation of the high voltage. The bottom plot represents the distribution of the ratio of the normalized gains measured by the laser system to the normalized gains measured by the Cs system, for all the high voltage settings and for the five channels.

The RMS of the distribution of the ratios is 0.3%: the correlation between the two systems is very good. Let us mention that the Cs light

Figure 9: _The top represents the variation of the gain of the photomultiplier as measured by the two systems versus the variation of the high voltage, for the channel \(BCN\#16\). The bottom plot represents the distribution of the ratio of the gains measured by the laser to the gains measured by the Cs._

caracterictics which are quite different: the Cs light produces a DC current of a few hundreds of nA in the photomultipliers whereas the laser light produces a pulsed current (at 100 Hz) of a few tens of mA. The wavelenghts are different too (480 nm for the light issued from the Cs signal and 523 nm for the laser light). With such different conditions, it is remarquable to find a so good correlation.

The other important point is that the variation of the gain that we observe (by any of the systems) is very close to the expected one since we expect a variation of the gain of 1% for a variation of the high voltage of 1\(V\) (see top plot of figure 9).

## 7. Number of photoelectrons

### 7.1. Introduction

A PMT illuminated by monoenergetic light pulses delivers responses the distribution of which has a mean value \(E\) and a width \(\sigma\). The spread of this distribution is due to statistical fluctuations on the number of photoelectrons \(N\) going out of the photocathode. The relation between \(E\), \(\sigma\) and \(N\) is:

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{1+f}{\sqrt{N}}\]

where \(f\) is the 'noise factor' and will be taken as zero in the following.

Since we calibrate the PMTs on a large dynamic range, and because of the laser jitter in energy, we don't have a sample of monoeneregetic pulses with a sufficiently large number of events to apply directly the above formula. So the first step is to find and validate a method to extract the number of photoelectrons from the whole distribution of the laser events (restricted to a given filter of the filter wheel).

At a given energy \(E_{A}\), it is easy to see that the quantity \(\frac{\sigma^{2}}{E_{A}}=\frac{E_{A}}{N}\) is proportional to the absolute gain \(g\), which can be considered here as a constant for a given PMT. If there is a number \(n_{A}\) of events at such energy, applying the definition of the standard deviation, one gets:

\[Cg=\frac{1}{n_{A}}\sum_{i=1}^{i=n_{A}}\frac{(Q_{i}-E_{A})^{2}}{E_{A}}\]

where \(C\) is the constant of proportionnality and \(Q_{i}\) the response of the PMT. The quantity \(E_{A}\) can be measured by the photodiodes (with a small fluctuation due to the photodiode noise, the contribution of which is studied further).

The same kind of equation can be obtained for other energies \(E_{B},...\), each one with the same first member \(Cg\). Adding all these equations, we finally get:

\[nCg=\sum_{I=1}^{I=n}\frac{(Q_{I}-E_{I})^{2}}{E_{I}}\]

where \(n\) is the total number of events.

So the absolute gain of the PMTs (multiplied by a constant which depends only on the unit in which is expressed the response of the PMTs : picocoulomb, GeV, etc), can be determined as the average of the distribution of the variable \(\frac{(Q-E)^{2}}{E}\), where, for a given event, \(Q\) is the PMT response and \(E\) the energy of the event. \(E\) can be obtained as the product of the photodiode response by the relative gain (see section 4).

Finally, the inverse of the quantity \(Cg\) gives the number of photoelectrons per GeV or per pC, depending on the unit of \(E\).

### Simulation

#### 7.2.1 Principle

In order to validate the method explained above, to determine the correction to be done on the results due to the photodiode noise and to evaluate the accuracy of the method, a simulation has been performed. The steps are the following:

- 16 equally spread levels are generated.

- The laser output is simulated by adding a random gaussian number (\(\sigma\sim 25\)) to each level (jitter in energy).

- The photodiode measurement is simulated by adding a random gaussian number (\(\sigma\sim 4\)) to the previous number (influence of the photodiode noise).

- The number of photoelectrons \(n_{pe}\) is calculated multiplying the laser output by the relative gain (e.g. 0.1) and by the conversion factor (e.g. 40 photoelectrons per GeV). This last value is the input of the simulation and has to be found again after the calculation, exposed in the previous subsection, is performed on the simulated data.

- The PMT response is obtained by adding the statistics contribution (\(\sigma=\sqrt{n_{pe}}\) ) to the number of photoelectrons and dividing by the conversion factor.

Reiterating the operation as much as necessary, we get a set of data containing the photodiode response and the PMT response. Therefore one can display the variable \(\frac{(Q-E)^{2}}{E}\), and thus deduce the result as the mean value of the distribution of this variable.

#### 7.2.2 Results

The first checks have to concern the accuracy in which the number of photoelectrons per GeV is determinated. This accuracy depends obviously on the number of events of the sample. For a given number of events (100, 500, 2000 and 20,000 events), 100 sets of data have been generated, allowing to determine the dispersion of the results. Figure 10 shows that, from 1000 events, the accuracy is better than Figure 11: _Systematic error on the number of photoelectrons versus the photodiode noise._

Figure 10: _Statistical error on the number of photoelectrons versus the number of events._

3%. So the special laser runs, which have about 3000 events for each filter, allow a good estimation of the number of photoelectrons.

Since there is a tiny noise on the photodiodes (\(\sim 3.7\) channels), the quantity E is known with a certain dispersion. That leads to underestimate the number of photoelectrons (like the noise of the PMTs and their associated electronics, the influence of which is not studied here because of its weak value). Putting different inputs of the value of this noise in the simulation procedure, the induced systematic error can be observed. The plot on figure 11 shows the dependance of the measured number of photoelectrons versus the photodiode noise for an input of 40 photoelectrons per GeV. The correction is 2.7 photoelectrons per GeV. Of course, this correction depends on the actual number of photoelectrons per GeV, as it is shown in figure 12 and a quadratic fit allows to pass from the calculated number of photoelectrons to the true number of photoelectrons. For getting the actual noise of the photodiode, the correction function is then:

\[(n_{\it pe})_{true}=0.9931\ (n_{pe})_{calc.}+0.277\times 10^{-2}\ (n_{\it pe })_{calc.}^{2}-0.2067\]

Complementary studies have been performed to check the influence of other parameters (distribution binning, cuts, etc). These parameters have a very little effect on the results.

The method allowing to calculate the number of photoelectrons using all the laser data and not only a single peak has therefore been shown to be valid, with known corrections and accuracy.

Figure 12: _True number of photoelectrons versus calculated number of photoelectrons._

### Number of photoelectrons of the BCN module

Applying the method exposed above with its corrections on the BCN module PMTs, we get the values displayed in figure 13. The evidence is that the PMTs with compressor have lower number of photoelectrons (i.e. higher gain or extra noise) than the PMTs with bigain electronics. The mean value of the number of photoelectrons per GeV is 27.0 for the compressor channels and 35.2 for the bigain channels.

On the other hand, there is no significative difference between odd and even PMTs (the mean values are respectively 30.7 and 31.0 photoelectrons per GeV).

The determination of the number of photoelectrons allows to evaluate the laser light incoming on the PMTs : the response of a PMT is the product of the absolute gain by the incoming light. Therefore, the light received by a PMT is proportional to the product of the relative gain by the number of photoelectrons. The mean value of the light (in arbitrary units) is 3.1 for the odd PMTs and 2.8 for the even PMTs. This result is in agreement with the routing difference of the clear fibres in the module, which are longer for the even PMTs, because they cross the girder.

## Conclusion

We have demonstrated that the relative gains are determined with a very good accuracy. Their variation during the test beam show a non-stability of the overall read-out electronics of almost 3% for both extended barrel modules 0. The variation of the gain of the photomultipliers induced by a variation of the high voltage measured by both the Cs and the laser systems are in very good agreement with the predicted variation. Correlations between the Cs and the laser systems had already

Figure 13: _Number of photoelectrons in each cell for both PMTs for the BCN module._been shown in the past, but with old module prototypes. The number of photoelectrons, determined by the use of the laser data, is 27 pe/GeV/PMT for the compressor channels and 35 pe/GeV/PMT for the bi-gain channels. This determination is in good agreement with other calculations.
