###### Abstract

A detailed study of the various possible mechanisms leading to \(Zb\bar{b}\) and \(Hb\bar{b}\) events in the final state is performed in the light of recent work released after the completion of the ATLAS Physics TDR. The cross-sections are computed using both analytical methods and the version 6.1 of the Pythia MC program. Some conclusions concerning the reliability of the various approaches are presented.

## 1 Introduction

The simulation of events containing a Higgs boson \(H\) or the gauge boson \(Z\), in addition to b-quarks, is required in a large number of searches described in the recent ATLAS Physics TDR [1]. The most interesting examples are related to Higgs boson searches in MSSM models. The production of a Higgs boson accompanied by b-quarks, and its subsequent decay into a pair of leptons, provides a clear signal for neutral Higgs bosons (\(h\), \(A\) or \(H\)) at large \(tg\beta\). Events containing a \(Z\) boson and b-quarks are, on the other side, an important source of background to identify this signal. In this note, an attempt is made to clarify the production mechanism for such events, in the light of recent work that became available only after the completion of the Physics TDR. This new work is relevant for both the computation of cross-sections [2] and the generation of events [3]. This note is organised as follows: in sections 2, 3 and 4 the various production mechanisms are reviewed together with computations of total cross-sections. In sections 5 and 6 the generation of events using Pythia and the effect of the selection cuts are discussed. Finally, conclusions are presented in section 7.

Cross-sections for \(Hb\bar{b}\) events

A final state \(Hb\bar{b}\) can be produced in gluon-gluon or light quark collisions. At LHC energies, the process \(q\bar{q}\to Hb\bar{b}\) is strongly suppressed, so only \(gg\to Hb\bar{b}\) is considered in the following. As shown in Fig.1, there are 3 possible ways to calculate the cross-section for this production process.

* Mechanism (a) is a _gg_ collision (in the Pythia language a \(2\to 3\) process). This mechanism, also called the 'Matrix Element approach' (ME), has been used in previous Physics TDR analyses.
* Mechanism (c) is a \(b\bar{b}\) annihilation (in the Pythia language a \(2\to 1\) process). In this approach the b-quark parton density function (PDF) is used in the calculation of the cross-section. This mechanism is called the 'Shower approach' in the Pythia manual.
* Mechanism (b) is a _bg_ collision (in the Pythia language a \(2\to 2\) process) and represents an intermediate option between the ME and the Shower approach. This option has only be considered in the simulation of \(Zb\bar{b}\) events to be discussed later and is only included here for completeness.

These three mechanisms contain apparently different initial and final states. However, in a shower MC program like Pythia, the initial b-quark is generated via 'backwards evolution' by gluon splitting into a \(b\bar{b}\) pair. For this reason, in all three cases the initial state is in fact a pair of gluons, and the final state the \(H\) boson with a \(b\bar{b}\) pair.

Figure 1: Three possible mechanisms leading to the production of a Higgs boson and a \(b\bar{b}\) pair. A single Feynman diagram is used to illustrate each mechanism, but a total of 8 diagrams contribute to (a). Concerning (b), processes like \(b\bar{b}\to Hg\) are also considered in order to keep all terms of the same order in \(\alpha_{s}\).

reduces the cross-sections by approximately a factor 2 at a scale of 100 GeV, irrespective of the approach used. As for the PDF's, CTEQ5L is used, since only LO is included. The PDF scale in all these calculations is the Higgs boson mass (see discussion later). Finally, only Standard Model Higgs couplings are considered, the extrapolation to MSSM being trivially obtained after proper scaling of these couplings.

As discussed in ref.[2], the large discrepancies between the various approaches can be attributed to the presence of large logarithmic terms of the type \(Log(m_{\,H}/m_{\,b})\). NL O corrections to approach (c) are also computed in ref.[2]. They are found to be small for Higgs masses larger than 100 GeV as shown in Fig.2 (note that CTEQ5M is used in this case). As explained in ref.[2], process (b) leads to corrections of order \(\alpha_{s}\) to process (c), to be computed at NLO. In addition to \(gb\to Hb\), other processes like \(b\bar{b}\to Hg\) also contribute to the NLO correction. It is found that both corrections are very large but almost cancel each other, explaining the smallness of the NLO correction. In a previous article [5] by some of the authors of ref.[2], only the \(gb\to H\,b\) correction was taken into account, thus leading to a large negative correction to the LO cross-section. It was argued consequently that the ME approach (a) provided a better estimation of the cross-section. Once all corrections are included, this conclusion must be reconsidered.

## 3 Cross-sections for \(Zb\bar{b}\) events

The discussion in the previous section about \(Hb\bar{b}\) events is also relevant for \(Zb\bar{b}\) events. In this case, however, we also have to consider light quark collisions as shown in Fig.3. This type of events is strongly suppressed in the Higgs case since the Higgs coupling to quarks is proportional to the quark mass, but not in the \(Z\) case. The discussion on these events is postponed to the next section.

Figure 3: Feynman diagram showing a \(Zb\bar{b}\) event, where the Z is produced in the collision of light quarks.

Events where the \(Z\) occurs in a _gg_ collision can be classified according to types (a), (b) and (c), as in Fig.1. A qualitative discussion on the reliability of these production mechanisms is found in the Pythia 6.1 manual [6]. It can be noted that an implementation of the process \(gg\to Zb\overline{b}\) (ME approach) existed in older versions of Pythia, but was removed due to inefficiency in the generation of events. Consequently, approach (b) (intermediate approach) was extensively used in the Physics TDR to compute background events. Recently, the ME approach was reintroduced as an external process in Pythia [3], thus allowing a comparison between the predictions of the various approaches.

Fig.4 shows the \(Zb\overline{b}\) cross-section computed for options (a), (b) and (c). The calculations for (b) and (c) are analytical (see details in the Appendix). In these calculations, CTEQ5L PDF's are used and the PDF scale is set to be the mass of the \(Z\) boson (see discussion later). For approach (a), the Pythia result is shown, since no analytical program for public use is available to compute this cross-section.

Figure 4: \(\sigma(Zb\overline{b})\times\) BR(Z\(\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\)) calculated according to the production mechanisms (a), (b) and (c). For mechanisms (a) and (c) the total integrated cross-sections, used as a reference, are displayed. For mechanism (b), the dependence on the minimum \(p_{T}\) allowed in the hard collision is explicitly shown.

An additional difficulty in the intermediate approach (b) is the divergence of the cross-section due to collinear and infrared singularities. Collinear singularities appear in the exchange of b-quarks in the t-channel if the quark is massless. The infrared singularity appears when a gluon with zero energy is emitted in the process \(b\bar{b}\to Zg\). The final result depends strongly on the procedure used to cancel these singularities. In Pythia, b-quarks are treated as all other light quarks in the hard process and are therefore assumed to be massless. Both the collinear and the infrared singularity are then cancelled by imposing a minimum \(p_{T}\) in the hard collision, the default value being 1 GeV. Fig.4 shows for approach (b) the dependence of the cross-section on this parameter \(p_{T}\). The total integrated cross-sections for (a) and (c) are also displayed as a reference. A 'natural' cut-off for approach (b) could be the b-quark mass of 3 GeV at the \(Z\) scale (this was our choice in Fig.2). A more judicious choice seems however a \(p_{T}\) of approximately 10 GeV where the cross-sections (b) and (c) become comparable as shown in Fig.4. This large \(p_{T}\) value was in fact selected for Physics TDR analyses.

As in the \(Hb\bar{b}\) case, NLO corrections are only available for approach (c). These corrections are the same as in the Drell-Yan case and were computed a long time ago at NLO and even NNLO orders (see ref.[7] for a computation in the \(\overline{MS}\) scheme). They are are found to be small as shown in Fig.4.

## 4 Choice of parameters and scale dependence of the cross-sections

The cross-section of approach (c), \(b\bar{b}\to H/Z\), depends on the choice of the structure function \(F_{b}(x,\,Q^{2}\,)\) and, in the \(H\) case, on the choice of the b-quark mass \(m_{b}(Q^{2})\), present in the Higgs coupling to b-quarks. In these processes of type \(2\to 1\), there is a general consensus to select a scale \(Q^{2}\) equal to \(M^{2}\), \(M\) being the mass of the heavy particle produced in the collision. This implies a b-quark mass of approximately 3 GeV for scales around 100 GeV. It can be noted that \(Q^{2}=M^{2}\) is equivalent in this case to \(Q^{2}=\)s, s being the partonic centre-of-mass energy of the collision.

The case of approach (a), \(gg\to b\bar{b}H/Z\), is more involved and there is no general consensus concerning the choice of the scale \(Q^{2}\). The cross-section depends in this case on the structure function \(F_{g}(x,\,Q^{2}\,)\), the strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{s}(Q^{2}\,)\), and the b-quark mass \(m_{b}(Q^{2}\,)\), which appears in this case both in the coupling of the Higgs and in the phase-space integration of the matrix element. Some authors prefer a scale \(Q^{2}=\)s, where s is event-dependent in this case, and others prefer to keep a constant scale \(Q^{2}=M^{2}\)This second option has been adopted in the present paper. In the case of the b-quark mass, some authors prefer to use a pole mass of approximately 5 GeV, and others the running mass of 3 GeV at a scale of 100 GeV (for a recent discussion about the b-quark mass, see for example [8] and references therein). There are also intermediate options where the pole mass is selected to perform the phase-space integration of the matrix element, but the running mass is selected for the Higgs coupling. In the present note, the running mass is selected in all cases.

Once a choice of parameters is made, the sensitivity of the cross-section to the scale \(Q^{2}\) can be investigated. As commented before, the \(Q^{2}\) scale enters in 3 different places according to our choice of parameters: in the structure functions, in the stong coupling constant and in the b-quark mass. All can be varied at a time, and the result is shown for the \(Z\) case, as an example, in Fig.5. It is interesting to note that approaches (a) and (c) converge at a scale of approximately \(M/2\). The result of approach (b) is also included for completeness.

## 5 Generation of events using Pythia

The MC program Pythia 6.1 implemented in the ATLFAST framework [9] is used in this section both to compute cross-sections and generate events in the ATLAS detector. The list of Pythia subprocesses corresponding to the various approaches described in the previous sections is summarised in Table 1.

Some of theses subprocesses are still not implemented in the current version of Pythia and others are available only as external processes. The cross-sections computed using Pythia are in good agreement with the analytical calculations presented in previous sections. For example, the cross-section in approach (c) (process \(b\overline{b}\to Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\)) is 56 pb according to Pythia,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \hline _hard_ & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{_Pythia subprocess_} & _comments_ \\ _process_ & _X=H_ & _X=Z_ & \\ \hline \(gg\to X\,b\,\overline{b}\) & 1 21 & ext. & ME approach (a) \\ \(q\bar{q}\to X\,b\bar{b}\) & 1 22 & ext. & available as ext. process for Z \\ \hline \(gq\to X\,q\) & (32) & 30 & intermediate approach (b) \\ \(gq\to X\,q\) & (17) & 15 & not implemented for H \\ \hline \(q\bar{q}\to X\) & 3 & 1 & shower approach (c) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Pythia subprocesses for the production of \(Zb\overline{b}\) and \(H\,b\overline{b}\) eventsto be compared to 58 pb in the analytical approach. The default Pythia PDF's, CTEQ5L, are used in these calculations.

A list of all cross-sections obtained in the \(Z\) case is displayed in Table 2. This table includes processes where the \(Z\) is produced in the collision of light quarks, as announced in the previous section. This type of events is recognised by inspection of the Pythia tree. They contain b-quarks in the tree, but only light quarks in the hard process. The contribution of such events (without imposing any particular requirement to the b-quarks) to the total cross-section is 17%, 23% and 17% for approaches (a), (b) and (c), respectively.

Figure 5: Cross-section for \(Z\) production at the LHC, calculated according to the production mechanisms (a), (b) and (c), as a function of the scale \(Q^{2}\). The same scale is used to compute the structure functions, the strong coupling constant and the b-quark mass. In the case of approach (b), a \(p_{T}\) cut of 10 GeV has been applied to compute the cross-section.

## 6 Cross-sections after selection cuts

Simulated events using Pythia can be used to compute signal and background events after applying selection cuts. These cuts depend however on each specific analysis. As an example, Table 3 displays the cross-sections for the same processes as in Table 2, before and after applying the following cuts to select events:

* A \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) pair with invariant mass inside a mass window of \(\pm\) 4 GeV around 90 GeV. Both muons should have a \(p_{T}\) exceeding 6 GeV and at least one of them should exceed 20 GeV. The acceptance in rapidity is 2.5.
* At least one reconstructed b-jet, using usual ATLFAST criteria, with \(p_{T}\) exceeding 25 GeV and inside a rapidity acceptance of 2.5.

These cuts are typical cuts used to select events where the the MSSM Higgs boson with lowest mass, \(h\), is produced in association with a pair of b-quarks and decays subsequently into a pair of muons. The mass window in this example is centered at 90 GeV. If this central value is displaced away from the \(Z\) mass, processes with virtual photons interfering with the \(Z\) should also be considered. As can be seen in Table 3, the effect of these cuts is a reduction in the difference between the cross-sections of approaches (a) and (c). It can also be noted that the fraction of \(Z\) events produced in the collision of light quarks is reduced by the selection cuts, since they only represent after cuts 10%, 11% and 11% of the total cross-section, for approaches (a), (b) and (c), respectively.

It is instructive to study the effect of other type of cuts as well. There are various searches where a double b-tag is demanded. Table 4 displays, forthe various approaches, cross-sections before cuts (BC) and after applying cuts in the single-tag mode (AC1) and the double-tag mode (AC2), where two b-quark jets with \(p_{T}\) in excess of 15 GeV are selected. In the last line of this table, the ratio between the result according to the shower approach (c) and the ME approach (a) is calculated. This ratio is 1.7 before cuts, 1.2 after cuts in the single-tag mode, and 0.8 after cuts in the double-tag mode. Selection cuts may therefore affect considerably the results obtained in the various approaches. It is also interesting to note that in the double-tag case, approach (c) yields after cuts a smaller cross-section than approach (a), reversing in this way the result obtained for the total cross-section.

The same exercise can be done in the Higgs case. As commented before, the neutral Higgs boson with lowest mass in MSSM models, \(h\), may decay

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline \hline _hard process_ & \(\sigma.Br(BC)\) (pb) & \(\sigma.Br(AC1)\) (pb) & \(\sigma.Br(AC2)\) (pb) \\ \hline \(gg\to Zb\bar{b}\) & & & \\ \(q\bar{q}\to Zb\bar{b}\) & sum(a)=39.5 & sum(a)=5.5 & sum(a)=1.0 \\ \hline \(g\bar{b}\to Zg\) & & & \\ \(g\bar{b}\to Zq+(b\bar{b})\) & & & \\ \(q\bar{q}\to Zg+(b\bar{b})\) & sum(b)=61.4 & sum(b)=9.1 & sum(b)=1.2 \\ \hline \(b\bar{b}\to Z\) & & & \\ \(q\bar{q}\to Z+(b\bar{b})\) & sum(c)=67.2 & sum(c)=6.7 & sum(c)=0.8 \\ \hline \hline _Ratio (c)/(a)_ & 1.7 & 1.2 & 0.8 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Cross-sections before cuts (BC) and after cuts (AC1 for single mode and AC2 for double tag mode)

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline \hline _hard process_ & \(\sigma.Br(BC)\) (pb) & \(\sigma.Br(AC)\) (pb) \\ \hline \(gg\to Zb\bar{b}\) & 32.9 & & 4.85 & \\ \(q\bar{q}\to Zb\bar{b}\) & 6.6 & sum(a)=39.5 & 0.59 & sum(a)=5.45 \\ \hline \(g\bar{b}\to Zb\) & 39.0 & & 7.77 & \\ \(b\bar{b}\to Zg\) & 8.2 & & 0.38 & \\ \(gq\to Zq+(b\bar{b})\) & 9.1 & & 0.53 & \\ \(q\bar{q}\to Zg+(b\bar{b})\) & 5.2 & sum(b)=61.4 & 0.40 & sum(b)=9.07 \\ \hline \(b\bar{b}\to Z\) & 55.9 & & 6.03 & \\ \(q\bar{q}\to Z+(b\bar{b})\) & 11.3 & sum(c)=67.2 & 0.65 & sum(c)=6.68 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Cross-sections before (BC) and after cuts (AC) (single tag mode)into muon pairs. This decay mode is of course strongly suppressed, but this suppression is compensated at large values of \(tg\beta\). As an example, we assume a Higgs boson mass of 90 GeV and \(tg\beta=15\). The corresponding cross-sections according to approaches (a) and (c) are displayed in Table 5. In this case, approach (b) is not included since this option is not available in the current version of Pythia. As in the \(Z\) case, we note that selection cuts reduce the difference between the various options. In this case, however, the reduction is not as large as in the \(Z\) case, and some discrepancy persists, even in the double-tag selection mode.

## 7 Discussion and conclusions

Several approaches in the computation of cross-sections and generation of events are available for processes where \(H\,b\overline{b}\) or \(Z\,b\overline{b}\) are present in the final state. In these approaches, the hard process is considered to be a collision of the type \(2\to 3\) (a), \(2\to 2\) (b) or \(2\to 1\) (c). At LHC energies these approaches lead to different results, not only in the computation of total cross-sections, but also after applying selection cuts. In approach (b), there are difficulties due to the divergence of the total cross-section. This divergence is cancelled in Pythia by imposing a minimum \(p_{T}\) to the hard collision, but there is no clear prescription concerning the optimal value for this parameter. In view of this difficulty, it seems that only the two other options, (a) and (c), should be considered.

Approach (a) is currently used in the computation of the cross-section for a very similar process, namely the production of \(Ht\bar{t}\) events. Calculations at NLO have been performed recently for this process, with very massive quarks in the final state. Approach (c) is currently applied in the computation of the total \(Z\) production in the collisions of light quarks. The case of b-quarks appears as a difficult problem, since it is not clear a priori which one of these two approaches is more reliable. Approach (a) has been used in the past for b-quarks [1], but recent theoretical work [2] suggests that approach (c) could

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \hline _hard process_ & \(\sigma.Br(BC)\) (pb) & \(\sigma.Br(AC1)\) (pb) & \(\sigma.Br(AC2)\) (pb) \\ \hline (a) \(gg\)\(\to\)\(hbb\) & 0.78\(\cdot 10^{-1}\) & 1.2\(\cdot 10^{-2}\) & 1.6\(\cdot 10^{-3}\) \\ \hline (c) \(bb\)\(\to\)\(h\) & 2.00\(\cdot 10^{-1}\) & 2.8\(\cdot 10^{-2}\) & 2.9\(\cdot 10^{-3}\) \\ \hline _Ratio (c)/(a)_ & 2.6 & 2.5 & 1.8 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Cross-sections before cuts (BC) and after cuts (AC1 for single mode and AC2 for double tag mode)be a reliable approach for b-quarks in the case of \(H\) production, provided the mass of \(H\) is not too small. For small \(H\) masses, NLO QCD corrections become so large, that approach (c) cannot be considered any more a reliable option. In the same way, NLO calculations for approach (a) could be useful to define the validity range of this option.

In addition, the following considerations should also be taken into account. The correct generation of events in approach (c), including NLO corrections, implies the inclusion of \(2\to 2\) processes, where the \(H\) or \(Z\) is produced at high \(p_{T}\). The necessary corrections are already implemented in recent Pythia versions for the \(Z\) case, following the ideas developed in [10]. Since the corrections are still missing in the \(H\) case, they have not been used in the present note 1. In Approach (c) there are also uncertainties related to b-quark PDF's, obtained under the assumption that the b-quark is massless. There are, however, no clear prescriptions at present concerning the validity of massless b-quark PDF's. In view of all this, it seems adequate to consider both options (a) and (c) as valid options in the computation of signal and background events, until a further clarification of the situation is achieved.

Footnote 1: This choice corresponds to the selection of MSTP(68)=2 for both \(Z\) and \(H\).

**Appendix: cross-sections for \(2\to 1\) and \(2\to 2\) processes with \(H\) or \(Z\) in the final state**

The cross-section for a \(2\to 1\) collision of partons \(a\) and \(b\) with invariant centre-of-mass energy \(s\), producing a massive particle of mass \(M\) is in general:

\[\sigma_{ab}=\sigma_{0}\cdot\delta(1-z)\]

where \(z=M^{2}\left/s\right.\). In case of \(b\bar{b}\to H\) or \(b\bar{b}\to Z\) collisions the value of \(\sigma_{0}\) is \(\sigma_{0}=\frac{\pi}{6}\sqrt{2}G_{F}(m/M)^{2}\) and \(\sigma_{0}=\frac{\pi}{6}\sqrt{2}G_{F}\left(1-\frac{4}{3}\,sin^{2}\theta_{w}+ \frac{8}{9}sin^{4}\theta_{w}\right)\) respectively. The parameter \(m\) represents the b-quark mass and other constants are the usual Standard Model parameters.

Cross-sections for \(2\to 2\) collisions with production of a massive boson (\(M\gg m\)) in the final state, can be written in the following way:

\[\sigma_{ab}=z\sigma_{0}C_{ab}\left[P_{ab}(z)Log\left(\frac{M^{2}}{m^{2}}\frac{ \left(1-z\right)^{2}}{z}\right)\right.+f_{ab}(z)\left]\]

where \(C_{ab}\) is a constant, \(P_{ab}(z)\) a splitting function and \(f_{ab}(z)\) a polynom. The detailed values of the functions \(P_{ab}(z)\) and \(f_{ab}(z)\) can be found in references [2] and [7] for \(H\) and \(Z\) production, respectively. The expression of the splitting functions is relevant for the discussion below: \(P_{qq}(z)=(1+z^{2})/(1-z)\) for quark-antiquark collisions and \(P_{qg}(z)=\frac{1}{2}[z^{2}+(1-z)^{2}]\) in quark-gluon case. These cross-sections are divergent if the quarks are assumed to be massless (collinear divergence).

The cross-section in \(pp\) collisions can be obtained by folding the cross-section of the corresponding hard process with the corresponding 'luminosity function' \(L_{ab}\):

\[\sigma(s)=\sum_{ab}\int_{\tau}^{1}\frac{dz}{z}\sigma_{ab}(z)L_{ab}\left(\frac {\tau}{z}\right)\]

where \(s\) is in this case the invariant centre-of-mass energy of the two protons and \(\tau=M^{2}/s\). The luminosity function \(L_{ab}\) is defined in the following way:

\[L_{ab}(\tau)=\int_{\tau}^{1}\frac{dx}{x}F_{a}(x)F_{b}\left(\frac{\tau}{x}\right)\]where \(F_{a}\) and \(F_{b}\) are PDFs for partons \(a\) and \(b\), respectively (with the more convenient definition \(F(x)=xf(x)\), since \(F(x)\) rather than \(f(x)\) values are returned by the available PDF tables).

Due to the singularity of \(P_{qq}(z)\) for \(z=1\), the cross-section is divergent for \(2\to 2\) processes with quark-antiquark in the initial state (this is the infrared singularity, since \(z=1\) corresponds to the emission of a gluon with zero energy). This singularity may be cancelled by adding virtual corrections as in [2] or by imposing a minimum \(p_{T}\) for the hard process as in [6]. For quark-gluon collisions the integral is convergent.
