###### Abstract

This note summarises the expected performance of the ATLAS detector after the upgrades for the High-Luminosity LHC. The performance evaluations are based on full simulation of the upgraded Phase-II detector with in-time and out-of-time pile-up for luminosities up to \(7.5\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) corresponding to an average of number of inelastic collisions per bunch crossing of up to 200.

## 1 Introduction

This note documents several performance studies for the planned ATLAS detector upgrades [1, 2] for the high-luminosity upgrade of LHC (HL-LHC). It is assumed that the center-of-mass energy will be \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV and that the instantaneous luminosity can reach \(L=7.5\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) corresponding to an average of number of inelastic collisions per bunch crossing (pile-up) of up to \(\mu\) = 200. Lower pile-up scenarios are also studied.

Results are reported on the performance of electron identification (Section 3), photon identification and isolation (Section 4), \(b\)-tagging (Section 5), muon reconstruction and trigger (Section 6). Reconstruction of \(B\)-meson decays is discussed in Section 7. Tracking, jet and missing transverse energy performance is described in separate notes [3, 4].

These results have been parameterised with analytic functions that can be used to perform parametric simulation studies modifying the four-momenta of Monte Carlo generated particles to reproduce the detector response. Compared to the previous performance parametrizations reported in Ref. [5] as well as those of the 2015 Scoping Document [2], which are both superseded by the results in this note, the reconstruction software has been updated to take advantage of developments prepared for the current detector, identification criteria have been reoptimized and for some results an improved design of the inner tracker upgrade is used.

## 2 ATLAS Upgrades and Simulation

The current ATLAS detector [6] was designed for an instantaneous luminosity of \(1\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and an average pile-up of 23 collisions per bunch crossing. Recent data-taking has demonstrated that the current detector is able to handle luminosities exceeding this, but to cope with the luminosity expected at the HL-LHC and the radiation damage accumulated during data-taking up to HL-LHC, a major upgrade of the detector is planned. The largest upgrade is the replacement of the inner tracker with a fully silicon-based tracker (ITk) with higher granularity, radiation robustness and an expected coverage2 up to \(|\eta|=4\). The trigger and data-acquisition system will also be upgraded to enable trigger rates up to an order of magnitude larger than the current system, i.e. up to 1 MHz out of the hardware trigger and up to 10 kHz recorded data. This requires replacing almost all of the current readout electronics. In addition the innermost muon barrel layer3 will be upgraded to increase the muon trigger acceptance and robustness. A forward high-granularity timing detector and a very forward muon spectrometer extension are also under consideration.

Footnote 2: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the \(z\)-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\).

Footnote 3: The innermost end-cap layer will be replaced already in the 2019–2020 shutdown by the New Small Wheels [7].

The ATLAS simulation software has been updated to fully simulate two draft designs for the ITk using Geant4 [8], one of which, the so-called _inclined_ design [3], is used for some of the studies presented in this note. The electron, photon and \(b\)-tagging performance has been evaluated on samples simulated with an older design from the Letter-of-Intent [1], denoted \(LoI\), but the studies use improved reconstruction software compared to earlier studies. The _inclined_ design has one more pixel layer than the \(LoI\) designand extends coverage from \(|\eta|=2.7\) to \(|\eta|=4\). In order to accommodate the additional pixel layer, the number of silicon strip layers in the central region has been reduced from five to four. The different tracker designs are embedded in the simulation of the current Run-1 calorimeter and muon spectrometer. The simulation has been used for Monte Carlo samples of single particles and benchmark physics channels, such as \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\), \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) and \(t\bar{t}\). The samples have been merged with a realistic simulation of both in-time and out-of-time pile-up collisions generated with Pythia 8.186 [9]. The number of pile-up collisions per bunch crossing is fluctuated following a Poisson statistical distribution with a mean varying uniformly between 70-90, 130-150 or 190-210 events, denoted \(\langle\mu\rangle=80\), \(\langle\mu\rangle=140\) and \(\langle\mu\rangle=200\), respectively. Both the hard-scatter and pile-up collisions are generated for a Gaussian luminous region centered in the center of the apparatus and distributed along the beam direction with a width of \(\sigma_{z}=5\) cm and transverse widths \(\sigma_{x}=\sigma_{y}=12\)\(\mu\)m.

## 3 Electron Performance

The electron reconstruction and identification performance in ATLAS at the HL-LHC is studied using the LoI ITk design. The improved tracking, the absence of transition radiation measurements, and the increased pile-up require a new optimisation of the electron identification algorithms. A cut-based identification is derived for three working points of electron efficiency, referred to as Loose, Medium, Tight, with increasing rejection of backgrounds. These efficiencies are evaluated for reconstructed electrons passing a set of track-quality requirements. The optimisation procedure follows the approach presented in Ref. [10]. The identification requirements are defined for electrons with \(|\eta|\leq 2.47\) and \(E_{T}>7\) GeV, and vary according to the transverse energy and pseudorapidity of the electron candidate. Three pile-up scenarios are studied: \(\langle\mu\rangle\)=80, 140 and 200. All quoted uncertainties are entirely due to limited Monte-Carlo statistics. The variables used by the identification procedure are as follows:

* Number of hits in the innermost pixel layer.
* Number of hits in the second to innermost pixel layer.
* Number of hits in the pixel detector.
* Number of hits in the silicon detector.
* Transverse impact parameter significance of the track to the beam-spot.
* \(|\Delta\eta|\) between the cluster position in the strip layer and the extrapolated track.
* Ratio of energy in the strip layer to energy in the whole electromagnetic calorimeter.
* Shower width \(\sqrt{(\Sigma E_{i}(i-i_{\rm{max}})^{2})/(\Sigma E_{i})}\), where \(i\) runs over all strips in a window of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\approx 0.0625\times 0.2\) and \(i_{\rm{max}}\) is the index of the highest-energy strip.
* Ratio of the energy difference between the largest and second largest energy deposits in the first layer, divided by their sum.
* Lateral shower width, \(\sqrt{(\Sigma E_{i}\eta_{i}^{2})/(\Sigma E_{i})-((\Sigma E_{i}\eta_{i})/(\Sigma E _{i}))^{2}}\), where the sum is calculated within a window of \(3\times 5\) cells in the second layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter.
* Ratio of the energy in \(\eta\times\phi\) of \(3\times 7\) cells and \(7\times 7\) cells in the second layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter, centred on the energy barycentre.
- Ratio of the energy in \(\eta\times\phi\) of \(3\times 3\) cells and \(3\times 7\) cells in the second layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter, centred on the energy barycentre.
* Ratio of the energy in the back layer to the total energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter.
* Ratio of \(E_{T}\) in the hadronic calorimeter to \(E_{T}\) of the EM cluster (used over the range \(0.8<|\eta|\leq 1.37\)).
* Ratio of \(E_{T}\) in the first layer of the hadronic calorimeter to \(E_{T}\) of the EM cluster (used over the range \(|\eta|\leq 0.8\) and \(|\eta|>1.37\)).

These variables profit from the longitudinal segmentation of the EM calorimeter in three layers, a very granular strip layer, a second layer and a back layer [6].

The efficiency of the electron reconstruction, consisting of the electromagnetic cluster reconstruction, the cluster-track matching, and the track-quality requirements, are evaluated for each pile-up working point. It has been found that the cluster reconstruction efficiency is approximately 0.995, the track matching efficiency is approximately 0.97, and the efficiency of the track-quality requirements is approximately 0.99, irrespective of pile-up.

The main backgrounds to isolated electrons are photon conversions and jets mis-identified as electrons (fakes). The former are primarily rejected using track-based variables, while the later through calorimeter-based variables.

Figure 1(a) shows the various background efficiencies relative to the selected candidates for the three identification working points and for the \(\langle\mu\rangle\)=200 pile-up scenario, while Fig. 1(b) shows the electron identification efficiency for the Medium working point for the three pile-up scenarios. The Medium working point, for pile-up of \(\langle\mu\rangle\)=200 and an average signal efficiency of \(0.836\pm 0.004\) (which amounts to \(0.842\pm 0.007\) if restricted in the \(E_{T}\) range 40-50 GeV), gives an efficiency for conversions of \(0.017\pm 0.006\) and for jets of \((2.9\pm 0.4)\times 10^{-4}\). As a reference, the electron Tight working point used for the analysis of 2015 data (\(\langle\mu\rangle\approx 14\)) had a measured efficiency of 0.85 for signal electrons of 45 GeV, and an efficiency for multijet events of about \((1-2)\times 10^{-3}\)[11]. All identification efficiencies quoted in this comparison are relative to the number of reconstructed candidates.

The fraction of jets from multijet events which cause an electromagnetic cluster to be reconstructed with \(E_{T}\)?7 GeV at \(\langle\mu\rangle\)=200 is \(0.0295\pm 0.0004\). The probability to match a track to one of these clusters, thus causing a reconstructed electron candidate, is \(0.77\pm 0.01\). The fraction of these fake candidates passing the track-quality requirements is \(0.94\pm 0.02\). Lastly, the Tight selection has an efficiency for hadronic fakes (which have passed the track-quality requirements) of \(0.012\pm 0.002\). Multiplying these efficiencies together, gives the probability of a hadron successfully faking a Tight electron as \((2.5\pm 0.4)\times 10^{-4}\).

The energy resolution of electrons is not much affected by pileup energy, except for an increase of the noise term (independent of electron energy). This has an impact only for low energy electrons. Therefore the resolution sampling term and the constant term are roughly the same as the ones measured in Run 1 [12]. It should also be noted that the electron calibration was not re-tuned for these high pileup samples. The calibration extracted for Run 2 samples was used as default. The relative resolution on the electron transverse energy is shown in Figure 2.

The charge mis-identification rate for Medium identified electrons at \(\langle\mu\rangle\)=200, is \((2.6\pm 0.2)\times 10^{-3}\), estimated from a \(Z\to ee\) sample. It is roughly constant with pile-up.

## 4 Photon Performance

The calorimeter-based photon identification and isolation are studied in samples with \(\langle\mu\rangle=200\) and the LoI ITk design.

### Photon Identification

For the photon identification rectangular selection criteria on seven discriminating variables are optimized using a multivariate approach to distinguish well isolated signal photons from background, originating mostly from photon from the decay of neutral mesons in jets. For the signal, photons from a \(H\to\gamma\gamma\)

Figure 1: The efficiency to identify hadrons or photon conversions as electrons estimated using simulated multijet samples is given (a) for the three working points for \(\langle\mu\rangle\)=200, and (b) for the “Medium” working point at the different pile-up scenarios considered in this study. The efficiencies are estimated with respect to electron candidates passing the track-quality requirements. The efficiency (\(\varepsilon_{e^{\pm}}\)) for isolated electrons at each working point is estimated using \(Z\to ee\) decays, while the efficiency for hadrons and conversions fakes are estimated using multijet samples In all cases, \(E_{T}>7\) GeV and \(|\eta|\leq 2.47\) are required, the transition region between the barrel and endcap electromagnetic calorimeters, \(1.37<|\eta|\leq 1.52\), is included, and the reconstructed candidates are matched to their respective generator-level counterparts.

Figure 2: Electron relative transverse energy resolution as a function of the generator-level electron transverse energy (\(\mathrm{E_{T}^{Gen}}\)).

decay produced through the vector boson fusion process are used. The energy spectrum of these photons follows the kinematic of the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) decays, i.e. are mainly in the 60 GeV range. The background photon candidates are obtained from a multijet sample. The variables used for the selection criteria exploiting the calorimeter shower information are similar to the ones used for the electron identification. They are \(E_{\text{Ratio}}\), \(R_{\eta}\), \(R_{\phi}\), \(W_{\eta 2}\), \(R_{\text{had1}}\) and \(w_{\text{stot}}\) as defined in Sec.3. In addition the variable \(\Delta E\), defined as the difference between the energy associated with the second maximum in the strip layer and the energy reconstructed in the strip with the minimal value found between the first and second maxima, is used as well in this case since it is potentially useful to separate clusters generated by single photons from those generated by photon pairs from neutral meson decays.

The identification criteria (the same for unconverted and converted photons) are derived for photon candidates with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV and separately in two intervals in pseudo-rapidity: \(0<|\eta|\leq 1.37\) and \(1.52<|\eta|\leq 2.47\) corresponding to the electromagnetica calorimeter, barrel and end-cap regions (excluding the transition region).

The final set of selection criteria, labeled as "Tight ID", was chosen to get an average signal efficiency of 0.7 and a corresponding probability for a hard-scatter jet to be mis-identified as a photon of at most \(10^{-3}\). Additionally, the probability that a photon passing the Tight ID criteria originates from the additional pile-up activity is estimated to be about \(10^{-4}\), assuming \(\langle\mu\rangle=200\).

### Photon Isolation

To further suppress the contamination of jets mis-identified as a photon, an additional isolation criteria is applied. This also suppresses the selection of real photons generated by parton fragmentation. The calorimeter isolation \(E_{\text{T,topo}}^{R<R_{c}}\) is computed as the sum of transverse energies of positive-energy topological clusters [13] in the calorimeter within a cone of \(R_{c}=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\) centered around the photon candidate. The transverse energy of the photon candidate is removed and the contributions of the underlying event and pile-up are subtracted based on the method suggested in Ref. [14]. The \(E_{\text{T,topo}}^{R<R_{c}}\) variable has been investigated for radii of \(R_{c}=0.4\) and \(R_{c}=0.2\). The distributions are presented for three pile-up scenarios of \(\langle\mu\rangle\)=80, 140 and 200 respectively in Fig. 3.

An isolation cut of \(E_{\text{T,topo}}^{R<0.2}<6\) GeV is applied to all photons regardless of their energy. The efficiency of such isolation requirement as a function of photon \(\eta\) and \(p_{T}\) is presented in Fig.4(a) showing an overall efficiency above 95%. The efficiency is fairly constant in the range of energies relevant for \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) analyses (\(E_{T}^{\gamma}\sim m_{H}/2\)). At high \(E_{T}\) residual contamination from the photon energy into the isolation cone may induce higher inefficiency for a fixed isolation cut. An \(E_{T}\) dependent isolation cut may be introduced in the future to mitigate this effect at high \(E_{T}\).

### Results

The efficiency for a reconstructed photon to pass both the tight identification and isolation criteria is presented in Fig.4(b) as a function of the photon transverse momentum. At 60 GeV the efficiency is about 70%, as expected by construction of the chosen Tight ID working point. For high \(E_{T}\) photons it reaches 87%. As a reference, the efficiency for the Tight ID identification and isolation selection used for the analysis of 2015 data was measured to be about 95% for photons of 60 GeV [15].

The probability that a jet emerging from the hard scatter interaction is reconstructed and mis-identified as a photon (i.e. passing both the Tight ID and isolation criteria) with an \(E_{T}>20\) GeV is estimated from a multijet sample, ignoring photons emerging from final state QED radiation since those are coming from bremsstrahlung and are part of the higher order corrections to prompt proton production, but including genuine photons from hadron decays such as \(\pi^{0}\to\gamma\gamma\). The overall probability is \(2.5\times 10^{-4}\), and its dependence on the generator-level \(p_{T}\) is shown in Fig.5(a). The increase in probability in the lowest part of the spectrum is due to the kinematic limitation of the phase space imposed by the minimal cut on the photon \(p_{T}\) of 20 GeV-- reconstructed photon \(E_{T}\) is lower than the jet \(p_{T}\), typically 75% of the jet \(p_{t}\) with a large resolution effect. The spectrum has been parameterised with a Crystal Ball function.

Similarly, the probability to reconstruct and identify a jet originating from pile-up as a prompt isolated photon is presented as a function of the pile-up jet \(p_{T}\) in Fig.5(b). Unlike for the fakes from the hard

The red line represents the fit with an exponential function.

scatter interaction, the pile-up jets are fully reconstructed and calibrated. Due to the low statistics at higher pile-up jet \(p_{T}\), the fit is performed only in the range below \(100\GeV\) and then extrapolated to higher values. Given the very soft nature of the pile-up jets with a steeply falling \(p_{T}\) spectrum, the pile-up fake rate is driven by the lowest \(p_{T}\) bins where it is very small, therefore the averaged fake rate was estimated to be \(7\times 10^{-5}\).

## 5 \(b\)-tagging Performance Results

The \(b\)-jet identification performance is characterised by the probability to identify a jet containing a \(b\)-hadron as a \(b\)-jet (\(b\)-tagging efficiency) and by the probability to identify a jet not containing a \(b\)-hadron as a \(b\)-jet (mis-tag rate).

The \(b\)-tagging algorithms employed in ATLAS rely on multivariate techniques. The output of these algorithms is a number called the \(b\)-tag weight which discriminates between \(b\)- and non-\(b\)-jets. By selecting the minimum value of the \(b\)-tag weight for jets to be accepted as tagged, one can vary at the same time the \(b\)-tagging efficiency and the mis-tag rate. The chosen cut (labeled by the corresponding average \(b\)-tagging efficiency) is referred to as the tagger operating point.

The results below are quoted for the MV1 tagging algorithm [16] that combines the information from track impact parameter and secondary vertex based algorithms using an artificial neural network. They are evaluated in samples simulated with the ITk LoI design, but no specific retraining was done for the algorithm.

The \(b\)-tagging performance is evaluated using a sample of top quark pair events with at least one top quark decaying semileptonically. Jets are reconstructed as described in Ref. [4]. Only jets that are matched to a parton from the top quark decay are considered in order to evaluate the performance for hard-scatter jets. Those jets are labeled \(b\) or \(c\) or light-flavour based on the presence (or absence) of bottom or charm hadrons within a cone of radius \(\Delta R=0.3\) around the jet axis [17]. Pile-up jets are defined as jets not

matched to any hard-scattering generator-level jet with \(p_{\rm T}>4\) GeV within \(\Delta R=0.6\). These jets are not assigned any particular flavour.

The performance of \(b\)-jet identification is evaluated for two pile-up scenarios (\(\langle\mu\rangle=140\) and \(\langle\mu\rangle=200\)) and two operating points corresponding to average \(b\)-tagging efficiencies \(\langle\varepsilon_{b}\rangle\) of 0.70 and 0.85 evaluated on \(t\bar{t}\) events for \(b\)-jets with \(p_{\rm T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.7\). Fig. 6 shows the light jet rejection (the inverse of mis-tag rate) as a function of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency for the mentioned scenarios. A degradation is observed as the pile-up level increases, but the degradation is much smaller than in earlier studies [2]. For comparison, the best \(b\)-tagging algorithm in Run-2 was optimized to have a light jet rejection [17] of 380 and 33 at 70% and 85%, respectively.

The \(b\)-, \(c\)-, light, and pile-up jet tagging efficiencies are parameterised as functions of jet \(p_{\rm T}\) and \(|\eta|\) for performing parametric simulation studies as described in the introduction. As the statistics of Monte Carlo samples used to derive the efficiencies is limited, two-dimensional fits have been performed and the fit functions are provided to ensure smooth dependencies, as shown in Fig. 7. Closure tests are performed to verify there is good agreement between the fit functions and the actual binned efficiencies.

## 6 Muon Performance Results

### Momentum resolution

The ITk features improved momentum resolution compared to the current ATLAS inner detector. Using simulated single muons traversing the detector, the effect of this improvement on the combined muon momentum resolution can be evaluated. Figure 8 shows the resolution in the central pseudo-rapidity region as a function of the muon traverse momentum, for the "inclined" ITk design.

The ITk dominates the momentum measurement below \(p_{\rm T}=100\) GeV. For muons of \(p_{\rm T}=20\) GeV, a precision of 1% for \(0.1<|\eta|<1.0\) is achieved for the combined muon reconstruction, compared to values of about 2.4% averaged over the full pseudorapidity range for the current ATLAS detector as

operated during the 2015 data-taking [18]. For momenta of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=100\,\mathrm{GeV}\), a precision of \(1.7\%\) for \(0.1<|\eta|<1.0\) improves on the \(3.4\%\) averaged over the full pseudorapidity range for the 2015 ATLAS detector [18]. As the momentum increases, the resolution of the muon spectrometer deteriorates more slowly than the one of the ITk. The cross-over point beyond which the momentum measurement of the muon spectrometer is more precise than the one in the ITk occurs at a value between \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=200-300\) GeV, depending on the pseudorapidity. In this region, both the ITk and the muon spectrometer contribute equally to the measurement, and consequently a significant improvement of the resolution is achieved through the combined fit, with a momentum resolution below \(10\%\) at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=1\,\mathrm{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). Note that the combined fit has not yet been optimised for the Phase-II detector.

### Performance of the Level-0 Barrel RPC trigger with the new inner layer

#### 6.2.1 Introduction

The resistive-plate chambers (RPC) of the ATLAS muon spectrometer are used to provide muon candidates for the trigger system in the barrel (\(|\eta|<1.05\)). The chambers were designed to stand up to a total integrated charge 0.3 \(\mathrm{C}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\), which corresponds to about 10 years of LHC running assuming a detector counting rate of \(100\,\mathrm{Hz}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}\). In order to ensure safe operation of the RPC at the higher particle rates expected at the HL-LHC (up to about \(300\,\mathrm{Hz}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}\)), most chambers will have to be operated at a working point where

Figure 7: The two dimensional parameterizations of (a) the light-flavour mistag rate, (b) the \(b\)-tagging efficiency, (c) the \(c\)-tagging efficiency and (d) the pile-up jet tagging efficiency as functions of jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(|\eta|\) for the \(\langle\varepsilon_{b}\rangle=0.70\) operating point at \(\langle\mu\rangle\)=200.

their performance is degraded with respect to the original design. This is achieved by reducing the gas gain through lowering the operating voltages. In the areas of highest background, the gas gain will have to be reduced to such low levels that hit efficiencies as low as \(\approx 55\%\) could be encountered. To maintain good trigger efficiency, new RPC chambers with increased rate capability will be installed in the barrel inner (BI) layer of the muon spectrometer, see Fig. 9. The installation of these chambers also makes it possible to close most of the acceptance holes of the present barrel muon trigger, which amount to more than \(20\%\) of the \(\eta-\phi\) coverage for \(|\eta|<1.05\)[2].

#### 6.2.2 Trigger scheme including the BI RPCs

The new BI RPC layer is introduced to increase the acceptance of the Level-0 (L0) barrel trigger and to increase its robustness against efficiency losses of the current RPC detectors placed on the barrel middle (BM) and barrel outer (BO) layers of the muon spectrometer. The performance of the RPC barrel trigger has been studied using a MC simulation in which the BI RPC layer is emulated starting from MC-truth hits. The geometrical coverage of the BI RPC chambers has been included in the simulation and is based on a preliminary layout that includes cutouts due to alignment lines, services and other space limitations, and dead regions at the borders of the RPC chambers. Including all these limitations, the geometrical acceptance of the BI RPC layer, calculated with respect to reconstructed muons, is 91%, as shown in Fig. 10(a).

As illustrated in Fig. 9, the Phase-II RPC trigger will use nine measurement planes from four layers: 3

Figure 8: Relative resolution of the \(q/p_{\mathrm{T}}\) measurement for muons with transverse momenta in the range \(5~{}\mathrm{GeV}<p_{\mathrm{T}}<1.3~{}\mathrm{TeV}\), for the “inclined” candidate layout of the ITk. The muons are required to have been reconstructed as combined tracks in the ITk and muon spectrometer. The resolutions of the measurements in the ITk (blue squares), the muon spectrometer (red triangles) and the combined fit (black circles) are shown separately.

planes on the BI muon stations (RPC0), 2 planes in the inner (RPC1) and 2 in the outer (RPC2) side of the BM stations, and 2 planes on the BO stations (RPC3). This makes it possible to define triggers based on different coincidence logics. The following logics have been considered, based on different requirements on the 4 RPC layers.

* **3/3 layers:** hits in at least 3 planes of the RPC1+RPC2 layers and in at least 1 plane of the RPC3 layer. This is equivalent to the present trigger for high-\(p_{T}\) muons;
* **3/4 layers:** the previous requirement in logical or with the requirement of hits in at least 2 planes of the RPC0 layer and in at least 3 planes of RPC1+RPC2+RPC3. In this way all the coincidences in three layers out of four are accepted;
* **3/4 layers + BI-BO:** the previous requirement in logical or with the requirement of at least 2 hits in RPC0 and at least 1 hit in RPC3. This BI-BO coincidence is needed to get the maximum coverage, filling the regions in which both BM layers are missing due to the presence of the barrel toroid coils and their supporting structures. The two-station BI-BO coincidence is expected to suffer from random coincidences from non-correlated backgrounds that are negligible in three-station coincidences. To limit the rate, the BI-BO coincidences can be restricted to the regions with limited acceptance of the BM layer.

Figure 9: Sketch of a transverse section of the barrel region of the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer after the Phase-II upgrade. The four layers of RPC chambers are shown as well as the Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) chambers on the barrel-inner (BI), barrel-middle (BM) and barrel-outer (BO) muon stations. The New Small Wheel (NSW) is also shown. The three dashed lines represent muon trajectories traversing four, two and three layers of RPC chambers. The drawing represents one of the sectors that contain a barrel toroid coil and its support structures which cause the holes in the chamber coverage of the BM layer.

#### 6.2.3 Acceptance and efficiency

The acceptance of the three trigger logics considered above with respect to reconstructed tracks is shown in Fig. 10. The acceptance limitation of the "3/3 layers" trigger, corresponding mostly to the ATLAS support structures at \(-2.2<\phi<-1\) and to the supports of the toroidal magnets (at \(|\eta|\simeq 0.4\), 0.75, 1) are largely recovered by the "3/4 layer" trigger which includes the new BI layer. The residual acceptance holes are recovered with the "3/4 layers + BI-BO" trigger, with the exception of the region at \(|\eta|\simeq 0\) where the acceptance is limited by the calorimeter services. The total acceptance for reconstructed tracks with \(|\eta|<1.05\) increases from 78% with the "3/3 layers" trigger (which represents the acceptance of the present ATLAS Level-1 barrel muon trigger system) to 96% with the "3/4 layers + BI-BO" trigger.

To study the robustness of the trigger against possible efficiency reductions of the current RPCs in the BM and BO layers, simulations with different assumptions on the current RPC detector efficiency have been used. The worst case scenario corresponds to the case in which the high voltage is reduced such that the expected current on the RPC chambers is always below the safe operation limit estimated incuding a safety factor of two. In this scenario the RPC hit efficiency decreases with \(|\eta|\) from approximately 90% at

Figure 10: Acceptance of the L0 Barrel trigger with respect to reconstructed combined muons in the \(\eta\)-\(\phi\) plane. Figure (a) shows the acceptance of the BI layer. Figures (b), (c) and (d) show the acceptance for the different trigger coincidence logics “3/3 layers”, “3/4 layers” and “3/4 layers + BI-BO”, respectively (see text). The white areas correspond to zero acceptance.

\(\eta\simeq 0\) to 56%-75% at \(\eta\simeq 1\), depending on the type of chamber. The product of trigger acceptance times efficiency is presented in Fig. 11 for fully efficient RPCs and for the worst case scenario. Adding the new BI RPC layer, the dependency of the trigger efficiency on the hit efficiency of the current RPCs is strongly reduced, with an overall efficiency \(\times\) acceptance of 92% in the worst scenario.

## 7 B-Physics Performance Results

As a general purpose detector, ATLAS is more than capable of exploiting the large \(b\bar{b}\) pairs production in the \(pp\) collisions at the LHC for precision heavy flavour measurements. The high pile-up environment and relatively low transverse momentum of the produced \(b\)-hadrons confines the ATLAS B-physics programme mostly to exclusive \(b\)-hadron decays, fully reconstructable by the central tracking system, with at least one muon in the final state for an efficient trigger. A significant part of the ATLAS B-physics programme is focused on measurements of rare processes whose precisions, even when using full Run-1 data, are still statistically limited. The next phases of the LHC thus offer opportunities for significant improvements.

The collected number of signal \(b\)-decays critically depends on the trigger strategy. In Run-1, the main B-physics trigger was based on dimuon signatures that required a transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>6\) GeV on one muon candidate and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>4\) GeV on the other (the lowest unprescaled trigger). During Run-2 the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold had to be raised to 6 GeV on both muon candidates and a further increase is expected for HL-LHC. The impact of this scenario on the precision in one of the flagship B-physics analyses -- the CP-violation measurement in \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) decay channel [19] -- was studied in Ref. [20]. However, the scenario predicted in there should be considered rather conservative since a more sophisticated trigger has been introduced in Run-2: a topological L1-trigger [21] allowing for coarse dimuon invariant mass and opening angle selections at L1, followed by a tighter high-level trigger searching for the whole \(B\)-decay tree signature including hadronic charged tracks. While the study in Ref. [20] suggests a possible reduction of signal rate by factor of about 7 if the thresholds would have to be increased from 6 GeV to 11 GeV,

Figure 11: Efficiency \(\times\) acceptance of the L0 Barrel trigger with respect to reconstructed combined muons as a function of \(\eta\), assuming in a) 100% hit efficiency for the current RPCs and in b) the “worst case” hit efficiency scenario in which the RPC HV has been reduced to maintain the chamber currents within a safe limit with a safety factor of two. The red histograms shows the efficiency of the existing “3/3 layers” trigger, the blue one is the “3/4 layers” trigger including the BI layer, while the green part shows the additional gain from the “BI-BO” trigger.

these MC studies of the topological L1-trigger suggest the trigger allows to regain a factor of \(\sim\)3 back (signal yield at the same muon \(p_{\rm T}\) thresholds).

The precision of the ATLAS B-physics measurements is driven by the performance of the tracking system and the muon detectors. It determines the resolution of the invariant mass of reconstructed \(b/c\)-hadrons from their decay products (reconstructed tracks), allowing or disallowing to separate two close states and driving the signal/background ratio. The tracking is also important for the reconstruction of secondary \(b\)-hadron vertices (typically decaying a few mm from the primary \(pp\) collision) in analyses relying on precision measurement of the \(b\)-hadron decay time. Most of the B-physics analyses rely on information about the primary vertex (PV), namely its position and the parameters of the tracks coming from the PV. It is thus crucial to have a robust method for determining the PV where a \(b\)-hadron is produced, which becomes even more important in the high pile-up conditions of HL-LHC. The information is needed for the calculation of the \(b\)-hadrons decay time, for the flavour tagging and for selections using track-based isolation.

The general performance of the upgraded tracking system is discussed in Ref. [3], while this chapter focuses on the performance specific to B-physics analyses. The impact of the performance of the upgraded ATLAS detector and pile-up conditions on the \(b\)-hadron decay time resolution were studied in Ref. [20]. This chapter presents the impact on the \(b\)-hadron mass resolution. The study is based on simulated events containing very rare \(B\)-decay channel \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\), whose branching ration measurement is another flagship B-physics analysis. The study is limited to \(|\eta|<2.5\) as this corresponds to the dimuon trigger acceptance and has the best resolution.

### Monte Carlo Simulation Samples and Event Selection

Monte Carlo events for the decay channel studied are generated using Pythia 8.210. Two run-conditions are simulated: the beginning of Run-2 in 2015 and HL-LHC. The distribution of the number of interactions per bunch-crossing follows the conditions in the Run-2, while for HL-LHC the simulated mean of the number of the interactions \(\langle\mu\rangle\) is 200.

The \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) events are pre-selected similarly as in the Run-1 analysis [22]. The \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidates are reconstructed from oppositely charge muon candidates, each _combined_ of an ID/ITk and a muon spectrometer (MS) track. A two-track vertex fit is performed using the ID/ITk tracks, keeping candidates with \(\chi^{2}/{\rm d.o.f.}<6\) (\({\rm d.o.f.}=1\)). The muon candidates \(p_{\rm T}\) is required to be above \(5.5\) GeV.

The reconstructed \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidates are required to be consistent with the generated signal decays by requiring \(\Delta R<0.1\) between the reconstructed muon candidate tracks and the generated signal muons. No trigger requirements are used.

### Mass Resolution

For the analysis of the rare \(B_{(s/d)}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays, the invariant mass resolution is the key for the separation of the \(B_{d}^{0}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\) states. As demonstrated during the Run-I analysis in Ref. [22], currently the separation ranges from \(1.4\sigma\) (in the barrel \(|\eta|<1.0\) region) to \(0.85\sigma\) (in the far end-cap \(1.5<|\eta|<2.5\)), using the combined MS and ID/ITk tracks. Better mass resolution improves signal to background ratio in general and helps separating contributions from partially reconstructed \(B\)-decays present in the \(B_{(s/d)}^{0}\) candidate mass sidebands.

The comparison of the mass resolution using the ID/ITk-only tracks of the \(B^{0}_{s}\) candidate with Run-2 and HL-LHC detector layouts is shown in Fig. 12. It is visible that the \(B^{0}_{s}\) candidate mass resolution strongly depends on the pseudo-rapidity of the reconstructed \(B^{0}_{s}\). The resolution improves by factor of 1.65 in the barrel region, providing 2.3\(\sigma\) separation for the \(B^{0}_{d}\) and \(B^{0}_{s}\) states. In the far end-cap, the improvement is by a factor of 1.50. However, in this region the MS track resolution contributes to the overall resolution and thus the improvement in the combined MS and ID/ITk tracks will be smaller.

## 8 Summary

The expected performance for the reconstruction and identification of photons, electrons, muons (including the muon barrel trigger), \(b\)-jets as well selected B-physics decay mode have been evaluated using an updated simulation of the proposed ATLAS detector for HL-LHC. Instantaneous luminosities up to \(L=7.5\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) were assumed in the study. At this luminosity, about 200 inelastic \(pp\) interactions per bunch crossing are expected.

The improved HL-LHC detector, together with the improved reconstruction software, result in improved performance compared to previous physics analyses for HL-LHC, and in many cases compared to the current Run-2 detector.

For an electron identification efficiency of 69%, a jet rejection factor of about 4000 is obtained. Also, an electron charge mis-identification of about 0.26% has been evaluated for the first time, which is important for certain physics analyses such as those dedicated to the measurement of same-sign \(WW\) production.

Figure 12: \(B^{0}_{s}\) mass resolution \(\sigma_{\rm mass}(B)\) as a function of the \(B^{0}_{s}\)-meson pseudo-rapidity in the decay channel \(B^{0}_{s}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\), comparing the performance as extracted from MC simulations for Run-2 and HL-LHC. The resolution is defined as RMS of the histograms of difference between the reconstructed and generated invariant masses in the \(\eta(B)\) bin. The figure shows the mass resolution when using ID/ITk track parameters only with the track parameters in the fitted B-vertex.

Photon isolation and identification have been revised in the context of the high pile up environment. At a combined averaged efficiency of 70% for isolated photons, the rejection of fake photons exceed a factor \(\sim\)4000 for jets emerging from the hard scatter interaction and a factor \(\sim\)14000 for jets originating from additional pile up interaction.

\(b\)-tagging algorithms based on multivariate techniques are successfully used already for the analysis of Run-1 and Run-2 data. The expected performance at HL-LHC has been evaluated at two operating points corresponding to average \(b\)-tagging efficiencies of 70% and 85%, respectively. The ITk is able to provide a 30% better rejection of fake \(b\)-tags induced by light-jets at \(\langle\mu\rangle\)=140 with respect to the rejection obtained at Run-2, and at an equivalent level for the challenging pile-up level of \(\langle\mu\rangle\)=200.

The reconstruction of muons with \(p_{T}<200\) GeV greatly benefits from the superior momentum resolution of the ITk inner tracker. Moreover, the installation of a trigger station based on new-generation Resistive Plate Chambers in the innermost station of the muon spectrometer will allow superior coverage and efficiency for the muon trigger of the experiments.

As a result of the improved charged track momentum resolution, the reconstruction and separation of B-hadrons will improve with the new tracker design, with the \(B_{s}^{0}\) mass resolution in the \(B_{s}^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) channel when using ID/ITk-only tracks expected to improve by a factor of about 1.65 in the barrel and about 1.50 in the endcap region.
