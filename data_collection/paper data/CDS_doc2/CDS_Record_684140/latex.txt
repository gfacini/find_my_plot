This note discuss a luminosity monitoring method for the high energy hadron colliders Tevatron and LHC, based on the measurement of the high voltage current of liquid Argon calorimeters.

This method gives a precise relative luminosity measurement, which could be used as an online monitoring.

Ionisation chamber theory with simplified detector models is used in this note to determine the expected current values and to investigate some of the systematic effects which might show up at high luminosity.

Other systematic effects, whose understanding needs more detector-specific studies, are discussed for the ATLAS detectors.

For ATLAS a good candidate detector turned out to be the electromagnetic section of the FCAL.

Design requirements for the high voltage power supply system of this detector are also presented, which would allow to get a 1% precision on the relative luminosity measurement, both from statistics and systematics point of view.

Introduction

The luminosity measurement is an important issue of any collider experiment.

High statistics luminosity measurements with very good understanding of systematic contributions, including theoretical uncertainties, were obtained at LEP, using the small angle Bhabha scattering process.

Unfortunately, no process with such good characteristics exists for \(pp/p\bar{p}\) collisions.

There is now an active debate on the possibility of monitoring with good precision both absolute and relative luminosity at the proton colliders Tevatron and LHC.

This note discuss a relative luminosity measurement, which could also be used as an online monitoring. Relative luminosity monitoring is performed measuring a detector parameter which is proportional to the accelerator luminosity. If this parameter is measured with high statistical precision in a short time, it can be used to get the integrated relative luminosity per run and then to improve, from the statistical point of view, the luminosity determination with absolute methods, which usually suffer from low statistics. This measurement can also be used to detect fast luminosity changes and for beam steering and monitoring. On a long time scale its calibration could be periodically compared with other methods.

The so called _pile-up_ or _minimum-bias_ events, i.e. low \(q^{2}\) interactions, are considered in this note for luminosity monitoring. Their main advantage is the high cross section. However, since no precise absolute cross section can be calculated from theory, only a relative measurement of the luminosity is possible with these events.

The detection technique considered is liquid Argon calorimetry, used at the Tevatron by the D0 Collaboration [1] and at LHC by the ATLAS Collaboration [2].

For simplicity, only the electromagnetic sections of these calorimeters, and in particular those which are located in the end-cap regions, will be considered in this note. Indeed, as will be explained in section 2.1, the low \(p_{T}\) particles of _minimum bias_ events deposit most of their energy there.

These calorimeters have a sampling structure, with liquid Argon as active medium. The absorbers have a different mechanical structure in the three detectors considered: the electromagnetic end-cap calorimeter of D0 (ECEM) is made of flat Uranium absorber plates, that of ATLAS (EMEC) of lead-steel plates bent in accordion shape and the electromagnetic section of the ATLAS forward calorimeter (EFCAL) of a copper matrix with cylindric holes running along the beam axis in which copper rods are inserted to obtain liquid Argon gaps.

The elementary cells of these detectors behave as ionisation chambers. They are connected together to form readout cells and, with a different granularity, high voltage channels.

Figure 1 explains the measurement principle. A charged particle crossing a detector cell, represented by a capacitor of value \(C_{d}\), ionises the liquid Argon. The ionisation electrons and ions drift in the field \(E=V/d\), with V being the potential difference between anode and cathode and \(d\) their distance, and induce a current on the anode, which is measured with a meter located in the power supply box. This current being proportional to the number of incoming particles, is therefore proportional to luminosity.

The resistance R represents the total resistance on the high voltage distribution line, including the series resistance of low-pass filters and of calorimeter electrodes, the lat ter being relevant for EMEC and ECAL. Signal readout, sketched as a triangle in fig 1, is decoupled from the high voltage line by a blocking capacitor \(C_{b}\) either directly integrated in the readout electrodes (D0 and ATLAS EMEC) or as a discrete component (ATLAS EFCAL).

The high voltage current is indeed the only way to measure the energy deposited by _minimum-bias_ events in the calorimeters. Indeed, the rather high energy trigger thresholds of calorimeter sub-systems [2] are such that most of these events are not readout. Moreover, due to bipolar shaping of signals in the front-end, a bare sum of all signals would average to zero.

The time response of high voltage current can be obtained considering that the resistance \(R\), together with the parallel combination of the detector cell and of the blocking capacitor impedance, \(Z_{\parallel}\), form a low-pass filter for the current signal. Detailed calculations and measurements of this quantity are discussed in section 2.3.

In summary, this note investigates the feasibility of the relative luminosity measurement with the high voltage current measurement technique. This method is appealing since it gives an online measurement of the luminosity, with no extra cost involved beyond that of calorimeter construction and without needing any triggering or reconstruction in the detector. Moreover, contrary to methods based on trigger rates, it has no threshold dependence and therefore it does not depend on precise calibration of electronics.

In this note simplified detector models and order of magnitude calculations are almost exclusively used.

The note is organised as follows. In section 2 expected current values are calculated together with their fluctuations. In section 3 possible systematic uncertainties are discussed.

## 2 High voltage currents

### Mean values

To calculate the currents expected in the detectors, inspiration was taken from the multi-particle production model of hadron collisions described in [3], with the input parameters of table 1.

Figure 1: _Measurement principle of the high voltage current in one high voltage channel. \(C_{d}\) is the detector cell capacitance. The triangle represents the signal readout chain._

The model assumes a secondary particle distribution flat in pseudo-rapidity \(\eta\) in the central region and a momentum distribution whose transverse (with respect to beam axis) component \(p_{T}\) is independent of \(\eta\). All the particles are assumed to be pions. Photons from \(\pi^{0}\) decays are taken as abundant as charged particles, with the same \(\eta\) distribution but half the \(p_{T}\). The \(p_{T}\) distributions were approximated by a delta function centred around their mean values.

The detailed mechanical structure of detector absorbers is not relevant for these calculations and was therefore neglected. The detectors were characterised by few fundamental parameters, i.e. the sampling fraction \(f\), the gap size \(d\), the average number of radiation lengths \(N(X_{0})\) and of absorption lengths \(N(\lambda)\) and the acceptance in \(\eta\); the values of these parameters are presented in table 2.

It was assumed that \(\pi^{0}\)'s deposit all the energy in the electro-magnetic calorimeter.

To evaluate the energy deposition of charged pions, a simulation of the D0 calorimeter, based on GEANT package, was performed, using the detector parameters of [1]. The average energy fraction deposited by charged pions in the calorimeter, \(\alpha_{\pi}\), was obtained; the incident charged pion energy was taken as the mean energy \(<E(\bar{p}_{T})>\) of charged pions (of transverse momentum \(\bar{p_{T}}\)) in the angular acceptance. The same quantity \(\alpha_{\pi}\) was also obtained for the other two calorimeters by modifying the detector parameters in the simulation. The obtained values of \(\alpha_{\pi}\) are shown in table 3.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & D0 ECEM & ATLAS EMEC & ATLAS EFCAL \\ \hline \(\eta\) & 1.4-4 & 1.4-3.2 & 3.1-4.9 \\ \(d(mm)\) & 2.3 & 2. & 0.25 \\ \(V(kV)\) & 2.5 & 2.1 & 0.25 \\ \(f\) & 0.12 & 0.2 & 0.015 \\ \(r_{min}(cm)\) & 5.7 & 30 & 10 \\ \(N(X_{0})\) & 20 & 25 & 29 \\ \(N(\lambda)\) & \(1^{*}\) & 2 & 2.6 \\ \(N(ch)_{HV}(\phi)\) & 1 & 32 (128\({}^{**}\)) & 64 \\ \(N(ch)_{HV}(\eta)\) & 1 & 8 & 1 \\ \(V_{Ar}(m^{3})\) & 3.1 & 6.1 & 0.02 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\[P_{R}={\cal L}\sigma\int_{\eta_{1}}^{\eta_{2}}\frac{dN}{d\eta}E(\bar{p_{T}})( \alpha_{\pi}+0.5)d\eta={\cal L}\sigma\frac{dN}{d\eta}\bar{p_{T}}(\alpha_{\pi}+0.5)(\frac{1}{tan\theta_{2}}-\frac{1}{tan\theta_{1}}) \tag{1}\]

with N being the number of charged particles, \(E(\bar{p_{T}})\) the energy of a charged particle of transverse momentum \(\bar{p_{T}}\) at a given \(\eta\), \({\cal L}\) the luminosity and \(\sigma\) the total cross section. The number of ionisation pairs produced per second is

\[N_{pairs}=P_{R}fK(e/\mu)\frac{1}{W} \tag{2}\]

where \(W=25\) eV is energy needed to create a pair in liquid Argon [4], \(f\) is the calorimeter sampling fraction and \(K(e/\mu)=0.7\) the suppression factor for electron response with respect to minimum ionising particle in the sampling medium [2].

In the high voltage field these ionisation pairs give rise to a current [5]

\[I=N_{pairs}e \tag{3}\]

where \(e\) is the electron charge.

The currents expected in the detectors (one end-cap) are shown in table 3. Given the number \(N(ch)_{HV}\) of \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) high voltage cells for the different calorimeters, which are listed in table 2, the current expected in one high voltage channel \(I_{one}\) (for the ATLAS EMEC, the channel of \(\Delta\eta=0.1\) at the smallest \(\eta\) was chosen) were calculated and are shown in table 3.

The effect of the 2 T solenoidal magnetic field, present in the inner region of both experiments, is to sweep away from detectors at radius larger than \(r_{min}\) all particles below \(p_{T}^{min}\), where

\[p_{T}^{min}=0.3B\frac{r_{min}}{2} \tag{4}\]

with B being the magnetic field; a fraction of this particles will go into the calorimeters at larger \(\eta\) and contribute to the ionisation current there (this is the case for the EFCAL). The calculated values of \(p_{T}^{min}\) are shown in table 3. The effect is larger for the ATLAS end-cap calorimeter, though \(p_{T}^{min}\) is always much smaller than \(\bar{p_{T}}\). For simplicity this effect has been neglected in the following.

### Fluctuations

The simpler and cheaper way to measure the high voltage current is using the current meters already present in power supplies for monitoring purposes. I assume that the current measurement will be performed with a digital current meter, with a measurement time much smaller than the detector response time \(\tau\) (see section 2.3) and at a rate much smaller than \(1/\tau\).

A 1% precision will be assumed in the following as a baseline goal for the method.

Two main sources of fluctuations on the measured currents are considered here: the number of particles hitting the detectors, due to both the statistical nature of the process and the LHC bunch structure, and the deposited energy (a \(\delta\) distribution centred around \(\bar{p}_{T}\) was assumed for the calculations of previous section) due to particles in the tails of the \(p_{T}\) distribution.

These fluctuations depend on the time \(\tau^{\prime}\) over which the current is integrated, the smaller \(\tau^{\prime}\) the larger the fluctuations. For both contributions the minimum time constant \(\tau^{\prime}(1\%)\) to have a relative fluctuation \(\sigma(I)/I\) of less than 1% was calculated.

The number of interactions per bunch crossing and the number of final state particles per interaction were assumed to follow a Poisson distribution while the number of particles hitting a specific detector channel the binomial distribution. The bunch structure of LHC was also taken into account [6]. For simplicity the same structure was assumed for the D0 calorimeter. The effect of including the bunch structure is to increase \(\tau^{\prime}\) of about a factor two. The calculated value of \(\tau^{\prime}(1\%)\) is shown in table 3.

The occurrence of very energetic particles in the calorimeter was calculated from perturbative QCD. To do this, QCD jet events were generated with the PYTHIA Monte Carlo program with two different \(p_{T}^{*}\) cuts (the minimum \(p_{T}\) of final state partons) and a simplified detector model, with the parameters of table 2, was used to calculate the expected currents. Table 4 reports the total cross section for these events, the current induced by these events in one end-cap and the \(\tau^{\prime}(1\%)\) value, for both EMEC and EFCAL.

It can be noticed that the fluctuation on the number of particles is by far the dominant effect.

Once the high voltage system granularity is frozen, there are two ways to reduce the r.m.s. of measured currents: averaging the measurements on a group of channels and increase the series resistance of the low-pass filter on the high voltage line.

The former is only viable for EMEC and EFCAL. As an example summing up the currents of channels with the same \(\phi\) (the whole calorimeter for EFCAL) would reduce the noise by a factor \(\sqrt{N(ch)_{HV}(\phi)}=8\). The latter has a limitation coming from signal loading. Indeed, the current I flowing across resistance R would lead to a voltage drop in the detector as \(V_{drop}=IR\). The two ATLAS calorimeters use a fast readout, with the signal being proportional to \(V^{0.3}\)[7]. If a given stability \(a\) of the response is required, this implies:

\[R<3\frac{V}{I}a \tag{5}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & D0 ECEM & ATLAS EMEC & ATLAS EFCAL \\ \hline \(<E(\bar{p}_{T})>\) (GeV) & 2.9 & 2.5 & 12.4 \\ \(\alpha_{\pi}\) & 0.36 & 0.44 & 0.34 \\ \(p_{T}^{min}\) (MeV/c) & 17 & 90 & 30 \\ \hline \(I(\mbox{mA})\) - High (Low) \({\cal L}\) & 1.6 (0.3) & 37 (3.7) & 8.2 (0.8) \\ \(I_{one}(\mu A)\) - Low \({\cal L}\) & 320 & 2.4 & 13 \\ \(\tau^{\prime}(1\%)(ms)\) - Low \({\cal L}\) & 3.0\({}^{*}\) & 3.6\({}^{*}\) & 0.84\({}^{*}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Requiring \(a<0.001\) implies at high luminosity \(R<25\)\(K\Omega\). For EFCAL, where only hadronic showers are measured, requiring \(a<0.01\) implies that \(R\) should be less than 30 \(K\Omega\). For ECAL the effect is discussed in [8].

### Determination of the detector response time

#### 2.3.1 Emec

The time constant \(\tau\) was measured during a beam test of a prototype module of the barrel liquid Argon calorimeter(the so called _2m_ prototype [2]) in 1997. The size of the active detector area was \(\Delta\eta=0.7\) and \(\Delta\Phi=0.2\). The test was performed on the H6 beam line at CERN North Area with a 200 GeV electron beam. The trigger was made of the coincidence of two scintillators located along the beam line. The integrated number of incoming particles was registered by a scaler which was reset at the end of each SPS burst. High voltage was fed to the calorimeter with only one power supply channel [9], with eight high voltage sectors connected in parallel. A low-pass RC filter was present on the high voltage line on each sector, with \(R=1\)\(M\Omega\) and \(C=10\)\(nF\). The current was measured by the analog current meter of the power supply, with sensitivity 10mV/\(\mu A\), amplified with a high frequency broadband amplifier and digitised with a charge integrating ADC. The calibration of the current meter readout chain was carefully checked. In a subsequent test, the calibration of an identical current meter was checked over a wide current range and found to be correct within a few percent. Scaler and current readout was performed together with calorimeter signal readout, at about 200Hz rate.

Figure 2(bottom) shows, for one SPS burst, the number of incoming particles versus time. The open dots correspond to out-of-burst readout triggered by a clock. It can be noticed that the number of incoming particles versus time was almost constant during the burst.

Figure 2(top) shows, for the same SPS burst, the measured current. Unfortunately readout was such that data were not taken after the end of burst. In the collected data sample, only one shorter burst was found, shown in figure 3, from which it was possible to observe also current decay after the end of burst.

A parametrisation of the observed behaviour was obtained using the electric analogue

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & EMEC & EFCAL & EMEC & EFCAL \\ \(p_{T}^{*}>\) & 20 & 20 & 50 & 50 \\ \hline \(\sigma\) (mb) & 0.6 & 0.6 & 0.02 & 0.02 \\ \(I\)(mA) - High \(\mathcal{L}\) & 0.84 & 0.18 & 0.05 & 0.007 \\ \(\tau^{\prime}(1\%)(\mu s)\) - Low \(\mathcal{L}\) & 6 & \(\ll 1\) & 50 & \(\ll 1\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The numbers (except for cross section) correspond to one end-cap region of the ATLAS detector_of the transient response of an RC circuit with a constant current source (the electron beam in our case) when closing (\(f(t)\)) or opening (\(g(t)\)) a switch, with:

\[f(t)=I\cdot(1-exp(-\frac{t-t_{0}}{\tau}))\ \ \ \ \ and\ \ \ \ \ g(t)=I\cdot exp(-\frac{t-t_{0}}{\tau}) \tag{6}\]

with \(t_{0}\) being the start-of-burst time. The dotted curves superimposed to figures 2 and 3 are the above functions with \(\tau=0.47\) sec.

A cross check of the absolute calibration of the current measurement was performed as follows. The expected current (at large time \(t-t_{0}\) in formula (6)) is:

\[I=R_{inc}pE_{beam}\frac{1}{W}efK \tag{7}\]

with \(E_{beam}\) being the beam energy, \(R_{inc}\) the rate of incident particles, \(p\) the purity of the electron beam, estimated around 80% from energy spectra in the calorimeter (though beam composition is not know for particles outside scintillator acceptance) and \(f=0.2\) the sampling fraction. It was obtained \(I=0.7\)\(\mu A\), in fair agreement with the value obtained from the current meter. The trigger efficiency, not studied, was not included in the above calculation.

Figure 2: _Measured current on the high voltage line of a prototype of the ATLAS barrel accordion calorimeter (top) and number of incoming particles (bottom) vs. time during an SPS burst with a 200 GeV electron beam._

The detailed electric scheme of this detector is very complex, due to the large number of resistors and capacitors necessary to correctly describe the readout electrodes and therefore a calculation with SPICE was not performed.

The quite long response time observed in the experiment could be due to either the resistor in the high voltage filter or the electrodes or both. It was verified on a test bench that the power supply can not be responsible for this long response time. Indeed, with the detector replaced by an RC circuit with \(C=10\)\(\mu F\), the measured time response of the current meter with the same power supply can be made as small as 10 ms (with \(R=100\Omega\)).

Assuming conservatively that \(\tau\) scales down with R, if R=\(30K\Omega\), a lower limit of 16 ms can be derived and this satisfies the requirements of section 2.2.

The measured noise from pedestal width was 8nA while at maximum current was 10nA. This can be explained from the contribution due to the statistical fluctuations on the incoming particle rate, which is is 1.6%, i.e. 8.3nA. The electronic noise from the current meter could be reduced with a low pass filter on the readout with time constant up to \(0.1\tau\).

Figure 3: _Measured current on the high voltage line of a prototype of the ATLAS barrel accordion calorimeter (top) and number of incoming particles (bottom) vs. time during an SPS burst with a 200 GeV electron beam. It is a different burst from figure 2._

#### 2.3.2 Efcal

For EFCAL no direct measurement was performed so far.

A calculation was performed with the SPICE program, considering the response of the RC circuit formed by the detector cells and the series resistance of the filter on the high voltage line. The number of elementary cells connected in parallel per high voltage channel is given by the total number of elementary cells in the detector (12000) divided by the number of high voltage channels \(N(ch)_{HV}\) (see table 2). The capacitance seen by one high voltage channel is therefore 70 nF. With 30 \(K\Omega\) series resistance of the low-pass filter, \(\tau\) is 2.5 ms, satisfying the requirements of section 2.2.

## 3 Systematic effects

Many possible sources of systematic effects have to be considered.

Even without colliding beams, some current is expected from natural material radioactivity and electrode leakage. However this current can be considered almost constant and can be measured at beam off and subtracted from that measured with beam on.

More of concern are effects which show up only during collisions and could be rate dependent, such as detector activation [2], space charge formation in liquid Argon, acceptance effects due possible displacements of the mean interaction point along beam axis and temperature variations. Eventually effects connected with possible beam backgrounds, due e.g. to muons from beam halo, have also to be considered [10].

### Recombination

Ionisation electrons and ions might recombine yielding less current per number of incident particles than expected and the current loss could be rate dependent. The problem can be divided in two parts: initial (sometimes also called columnar) recombination [11], i.e. along the primary ionisation track, and recombination during drift.

Recombination along the primary ionisation track, at the electric fields of the three detectors discussed here (about 10 KV/cm), is 5% for electrons and 90% for alpha particles. In the literature measurements are reported [12] showing that initial recombination is sensitive to liquid Argon pollution from hydrocarbon-like impurities. There is no information on the effect of electro-negative impurities. In any case any variation of the impurity content would take place on long-time scales and therefore could be compensated for by periodical calibrations with other luminosity monitoring methods, as discussed in section 1.

Recombination during drift can take place in the presence of a large positive space charge density, due to the combined effect of high flux and slow motion of positive ions with respect to electrons in liquid Argon.

The loss of current due to recombination of charge carriers along the drift path is [5],

\[\left(\frac{\Delta I}{I}\right)_{rec}=\beta_{e}\frac{nd^{2}}{w^{+}w^{-}_{e}} \equiv f(\eta) \tag{8}\]

with \(0\leq f(\eta)\leq 1\), \(w^{+}=\mu^{+}E\), where \(\mu^{+}=0.15\)\(mm^{2}/Vsec\)[13], \(w^{-}_{e}=0.5cm/\mu sec\) at E=10 KV/cm and \(\beta_{e}=10^{-4}\)\(cm^{3}/sec/pair\)[14] (for comparison, its value for gaseousArgon is \(10^{-10}\ cm^{3}/sec/pair\)[5, 15]).

Recombination is indeed a possible source of non-linearity in the luminosity measurement because:

1. \(n\), the ionisation density, is proportional to luminosity
2. the electron and ion drift velocities depend on the external electric field which might be screened by space charge in a luminosity dependent way

In the following it will be shown that, for the three calorimeters considered here, at maximum \(n\), the external field is not screened by space charge and therefore the drift velocities can be assumed constant in the above formula.

Eventually the presence of electro-negative impurities will be considered.

#### 3.1.1 Calculation of the ionisation density

To calculate the maximum ionisation rate density expected for the three detectors a simplified detector model was used [16].

The calorimeter was modelled with only one gap of thickness \(d\), located at electromagnetic shower maximum and perpendicular to the incident particle direction \(\hat{s}\). The energy deposited by the shower \(E_{dep}\) versus calorimeter depth in radiation lengths \(t=x/X_{0}^{abs}\), where \(x\) is the calorimeter depth in units of density and \(X_{o}^{abs}\) the absorber radiation length in units of density, was assumed to be a triangle (rather than a Gamma function, as is usually assumed in textbooks); at shower maximum then

\[\frac{dE_{dep}^{max}}{dt}(\bar{p_{T}})=\frac{2}{N(X_{0})}E(\bar{p_{T}}) \tag{9}\]

and the energy loss per unit gap depth is

\[\frac{dE_{dep}^{max}}{ds}(\bar{p_{T}})=\frac{2}{N(X_{0})}E(\bar{p_{T}})K(e/ \mu)\frac{\rho_{abs}}{\rho_{Ar}X_{o}^{abs}}\frac{(dE/dx)_{Ar}}{(dE/dx)_{abs}} \tag{10}\]

where \(\rho_{Ar}\) is the liquid Argon density, \(\rho_{abs}\) the absorber density, \((dE/dx)_{Ar}\) the specific energy loss of a m.i.p. in the liquid Argon and \((dE/dx)_{abs}\) the specific energy loss of a m.i.p. in the absorber.

The contribution from incident charged hadrons at electro-magnetic shower maximum was conservatively taken as 50% as that of the total deposited energy, since the hadronic showers have a more uniform longitudinal energy deposition profile in the electromagnetic calorimeter.

The ionisation rate density in the gap is given by:

\[n(r)=\frac{1}{W}\Phi(r)\frac{dE_{dep}^{max}(\bar{p_{T}})}{ds} \tag{11}\]

where \(\Phi\) is the incident photon flux, and is, at radius \(r\) from the beam axis:

\[\Phi(r)={\cal L}\sigma\frac{dN}{d\eta}\frac{1}{4\pi\ r^{2}} \tag{12}\]

The values of the maximum ionisation rate density at the innermost detector radius \(n(r_{min})\) are presented in table 5(a).

#### 3.1.2 Screening of external field

A prototype module of the barrel electro-magnetic calorimeter was exposed in 1996 to a high intensity 200 GeV electron beam at CERN H8 beam line in order to see the effect of space charge on detector response. The results are reported in [2] and indicate that the measured energy in the calorimeter decreases by \(1.5\%\) with an energy flux of \(5\cdot 10^{6}GeV/cm^{2}s\) and with the external high voltage field at nominal value.

From these results and using the model of [17] it is possible to get information on electric field distortions induced by space charge. In this model the effect of space charge on calorimeter response was found to scale as a function of a single variable \(\alpha\):

\[\alpha=\frac{d^{2}}{V}\sqrt{\frac{ne}{\epsilon\mu^{+}}} \tag{13}\]

where \(\epsilon=1.5\epsilon_{o}\) is the absolute dielectric constant of liquid Argon. The ionisation rate density \(n\) expected at shower maximum for the barrel accordion calorimeter was calculated as in section 3.1.1. For an energy flux of \(5\cdot 10^{6}GeV/cm^{2}s\) then \(\alpha=0.7\). In the model of [17], this value of \(\alpha\) would correspond to a field at the anode, where field screening is maximal, of about \(90\%\) of the nominal one. For the D0 calorimeter \(\alpha\) is found to be \(0.8\), with a field at the anode of \(85\%\) of the nominal one.

The rate density at which the external field is completely screened at the anode, the _critical rate density_\(n_{c}\), is obtained when \(\alpha=2\). The values are shown in table 5(b). It should be mentioned that some disagreement exists among different measurements of \(\mu^{+}\), as discussed in [13].

It is seen that for the three calorimeters, at high luminosity, the ionisation density is smaller than critical density, at the minimum detector radius.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & D0 & D0 & ATLAS & ATLAS & ATLAS & ATLAS \\  & ECAL & ECAL & EMEC & EMEC & EFCAL & EFCAL \\  & (Low \(\mathcal{L}\)) & (High \(\mathcal{L}\)) & (Low \(\mathcal{L}\)) & (High \(\mathcal{L}\)) & (Low \(\mathcal{L}\)) & (High \(\mathcal{L}\)) \\ \hline (a) & 0.7 & 3.5 & 0.2 & 1.4 & 3.1 & 31 \\ (b) & 11 & 11 & 14 & 14 & 796 & 796 \\ (c) & 1.7 & 8.8 & 0.5 & 4.6 & 14.6 & 146 \\ \hline (d) & 7 & 35 & 1.1 & 11 & 0.43 & 4.3 \\ (e) & 0.8 & 4.1 & 0.2 & 1.9 & 0.1 & 1 \\ (f) & 0.13 & 0.13 & 0.15 & 0.15 & 1.1 & 1.1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 3.1.3 Results

Given the steep radial dependence of ionisation density, the effect of recombination on the measured current is obtained when formula (8) is weighted on the actual particle flux, i.e:

\[\overline{\Delta I/I}=\frac{\int(\Delta I/I)\Phi(r)r^{2}dr}{\int\Phi(r)r^{2}dr} \tag{14}\]

Table 5 shows the current losses at the innermost detector radius \(r_{min}\) (d) and (e) averaged over detector acceptance. The effect is more relevant for the D0 calorimeter where at high luminosity is around 4%. For EMEC the average effect on all channels is shown. However, since this calorimeter has a radial segmentation, the intensity of recombination effect is expected to be different from channel to channel.

#### 3.1.4 Effect of attachment on electro-negative impurities

In the presence of electro-negative impurities, a certain fraction of drifting electrons gets attached [18] on impurities and there is a net current loss. To estimate the intensity of this effect, in formula (8) the electron drift velocity \(w_{e}^{-}\) should be replaced by the negative ion velocity \(w_{ions}^{-}\) (assumed equal to that of positive ions) and \(\beta_{e}\) be replaced by \(\beta_{ions}\):

\[\left(\frac{\Delta I}{I}\right)_{rec}=\beta_{ions}\frac{nd^{2}}{w^{+}w_{ions}^ {-}}\equiv g(\eta) \tag{15}\]

with \(0\leq g(\eta)\leq 1\). Unfortunately, the value of \(\beta_{ions}\) is not known for liquid Argon (for gaseous Argon is \(\beta_{ions}^{gas}=10^{4}\cdot\beta_{e}^{gas}\)[5, 15]). If \(\gamma\) is the fraction of attached electrons, then

\[\overline{\left(\frac{\Delta I}{I}\right)_{rec}}=\overline{f(\eta)}(1-\gamma )+\overline{g(\eta)}\gamma \tag{16}\]

where the average is calculated as in formula (14). Assuming conservatively \(g(\eta)=1\), if we require to keep the contribution to the current loss due to attachment below 1%, we need \(\gamma<1\%\). The attenuation due to attachment was parametrised with an exponential function of the drift distance, with mean free path \(\lambda(cm)=(0.14\pm 0.03)E/\rho\), with \(\rho\) being the pollution content in p.p.m. and E the electric field in kV/cm [2]. The fraction of attached electrons \(\gamma\), assuming on average the electrons to travel a distance \(d/2\), is

\[\gamma=1-exp(-\frac{d}{2\lambda}) \tag{17}\]

The maximum impurity content allowed is given in table 5 (f). It is seen that the values are in the range of sensitivity of the purity probes foreseen for the ATLAS cryostats.

### Other effects (calculated only for the ATLAS detectors)

#### 3.2.1 Detector activation

Primary and secondary radiation (mainly neutrons produced in hadronic showers) can activate the detectors. Radiation from activated materials ionises the liquid Argon and contributes to the current.

Material activation for the ATLAS calorimeters at high luminosity was calculated usingthe FLUKA program [2, 19]. The different produced isotopes were made to decay according to [20] and the energy deposition in the calorimeters was calculated with GEANT.

The activities \(A\) of the isotopes contributing the most to liquid Argon currents \(I\) are summarised in table 6. The currents turn out to be much smaller than those due to primary interactions and can be measured when the beam is turned off, given the quite a long life-time of concerned isotopes.

#### 3.2.2 Temperature variations

Temperature variations might come from convective thermal motions in the cryostats (that are independent of luminosity and therefore can be measured with temperature probes when beam is off), from power dissipation by Joule effect in liquid Argon and from energy deposition of particles coming from the interaction point.

A temperature variation of liquid Argon would affect the current through a density change by \(0.5\%/^{o}K\)[2]. Calculations for both EMEC and EFCAL indicated \(\Delta T<0.3-0.4^{o}K\)[16, 21].

#### 3.2.3 Displacements of the mean interaction point

Current variations in one end-cap detector corresponding to 1 cm displacement of the average interaction point along beam axis are of 0.3%/cm for EMEC and 0.2%/cm for the EFCAL. When the currents of the two end-cap detectors are summed, the variation is reduced to less than 0.1%/cm.

#### 3.2.4 Beam losses

Beam losses are a potentially important source of background in LHC experiments. For this reason appropriate shieldings are being built. As an example, in [10] it was shown that the proposed CMS shielding is very effective in shielding from electrons and hadrons. However, high energy muons penetrate through the shielding and deposit energy in the detector.

Using the MARS code [22], full simulation of cascades initiated by protons lost in the region between 23 m and 1000 m from the interaction point was performed, together with low-energy neutrons, electro-magnetic shower, muon production and transport. A beam current of 530 mA per beam at nominal luminosity was assumed, with 500 interactions/m/s in warm and cold straight sections and \(10^{4}\) interactions/m/s in cold arcs. A shielding structure, as proposed in 1995 for the CMS detector, was used,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & A(GBq) EMEC & I (\(\mu A\)) & A(GBq) EFCAL & I (\(\mu A\)) \\ \hline \({}^{41}Ar\) & 49 & 131 & 0.55 & 0.5 \\ \({}^{64}Cu\) & 15 & 3 & 240 & 2.5 \\ \({}^{66}Cu\) & \(<0.01\) & \(<0.01\) & 60 & 0.35 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: _Activities \(A\) of the materials contributing the most to liquid Argon current \(I\), after 1 year of LHC running at nominal (high) luminosity_assuming that a similar shield will be installed for ATLAS. The produced muons were tracked to the ATLAS detector [23], taking into account the effect of the toroidal magnetic field and the deposited energy in the calorimeters was calculated, using the PDG parametrisation of energy loss for muons. The induced liquid Argon currents are 6 nA for EMEC and 0.06 nA for EFCAL and therefore negligible for the luminosity measurement.

## 4 Requirements for the high voltage power supply system of ATLAS

To measure the relative luminosity at 1% level the high voltage supply system must be accordingly designed. To define the requirements for the high voltage system for the ATLAS detector, the EFCAL calorimeter is considered here.

Table 7 shows the requirements for the high voltage system when 1% precision on the relative luminosity is asked both from single channel measurement and from the sum of the 128 channels at low \(\mathcal{L}\): the sensitivity on the measured current \(\Delta I\), the maximum \(R_{HV}^{max}\) and the minimum \(R_{HV}^{min}\) resistance value for the series resistor on the high voltage line. The absolute precision on I is not important since the relative luminosity is defined up to a scale factor. The relative precision around the nominal current value \(\Delta I/I\) is important, i.e. nonlinearities must be kept below 1%. In any case, to be safe, a calibration curve for the chosen power supply can be easily obtained comparing the current measurements of the power supply with an external current meter set on the high voltage line, with different load resistors.

One possible futher source of noise could come from the current readout electronics, before digitisation: its bandwidth could be reduced by an appropriate shaping network, depending on the rate at which the current need to be read.

The minimum dynamic range \(r\) of the ADC is given by:

\[r=\frac{I_{one}(High\mathcal{L})}{\Delta I}\times sf \tag{18}\]

where \(sf\) is a safety factor of 5, and the minimum number of bits \(n_{bits}\) is calculated.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & Single HV channel & All channels \\ \hline \(\Delta I(\mu A)<\) & 0.13 & 1.4 \\ \(\Delta I/I<\) & 0.01 & 0.01 \\ \(R_{HV}^{max}(k\Omega)<\) & 30 & 30 \\ \(R_{HV}^{min}(k\Omega)>\) & 12 & 1 \\ \(n_{bits}>\) & 13 & 9 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 7: _Requirements for the HV supply system: a relative luminosity measurement with 1% precision from one channel of EFCAL and from all channels summed together was required. The requirement on the noise of the current readout chain is not shown but should be kept in mind_Conclusions

This note discuss a method of online relative luminosity monitoring for the high energy hadron colliders Tevatron and LHC.

The proposed method is the readout of the high voltage current of liquid Argon calorimeters.

For ATLAS a good candidate detector turned out to be the electromagnetic section of the FCAL.

Design requirements for the high voltage power supply system of this detector were also presented, which would allow to get a 1% precision on the relative luminosity measurement, both from statistics and systematics point of view.
