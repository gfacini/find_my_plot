The expected performance of the ATLAS detector at the LHC is summarized. Emphasis is given on specific discovery channels which lead to final states containing high energy muons.

## 1 **Introduction**

The ATLAS [1] detector is by design a general purpose detector which will operate at the new CERN's proton-proton collider, the LHC[2] at centre-of-mass-energies of \(\sqrt{s}=\)14 TeV from 2007 onwards.

The open design permits measurement and identification of leptons, photons up to rapidities \(|\eta|<2.5\) and jets up to rapidities \(|\eta|<5\). This allows the exploitation of a wide range of physics signatures. Emphasis is given to the discovery of the Higgs particles predicted by the Standard Model (SM) or by models beyond it, to the discovery of new expected or unexpected particles, as well as to the performance of precision electro-weak measurements.

The initial luminosity is expected to be \(10^{33}\) cm-\({}^{2}\)sec-\({}^{1}\) corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) per year and will rise after 3 years to \(10^{34}\) cm-\({}^{2}\)sec-\({}^{1}\) corresponding to 100 fb-\({}^{1}\) per year respectively. The rate of events expected in one second and one year correspondingly at low luminosity is given in Table 1.

This report gives a brief and "biased" account of the potential of specific physics channels. Most of the topics refer to decay channels where one or more high energy muons are produced. This bias is partially due to the fact that the Greek-ATLAS collaboration has undertaken a heavy commitment in the building of the Muon Spectrometer and is currently constructing 10% of the muon precision chambers (MDT's). A full detailed discussion of all the physics topics is given in the ATLAS Detector and Physics Performance Technical Design Report [3].

## 2 QCD physics

The high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) events at the LHC are dominated by QCD jet production. The study of ultra high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) events is very interesting because it covers an unexploited kinematic region. On the other hand, the abundant production of QCD events creates a strong background for the new particle discovery channels: for instance, the rate of jets with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\)\(>\) 700 GeV is five orders of magnitude higher than the rate of jets from a Higgs boson of 150 GeV.

Nevertheless, the study of high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) jets, of single photon events and of the W and Z bosons as well as, of Drell-an lepton pairs, will permit the extraction of the quark and gluon densities of the proton down to very low Bjorken-x's ( about 3*10\({}^{4}\)\(<\) x \(<\) 10\({}^{-1}\) for Q\({}^{2}\)\(\sim\)10\({}^{3}\) GeV\({}^{2}\)). Through these channels a measurement of the strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}\) up to the highest scales of order TeV, may also be possible.

## 3 Electroweak precision measurements

The high production rate of particles such as the W, Z bosons (as shown in Table 1), will permit the performance of precision measurements with high statistics samples. In most cases, the statistical errors will be negligible and the measurements will be dominated by the systematic uncertainties.

The main sources of uncertainties are:

a) the lepton energy scale

b) the jet energy scale which influences the top mass determination

c) uncertainties in the theory

Concerning the first topic, studies have shown that it can be determined _in situ_ using the Z\(\rightarrow\)l\({}^{+}\)l decays, with a precision of 0.1%. As an example, we refer to the calibration of the muon mass scale using a sample of only 10K Z\(\rightarrow\)

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c c c|} \hline Process & \(\sigma\) (pb) & Events per second & Events per year \\  & & at 10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{2}\)sec\({}^{-1}\) & at 10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)sec\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline \(W\to e\nu\) & 1.5 *10\({}^{4}\) & 15 & 10\({}^{8}\) \\ Z \(\to e^{+}e^{-}\) & 1.5 *10\({}^{3}\) & 1.5 & 10\({}^{7}\) \\ \(\vec{\mu}\) & 800 & 0.8 & 10\({}^{7}\) \\ \(b\overline{b}\) & 5 *10\({}^{8}\) & 5x10\({}^{5}\) & 10\({}^{12}\) \\ \(\widetilde{gg}\) (\(m_{\widetilde{g}}\) = 1\(TeV\)) & 1 & 10\({}^{-3}\) & 10\({}^{4}\) \\ H (m\({}_{\mathrm{H}}\)=700 GeV) & 1 & 10\({}^{-3}\) & 10\({}^{4}\) \\ Inclusive jets & \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\)\(>\)200 GeV & 10\({}^{5}\) & 10\({}^{2}\) & 10\({}^{9}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: For the physics channels listed in the first column, the cross-sections and the expected number of events in one second and in one year at low luminosity Assuming that the alignment of the muon spectrometer is perfect, that the magnetic field is measured using the information of about 5,000 Hall probes, then it is shown that the energy loss in the barrel calorimeters can be retrieved with a precision of 45 MeV and at the same time, the scale factors of the magnetic field can be fine tuned so as to reconstruct the Z mass (Fig.1) with an accuracy of better than 0.1%.

The lepton energy calibration using the Z decays offers the extra advantages that the leptons are close in energy to the ones produced by both the Higgs and the W bosons decays. In order to reconstruct the W mass with an accuracy of better than 20 MeV, one has to determine the lepton mass scale with a precision of 0.02%, which represents a serious experimental challenge.

Another precision study is the study of the Triple-Gauge-Couplings (TGC's) which provides a direct test of the non-abelian structure of the SM. The couplings of the type WW\(\gamma\) or WW\(Z\) can be described by four independent parameters k\({}_{Z}\), k\(\gamma\), \(\lambda_{Z},\lambda\gamma\).

If the values of these parameters deviate from their SM prediction ( 0 for the \(\lambda\)'s and 1 for the k's) then the anomalous couplings would imply the presence of new physics. Fig.2 shows how the presence of anomalous couplings will change the shape of the reconstructed \(\mbox{p}_{\mbox{\tiny T}}^{\gamma}\) and \(|\eta\)*\({}_{\mbox{\tiny T}}|\) distributions of the photons from the W\(\gamma\) production. The final LEP accuracy, from the deviations of the couplings from their SM values, is about 1%. At the LHC with full luminosity after 3 years of operation, one hopes to improve the accuracy in at least the \(\lambda\)-type couplings- this contribution is enhanced at high centre of mass energies - to 0.1%.

Figure 1: Reconstructed dimuon mass using the calibration method described in reference [4].

Another recent study concerns the so called "neutral" TGC's namely production of the \(ZZZ\), \(ZZ\)\(\gamma\), \(Z\gamma\gamma\) vertices. Again the anomalous couplings are expected to produce a high \(\rm p_{T}\) tail in the \(\rm p_{T}\)\({}^{\gamma}\), \(\rm p_{T}\)\({}^{Z}\) distributions. The effects of the NLO corrections increase the high tail of the distributions tending to reduce the sensitivity to the neutral TGC's but a jet veto cut restores the cross-section to its Born-level shape. The LEP limits are at the level of 10% whereas the ATLAS measurements are expected to be accurate at the level of 10\({}^{\rm 4}\)-10\({}^{\rm 6}\), almost sensitive to radiative corrections and contributions from the supersymmetric models.

## 4 Top quark physics

The top mass determination at the LHC will benefit from the very large statistics, due to the large \(t\bar{t}\) pair production cross-section. Studies have shown that three different channels can be used for the top mass determination: the semi-leptonic decay \(t\bar{t}\to WbW\bar{b}\to(jjb)(l\bar{\psi})\), the fully leptonic \(t\bar{t}\to(l\nu\bar{\nu})(l\bar{\psi})\) and the fully hadronic one \(t\bar{t}\to(jjb)(jj\bar{b})\). They all have different systematic uncertainties on the top mass. The semi-leptonic channel is considered as the "gold-plated" one for the mass determination. The lepton is used for triggering and the top mass is determined from the hadronic part of the decay (jjb). An uncertainty of 1% in the absolute jet scale which is determined _in situ_ from the W\(\to\)jj decays gives an uncertainty on the top mass of 1 GeV. The uncertainty which then dominates, is the uncertainty on the final state gluon radiation. The overall accuracy after a year of running, at low luminosities, by combining all the above methods should be of the order of \(\sim\)1 GeV.

Moreover, the cross-section for the \(t\bar{t}\) production should be measured with at least 10% accuracy since it constitutes the main background to other new physics channels (Higgs, SUSY searches etc).

Finally one can measure the rare and exotic decays of the top ex. t\(\to\)bH\({}^{+}\) for light Higgs; t\(\to\)Zc which gives limits at the level of 10\({}^{\rm 4}\) to 10\({}^{\rm 5}\) for the FCNC couplings. The single top production will give precision for the CKM matrix element

Distributions are shown for the SM (shaded histogram) and for non-standard values (white histograms) \(\lambda\gamma\)=0.01 (left) and \(\Delta\)ky=0.2 (right).

\(\rm V_{tb}\) at the level of 10%. Furthermore, the study of its lepton asymmetry will test the CP-violation.

## 5 B-physics

The high statistics of the \(b\overline{b}\) events (2*10\({}^{10}\)\(b\overline{b}\) pairs per year pass the level 1 trigger) will permit precise measurements for the CP violation parameter sin2\(\beta\) using the decay \(B_{d}^{0}\rightarrow\)J/\(\psi\)+\(\rm K_{s}\)\({}^{0}\) and, of angle \(\alpha\) using the decay \(B_{d}^{0}\rightarrow\pi\pi\). Oscillations between \(B_{s}^{0}\) and \(\overline{B}_{s}^{0}\) will be detected if their mass difference is up to \(\Delta\)m\({}_{\rm s}\)=38.5 ps\({}^{-1}\). Furthermore, the rare decay \(\rm B_{s}\) to two muons should be discovered even if the branching ratio is at the range predicted by the SM (10\({}^{-9}\) to 10\({}^{-10}\)) and not enhanced, as predicted by new physics.

## 6 Potential for the Higgs boson discovery

_Standard Model Higgs_

The theoretical upper limit is 1 TeV derived from unitarity arguments.The current lower limit is 114.4 GeV from the LEP2 measurements [5]. The mass region for the Higgs search can be divided in three different regions:

_1. Low mass region (m\({}_{H}\)\(<\)130 GeV)_

The dominant decay channel is the H\(\rightarrow\)\(b\overline{b}\), with a large cross section (\(\sim\)20 pb) but with a signal/background ratio of 10\({}^{-5}\), which yields the observation impossible. The H\(\rightarrow\)\(\gamma\gamma\) decay channel is rare, has a much smaller cross-section (\(\sim\)50 fb) but a much better signal/background ratio (\(\sim\)10\({}^{-2}\)). Therefore, an excellent energy and a very good angular resolution of the em calorimeter, as well as, an excellent jet rejection is necessary in order to extract the resonant peak above the reducible \(\gamma\)jet, jetjet and irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) background, as show in Fig.3.

Figure 3: Expected H\(\rightarrow\)\(\gamma\gamma\) signal for m\({}_{\rm H}\)=120 GeV and for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). The signal is shown on top of the irreducible background (left) and after subtraction of this background (right).

In addition, the associated Higgs production \(t\overline{t}\) H followed by the H\(\to b\overline{b}\) decay, where an additional lepton from the decay of the accompanying particles is used for trigger purposes, can increase the sensitivity of the Higgs discovery in this mass region. The final state is complex consisting of two W-bosons and four b-jets. Both top quarks should be fully reconstructed which requires an excellent b-tagging capability. Fig 4 shows the reconstructed mass of a 120 GeV Higgs, where the Higgs boson appears as an excess over the background.

#### 2.2 Intermediate mass region (130 GeV \(<\)m\({}_{H}\)\(<\) 2m\({}_{Z}\))

The most promising observation channel is the H\(\to ZZ^{*}\)\(\to\) 41, where the backgrounds are: reducible from \(t\overline{t}\)\(\to\) 4l+X and \(Z\,b\overline{b}\)\(\to\) 4l+X which are hopefully reduced by lepton isolation and impact parameter/displaced vertex cuts. Furthermore, one lepton pair should have an effective mass compatible with the \(Z\) mass. The H\(\to\) WW\({}^{(*)}\)\(\to\) lvlv channel has a larger branching ratio but is more difficult experimentally because the presence of the two neutrinos in the final state reduce the Higgs discovery to counting an excess of events in the transverse mass distribution, as shown in Fig.5. A better than 5% systematic uncertainty in the background is required.

Figure 4: Invariant mass distribution, m \(b\overline{b}\) of tagged b-jet pairs in fully reconstructed \(t\overline{t}\) H signal events with a Higgs boson mass of 120 GeV above the summed background, for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). The points with error bars represent the result of a single experiment and the dashed line represents the background distribution.

#### iii.1.3 High mass region (\(m_{H}>\)2m\({}_{Z}\))

The best discovery channel is the "golden plated" H\(\rightarrow\) ZZ\(\rightarrow\) 4l channel, where the background is very small due to the constraint of the two reconstructed di-lepton masses to be both compatible with the Z-mass. For very high masses (m\({}_{\rm H}>\) 700GeV) the decays H\(\rightarrow\) WW\(\rightarrow\) lvjj and H\(\rightarrow\) ZZ\(\rightarrow\) llvv, H\(\rightarrow\) ZZ\(\rightarrow\) lljj, due to their higher branching ratios, will enhance the discovery sensitivity and compensate for the lower production cross-sections\({}^{(6)}\). Fig.6 shows the overall sensitivity covering the full mass range as given in reference \({}^{(3)}\). A signal significance of 5 sigmas over the background is possible after the first three years of running..

Figure 5: Transverese mass distibution for the summed H\(\rightarrow\) WW\({}^{(*)}\)\(\rightarrow\)lvly signal (m\({}_{\rm H}\)=150 GeV) and total background for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). The distribution for the background alone is also shown separately. The shaded histogram represents the contributions from Wt and \(t\overline{t}\) background. The dashed lines indicate the selected signal region.

Recently [7], the low mass region sensitivity has been considerably ameliorated by including the so-called "Vector Boson Fusion (VBF)" channels. The relevant diagram is shown in Fig.7 where the Higgs bosons is produced by the fusion of two energetic vector bosons radiated by the incoming quarks in the boson bremsstrahlung process[8].

Figure 6: Expected discovery potential for a SM Higgs boson in ATLAS, for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{\mbox{-}1}\). The VBF channels are not included (see below).

Figure 7: The Vector Boson Fusion Feynman diagram for the SM Higgs boson production.

The cross-section is only 20% of the total cross-section (for m\({}_{\rm H}\)=130 GeV) but the process produces a very characteristic signature -two very energetic jets in the forward and backward region of the detector together with a reduced hadronic activity in the central region of the detector. By applying forward tagging techniques plus a central jet veto cut, the background can be drastically reduced. The channels qqH followed by WW\({}^{(*)}\)\(\rightarrow\) lvlv or H\(\rightarrow\)\(\uptau\)\(\rightarrow\) fully leptonic or semileptonic decay have been studied. By applying additional cuts for the two isolated leptons and cuts on the lepton angular correlations and on the di-lepton mass, one can achieve a very good signal to background ratio as shown in Fig.8.

The overall discovery significance is greatly enhanced with the addition of the above channels as shown in Fig.9.

Figure 8: Accepted signal cross-section as a function of the transverse mass for the qqH\(\rightarrow\) WW\({}^{(*)}\)\(\rightarrow\)lvlv signal (m\({}_{\rm H}\)=160 GeV) The distribution for the background alone is also shown separately.

Fig. 9 clearly shows that combining the "standard" channels with the previously described VBF ones, then a greater than 5 sigma significance can be achieved _with ATLAS alone after one year running in the low luminosity_ in the mass region 120-190 GeV.

_Determination of the standard Model Higgs parameters_

If the Higgs boson exists it should be discovered after the first year of running in low luminosity. After its discovery, the emphasis will be shifted to the precision with which the various mass parameters can be measured.

_Mass determination_: The mass can be measured with a precision of 0.1% up to 400 GeV by combining both experiments and for an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) as shown in Fig.10.The precision is dominated by the H\(\rightarrow\) ZZ\(\rightarrow\) 4l decay channel, where the absolute energy scale is more precisely determined. The Vector Boson Fusion decay modes do not increase the precision.

Figure 9: Expected discovery potential for a SM Higgs boson in ATLAS alone, for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\). The VBF channels are included.

_Measurement of the width_: A direct measurement of the width of the reconstructed mass unfolding the experimental resolution is possible only for masses higher than 200 GeV, where the instrinsic width becomes larger than the experimental resolution. The region is covered mostly by the H\(\rightarrow\) ZZ \(\rightarrow\) 4l decays and the ultimate precision is of the order of 5%.

_Measurement of the Higgs rates, BR's and couplings_: Measurements of the Higgs rate in a given channel correspond to the product of the production cross-section times the specific branching ratio (BR). If we suppose that the cross-section is accurately predicted by theory, then one gets from the measurement of the rate, a determination of the BR of the specific channel. The largest uncertainty of the measurement (at best 7%) is on the knowledge of the absolute luminosity (at best down to 5%). On the other hand, by measuring ratios of rates for different channels, one avoids the theoretical assumptions and the uncertainty in the luminosity - which cancels out- and gets ratios of couplings and BR's. As an example, one can measure the ratio of the Higgs boson couplings to bosons and fermions directly by measuring the ratio of VBF channels. More specifically, the ratio of \(\sigma\)*BR(qq\(\rightarrow\) qqH( \(\mathrm{H}\)\(\rightarrow\) WW))/\(\sigma\)*BR(qq\(\rightarrow\) qqH( \(\mathrm{H}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\tau\))) provides a direct measurement of the \(\Gamma_{\mathrm{W}}\)/\(\Gamma_{\mathrm{\tau}}\) partial width and improves greatly the its measurement accuracy in the 120-150 GeV mass range, as shown in Fig.11 together with expectations from indirect measurements.

The different open symbols correspond to different channels. The black triangles correspond to the combination of all channels for an overall uncertainty of 0.1% on the absolute scale of the em calorimeter.

_Supersymmetric Higgs_

In the most common supersymmetric scenario, the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the SM (MSSM), five Higgs bosons are predicted [h, H(CP even), A (CP odd), H\({}^{\pm}\)]. Two free parameters are left at the tree level, so the discovery limits are commonly expressed in terms of defining a plane where contours in m\({}_{\rm A}\) and tan\(\beta\) are drawn. The LEP2 results have excluded a region of the plane (the low tan\(\beta\) region).

In addition to the SM channels described above, the most promising supersymmetric Higgs discovery channels, in the large tan\(\beta\) region, are the H/A\(\to\)\(\tau\)t,

H/A\(\to\)\(\mu\mu\) channels and the charged Higgs decays. The H/A\(\to\)\(\tau\)t decay channel has a higher production rate compared to the \(\mu\mu\) one, since the couplings are the same but the BR's scale with \((\mbox{m}_{\rm u}/\mbox{m}_{\tau}\ )^{2}\), but it is more difficult to be reconstructed. On the other hand, the \(\mu\mu\) one produces a very clean signature, a clear peak over the background in the di-muon effective mass distribution as shown in Fig.12. The charged Higgs particles mostly produced by the gb or the gg fusion diagrams, can be detected through the \(\,H^{\pm}\to\tau\nu\,,\ H^{\pm}\to c\overline{s}\,\) decay or \(\,H^{+}\to tb\,\) if the charged Higgs is heavier than the top quark or \(\,t\to H^{+}b\,\) if the \(\,H^{+}\,\) is lighter than the top quark. Furthermore, since the decay \(\,H^{-}\to\tau_{L}^{-}\nu\,\) is forbidden in the standard two Higgs doublet model type II, such as the MSSM, its observation and further measurement of the polarization asymmetry, can provide evidence for models with a singlet neutrino in large extra dimensions \({}^{(9)}\).

Figure 11: Relative precision on the measured ratio of the Higgs-boson couplings to bosons over the Higgs-boson couplings to fermions as a function of m\({}_{\rm H}\,\) for ATLAS and CMS combined, for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). The VBF channels are included.

The discovery contours in the \(\rm m_{A}-tan\beta\) parameter space are model and stop mixing dependent. Not all mixings have been studied; the minimal mixing has been excluded by LEP2 results. The scenario where the SUSY particles are heavy ( above 1 TeV) so the Higgses do not decay to them and maximal mixing occurs, is shown in Fig.13 for only one year of initial running, both experiments combined.

Figure 12: For an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) and tan\(\beta=\)30, the distribution of \(\rm m_{pu}\) is shown for the reducible \(t\bar{t}\) background (shaded histogram), for the total summed background (dashed curve) and for the sum H/A\(\rightarrow\)\(\rm\mu\) signal with \(\rm m_{A}\)\({}^{=}\)300 GeV and of the background (solid histogram).

Figure 13: ATLAS plus CMS sensitivity for the discovery of MSSM Higgs bosons (in the case of maximal mixing). The 5\(\sigma\) discovery curves are shown in the (\(\rm m_{A}\)tan\(\beta\)) plane for individual channels as indicated and for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\).Also included is the present LEP2 limit.

In this scenario the full parameter plane can be covered with full luminosity, and over a large fraction of it, more than one Higgs are observable.

Also scenarios where the SUSY particles are light and can appear as Higgs decay products have been studied in the framework of SUGRA models. The lightest neutral Higgs h discovery potential does not significantly change since the h\(\rightarrow\widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\)\(\widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) decay is kinematically forbidden. In addition, the h can appear as a decay product of the NLSP \(\widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\rightarrow\widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) h.

## 7 Searches for supersymmetry

A quick and efficient way to discover the SUSY particles, if they exist, is searching for events with multiple jets and large missing transverse energy, since the gluinos and squarks will be produced with high cross-sections and will finally decay to weakly interacting LSP's. ATLAS has investigated in detail signatures for particular points in the parameter space of the SUGRA model (6 points), the Gauge Mediated SUSY breaking (GMSB) Model and R-parity violating models.

Another investigation method is to look for kinematic endpoints in the mass distributions resulting from decay cascades. An example is the \(\widetilde{q}_{L}\rightarrow\) q\(\widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\) decay followed by \(\widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\rightarrow\widetilde{l}_{R}I\), \(\widetilde{l}_{R}\rightarrow\)\(I\)\(\widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) decay. The di-lepton effective mass shown in Fig.14 for SUGRA point 5 (m\({}_{0}\)=100GeV,m\({}_{1/2}\)=300GeV,A\({}_{0}\)=300,tan\(\beta\)=2.1,\(\mu\)\(>\)0) presents a distinctive endpoint which depends on the \(\widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\)- \(\widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) mass difference. The position of the endpoint can be determined with a precision of 500 MeV (0.5%) for an intergrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Figure 14: Dilepton \(\widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\rightarrow\widetilde{l}_{R}I\rightarrow\widetilde{ \chi}^{0}_{1}\)\(I\) signal at SUSY Point 5 (solid), background from other SUSY sources (dashed), and sum of SM backgrounds (dotted) after cuts

One can then proceed and determine the masses of squarks and gluinos from combinations of 2 or 3 jets with fully reconstructed \(\,\widetilde{\chi}_{2}^{\,0}\,\)'s. For example, one expects to reconstruct the squark mass from a typical decay chain like: \(\,\widetilde{q}\rightarrow\widetilde{g}q\rightarrow(\,\widetilde{\chi}_{2}^{\,0} \,q\overline{q})q\,\). This way the squark and the gluino masses can be reconstructed up to 2 TeV.

Another example is the search for h\(\,\rightarrow\,\)\(b\overline{b}\,\) decay in SUSY events. If the decay \(\,\widetilde{\chi}_{2}^{\,0}\,\rightarrow\,\)h\(\,\widetilde{\chi}_{1}^{\,0}\,\) is kinematically allowed, it can be a discovery channel for two new particles at the same time. Apart from discovering SUSY- if it exists- ATLAS should also be able to determine the fundamental parameters of the underlying theory, with a precision of 1-10% and distinguish between the various models

## 8 Other physics, exotics

ATLAS should be able to look for:

* _Technicolor_ resonances up to the TeV range. Some have very clean signatures, for example p\(\,\rightarrow\,\) WZ\(\,\rightarrow\,\)lvl.
* _Excited quarks_, looking for q*\(\,\rightarrow\,\)q\(\,\gamma\) decays, with masses up to \(\sim\) 5-6 TeV.
* _Leptoquarks_ for masses up to 1.5 TeV.
* _New vector bosons_ (W' and Z') given by extensions of the SM with masses up to \(\sim\) 5-6 TeV.
* _Compositeness_ by investigating for an excess of high p\(\,\)r jets for a compositeness scale up to \(\Lambda_{\rm comp}\)\(\sim\) 40 TeV for an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\)
* _Extra dimensions and the TeV-scale gravity_ (mini black holes).Mini black holes with masses as low as few TeV's can exist in the framework of theories with extra dimensions if the gravity scale is around 1 TeV. The production cross-section is huge, several tenths of pb's. Then, they evaporate almost simultaneously (10\({}^{-26}\) sec) into standard particles producing a spectacular signature: large charged particle multiplicity, large deposited energy, high sphericity events and hadronic to leptonic activity ratio of about 5:1. Following a method suggested in [10], one can apply several cuts (asking for four energetic jets etc) to separate possible background and then use electrons and photons to determine the Hawking temperature, T\({}_{\rm H}\), as a function of the black hole mass M\({}_{\rm BH}\). From a log-log plot of T\({}_{\rm H}\) versus M\({}_{\rm BH}\) one can then determine the number of extra dimensions.

## 10 Conclusions

The ATLAS detector has a broad physics potential extending from discovering, in very short time, new particles as for instance the Higgs boson and supersymmetric particles -if they exist- to performing precisison measurements on the electroweak front. All that remains to be done is to finish up the detector and the machine construction!
