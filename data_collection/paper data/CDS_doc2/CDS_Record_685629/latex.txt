Further exploration of the structural properties of gas calorimeters (SPACAL - type) by means of the simulation on the GEANT3.15 code

Protvino 1992Introduction.

In the first paper[1] there were investigated main properties of gas-lead tubes calorimeters with different sizes of tube-diameters and distances between these tubes. The lead medium of the calorimeters is filled with rows of gas ionization tubes shifted relatively each other by half of the tube step. The paper at the same time does not contain investigations about the influence of the electric field in ionization tubes and the absorption of a created charge in gas medium on amplitude distributions of a signal. There was not analysed also the specific form of the very forward calorimeter in future detectors intended for the study properties of high energy colliding particles. These and other questions will be analysed in the work with the help of the GEANT3.15 programme[2].

## 2 Electromagnetic Calorimeter.

The main deficiency of tubes calorimeters[1] is the presence of the line effect, when electrons enter with some slope angles to the tube axis and along planes of tube rows. At the case the dispersion of an amplitude distribution of a signal is enlarged and the distribution can ever devide into two parts for the big value of the slope angle. The'effect can be explained by the relatively small size of the central part of an electromagnetic shower, where about 50% of the ionization energy is released, in comparison with the calorimeter structural dimensions. To diminish the influence of the line effect the definite design of a calorimeter (the prototype) is proposed, where ionization tubes are disposed along circumferences around the beam axis of colliding particles(fig.1b). The figure 2 presents tube cross- and longitudinal-sections.

For definiteness there were taken the following sizes. The diameter of a tube is D=0.5 cm, the thickness of a tube wall is t(Fe)=0.03 cm, the electrode diameter is d(Fe)=0.06 cm. The length of a gas ionization tube equals l=15 cm. All tubes are filled with the gas mixture (\(90\%Ar+10\%CF_{4}\)) under the pressure P=30 atm. The distance between rows of tubes along the radius of the prototype is 1 cm and between tubes along circumference is 1.05 cm. The diameter of the prototype module is 20 cm.

The simulation was carried out for electrons with the energy E=5 GeV wich entered into the central part of the prototype (marked by the cross in fig.1) with uniform sowing at the area 3*3 \(cm^{2}\). The slope angle of particles to the Z-axis in the Z-X plane is \(\theta(X)=5^{0}\). After examing the figure 1b it is evident that this design of a calorimeter contains also zones where there are lines of tube rows along the system diameter. That is there can be observed the line effect. Under these reason the slope angle for the simulation was chosen in the Z-X plane.

In the fig.3a one can see the general amplitude distribution and in fig.3(b,c) amplitude distributions for two different entry points of particles into the prototype. Resulting distributions for the zero slope angle and entry points of particles between tubes and into the electrode of a tube are given in fig.3d. From comparison of these figures one can conclude that the long tail of the whole amplitude distribution for the given slope angle is conditioned not only by spreading charge particles along gas tubes but rather different numbers of different tubes configurations, activated by given particles showers. And it is the main cause and effect. Therefore the whole amplitude distribution reflects nonuniformity of a calorimeter and the long tail is consequence of a small number of some tube configurations. Such phenomenons take place only for small number of tubes activated by particles showers (table 1). The greate importance has also the particle interaction at electrodes for small values of the slope angle.

To entirely eliminate the contribution of the line effect to the energy resolution for radial dispersing particles in an electromagnetic calorimeter it is proposed a new design - the flaky calorimeter (fig.1a). For a very forward calorimeter the best lay-out of tubes is along a circumference around the beam line. The new design contains the sequence of layers with 3 rows of tubes. The first two rows of each layer have equal numbers of tubes placed the same manner as in the line structure[1]. The third row contains the maximum allowed number of tubes entended for the registration of shower remainders not recorded by first two rows. The necessity of the third row is absent for tightly filled calorimeter and there are only the first two rows of tubes in each lay.

For the flaky calorimeter there were used the same sizes as for the prototype. The number of tubes in each third row was enlarged by the factor K=1.4 in comparing with the calculated one. The general view of the resulting amplitude distribution is shown in fig.4a for electrons with the energy E=5 GeV and with the uniform sowing at the area 3*3 \(cm^{2}\) (the central entry point is marked by cross in fig.1a). The slope angle to the Z-axis in the Y-Z plane is 5\({}^{0}\). Amplitude distributions for different entry points of particles are presented in fig.4(c-d) in the same manner as for fig.3. There is some improvement of the signal form but it is rather explained by the enlarged number of ionization tubes (20%) compared with the prototype one. The deficiencies of the tubes structure for both designs are the same. In the tables 1 and 2 one can see values of the energy resolution for both electromagnetic calorimeters.

In contradistinction to an ionization plate calorimeter there is nonlinear charge collection in an ionization tube (fig.5). For example, if a charge with the value Ne is created at the point \(r_{0}\) in gas medium of an ionization tube[3] then the resulting signal will be equal to

\[\Delta U=-\frac{Ne}{c}\frac{ln(r_{0}/r_{i})}{ln(r_{a}/r_{i})}, \tag{1}\]

where \(r_{a}\) - the tube radius, \(r_{i}\) - the electrode radius. Therefore as it is evident from fig.5 every particle passing through a tube gives some dispersion into the resulting amplitude one and the more big value then bigger the tube diameter. The contribution of the tube-particle dispersion is described by the first term in the expression for an energy resolution:

\[\left(\frac{\sigma}{A}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{C_{1}^{\cdot\cdot\cdot}}{\sqrt{E }}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{C_{2}}{E}\right)^{2}+C_{3}^{2}. \tag{2}\]

The values of the energy resolution for the nonlinear charge collection are also presented at the tables 1 and 2. One can see there is not any difference between cases with linear and nonlinear charge collections. There are also data for situations when one takes into account the electric field of each ionization tube or when a calorimeter is placed into a magnetic field as a whole. The GEANT code has the procedure which calculates a magnetic field influence on each particles. For the calculation of an electric field influence the procedure was modernized (see the Supplement 1), From the data presented at the tables 1 and 2 one can conclude that the electric field of ionization tubes (F=4.5 kv) does not affect the value of the energy resolution (the value of an amplitude does not changed). The presence of a strong magnetic field directed across the beam direction somewhat increases the value of a signal and the corresponding energy resolution is slightly decreased (\(5-10\%\)) for the rough calorimeters. This effect has to be more stronger for a high energy particles because of a more large path-length of a shower.

There was checked also an influence of a charge absorption on the amplitude distribution. The absorption is counts up with the help of the Birk coefficient[5]. The effective charge value in medium is described by the expression:

\[\frac{dQ}{dx}=C\frac{\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\ dE/dx}{1+K\rho\star dE/dx}, \tag{3}\]

where for a gas medium it is usual empled the following value:

\[K\rho=0.003\frac{g}{MeV*cm^{2}}.\]

It is evident from the data that the charge absorption in a gas medium for electromagnetic calorimeters does not affect an energy resolution even for the value of the Birk coefficient

\[K\rho=0.010\frac{g}{MeV*cm^{2}}.\]

Unlike liquid and solid medium the gas one is affected by temperature and pressure therefore the amplitude value can be also affected by these parameters as a consequence of different ionization properties for gas medium. The mean value of ionization losses is described by the Bethe-Bloch formula in which the adjusted term \(\delta\) depends on density of medium[2,7]. The term depends on a parameter X:

\[X=log_{10}(p/m_{0}c),\]

where \(m_{0}\) - mass of an incoming charge particle and p - its momentum. The dependence of the parameter on pressure and temperature is defined as (subroutine GPROBI in the GEANT code):

\[X\to X+0.5*\dot{log}_{10}\Big{(}P(\alpha m)\frac{273}{273+t^{0}C}\Big{)}.\]

According to the calculation the amplitude value is slightly enlarged (\(1-2\%\)), but the energy resolution does not change in fact.

Let us now estimate the constant term in the expression (2). Its value is defined by the following things:

-- inaccuracy of calibration coefficients, the presence of dead zones, incconstancy of pressure and temperature and so on. For definiteness let this contribution to the constant term be equal to 1%.

-- the energy leakage from a calorimeter. Let the contribution be equal to 1% because of the longitudinal disposition of ionization tubes along the beam direction.

-- the dependence of the amplitude value of a signal on the entry point of incoming electrons into an electromagnetic calorimeter. It is followed from fig.3 and fig.4 that the difference of amplitude values can be very large especially for a zero slope angle of beam particles to the tube axis.

With the increasing value of a slope angle the amplitude difference is decreased because of the growing number of activated ionization tubes by shower particles. Such behaviour is explained by a very small size of the central part of an electromagnetic shower. According to the tables 1 and 2 the central part of an electromagnetic shower occupies'the region of two tubes only.

From the data presented in fig.3 it is followed that the ratio of the extreme low average amplitude to the extreme high one (according to the different entry points) is 1:3. Assuming that this amplitude interval contains about 2 units of the amplitude dispersion at very high energy (or according to the flat distribution \(\sigma=(A_{2}-A_{1})/\sqrt{12}\)) one can obtain that the energy resolution is equal to 50% for given prototype. That is the electromagnetic energy resolution for the prototype for the slope angle about\({}^{11}\)5\({}^{0}\) is expressed (without noise term) as

\[\left(\frac{\sigma}{A}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{E}}\right)^{2}+ \overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{ \overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset}}}}}}}{}}{}}{}}{}}{}}{}}}{ }^{11}+\overset{1}{2}+50^{2}\approx\left(\frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{E}}\right)^{2}+50^{2}. \tag{4}\]

For the flaky calorimeter (fig.4) one can see that the same amplitude ratio is 1:2.4 and the constant term is expressed as

\[\left(C_{3}\right)^{2}=\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{ \overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{ \overset{\overset{\}}}}}}{}}{}}{}}{}}{}}}{}}{}^{12}+40^{2} \approx 40^{2}.\]

It is necessary to mention that for the exact definition of the minimum and maximum amplitudes the estimated value of a parameter C is an upper value and it coincides with the experimental one only for uniform distribution of the zones.

To check this evaluations there were calculated electron energy resolutions for the flaky calorimeter for different energy points. The data were fitted by two expressions

\[\left(\frac{\sigma}{A}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{E}}\right)^{2}+C_{2 }\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{ \overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{\overset{ \overset{ \overset{ \overset{ }}}}}}}}}}{}}{}{}}{}{}{}}{} {}}}{}C_{1}=63,C_{2}=40, \tag{5}\]

\[\left(\frac{\sigma}{A}\right)=\left(\frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{E}}\right)+C_{2},C_{1}=2 6,C_{2}=37. \tag{6}\]

According to experimental data obtained for the SPACAL-calorimeter[6] the expression (6) is more preferable than (5). It can be explained by contributions of processes not described with the Gauss distribution. The adjusted parameter values are presented in expressions (5) and (6) and the corresponding curves are plotted in fig.8a.

Thus from the carried out investigation the main conclusion can be derived - the size of distances between tubes and the slope angle of particles to the tube axis define the value of the constant term in the expression for an energy resolution. According to the expression (6) at the electron energy E= 10 GeV the energy resolution is entirely defined by the constant term \(C_{2}\) (for sufficiently large values of distancies between tubes \(L\approx 1\) cm). Therefore the qualitative dependence of the parameter \(C_{2}^{i}\) with altering parameters L and \(\theta\) can be obtained from the data presented at the paper[1].

The increasing of a slope angle(at its small value) is accompanied by the propotional decreasing of the energy resolution. For instance, at the slope angle \(10^{0}\) according to the simulation there was obtained that the parameter \(C_{2}=25\%\).

To decrease essentially the energy resolution constant it is necessary that the value of an absober width between gas tubes was less than 3 mm (\(L\ll 1cm\)) for small values of a slope angle. At the same time for the very tightly filled calorimeter by gas tubes and for their small slope angle to the beam particles the particles shower will be formed in iron tubes wall. As a consequence [5] the value of a compensation parameter will be increased. In order to avoid this the slope angle has to be increased. Therefore it is necessary to choose such slope angle wich would minimize C- constant and e/h- parameter. According to [1] values of the constant C are about 1% in the range \(\theta=(15^{0}-20^{0})\) depending on values L and D (for \(\theta=90^{0}\) C= 0).

As an example there was simulated an (optimal) flake calorimeter wich consists of layers oy only two tubes fows shifted along each other by the half of the tube- step. The whole tube diameter is equal to 4.6 mm where the width of iron walls is 0.3 mm. The distance between tube axises along the calorimeter radius and along circumferences is equal to 7 mm. The slope angle of beam particles in the radial plane is \(10^{0}\). There was obtained the following resolution:

\[\left(\frac{\sigma}{A}\right)=\left(\frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{E}}\right)+C_{2},C_{1}= 29,C_{2}=6. \tag{7}\]

The tubes slope angle in the radial plane has not to be very large because of the large deviation of the rear tube end from beam axis (for \(\theta=12^{0}\) the deviation at the distance 2 m is about 40 cm and there will be a large error in the coordinate estimation). In the case the missing \(P_{t}\) of an event will not be observed exactly. To diminish this deficiency it is proposed to separate every tube in two parts where the first part is inclined to the beam axis at the angle \(172^{0}\) and the second one at \(12^{0}\). The second part of tube can be divide also into two parts inclined at different angles. It will improve the coordinate estimation of the observed energy in the whole tube. The place of the first separation can be situated at the distance 1 interaction length then the first part of tubes will imitate electromagnetic (optimal) calorimeter. The constant value of the electromagnetic energy resolution can be decreased to 1% for the slope angle \(15^{0}\). There was simulated the hadron calorimeter with minimal value of L and D [1], wich is close to the (optimal) one. Therefore one can estimate the hadron characteristics of (optimal) hadron calorimeter:

\[\left(\frac{\sigma}{A}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{(110-120)}{\sqrt{E}}\right)^{2} +\left(3-5\right)^{2}\]

\[e/\pi=(1.15-1.20).\]

It is preferably to have an electromagnetic and hadron parts of a forward calorimeter because of:

- in each tube of a very forward calorimeter will be observed large value of released energy; therefore decreasing of the energy will ensure more stable regime for the tubes;

- the energy resolution constant of a hadron calorimeter due to its noncompensation can be decreased if there are some longitudinal sections [8];

- the very forward calorimeter will be filled to overflowing by entry particles [9] therefore it will measure the.jet energy but not the energy of particles; every jet containes a broad energy distribution of particles and because of non-liniar response of a calorimeter to hadrons with energy between 0 and 10 GeV the whole energy will be observed incorrectly; the presence of electromagnetic calorimeter will improve the situation.

## 3 About Hadron Calorimeter

In the work[1] there was also investigated the structure of a gas-lead calorimeter where ionization gas tubes contained thick inner electrodes. The values of diameters of a tube and its electrode are comparable. These design of a calorimeter can be exploited as a hadron one since the size of a hadron shower is sufficiently large and the dependence of the amplitude value of a signal on coordinates of particle entry points is not of vital importance. For example, for the distance between tubes about 2 cm the mean difference of amplitude values is about 10% for the energy of pions E= 9 GeV. That is the value of the constant \(C_{2}\) in (6) will be much lower.

Because of the large diameter value of the electrode in an ionization tube the distribution of the ionization energy differs from that for a small one (fig.5 and fig.6). In fig.6 the ratio of a tube diameter to the electrode one is equal to 3:2. The distribution of the ionization energy in the tube has an evident asymmetry and is not described by the Gauss distribution. The assymmetry has to be displaied in the amplitude distribution of a signal. At the same time the assymmetry is disappeared for the ratio 2:1. To check the influence of the observed assymmetry onto the form of amplitude distribution there were simulated two design of a calorimeter: one with the ratio of the two diameters as 1.32/0.82 cm = 3:2 and the other with the ratio 1.32/0.66 cm = 2:1. The top part of fig.7 presents two amplitude distributions for the energy incoming pions E= 30 and 56 GeV with the slope angle \(\theta=2^{0}\) for the diameter ratio 3:2. The same one can see for the ratio 2:1 at the bottom part of fig.7. One can conclude that bottom distributions are better described by the Gauss distribution than upper ones.

The constant term in the expression for an energy resolution is determined mainly by the following three factors:

-- leakage of a hadron shower from a calorimeter, the presence of dead zones, inaccuracy of calibration coefficients and so on. The summary contribution to the energy resolution can be reduced to the value 1%.

-- the dependence of the amplitude value of a signal on coordinates of entry points of particles into a calorimeter. For sufficiently small values of the tube diameter and the distance between tubes (L,D \(\ll\) 2 cm) these contributions to the energy resolution can be lower than 2%.

-- noncompensation of a hadron calorimeter. As it was shown in the work[1] a hadron calorimeter is a rough detector for the registration of electrons because of a strong dependence of the amplitude value of a signal on coordinates of entry points of leptons into a calorimeter. Therefore the compensation parameter will be differ from 1. Let for definiteness for the energy of pions E= 30 Gev the ratio \(e/\pi\) is equal to 1.1 and 1.25 (the value of the compensation parameter depends on the slope angle of particles to the tube axis[1]).

R.Wigmans[6] has proposed the following dependence of the ratio \(e/\pi\) on the intrinsic compensation parameter e/h:

\[\frac{e}{\pi}(E)=\frac{\stackrel{{\mbox{\tiny$\vee$}}}{{\mbox{ \tiny$\pi$}}}e/h}{1+(e/\pi)\stackrel{{\mbox{\tiny$\vee$}}}{{\mbox{ \tiny$\pi$}}}(1-1)*0.11*ln(E)}, \tag{7}\]

For the chosen values of \(e/\pi\) the values of e/h-parameter are 1.17 and 1.46.

At the energy of pions E= 700 GeV first two terms in the expressions (2) can be omitted then the energy resolution defined by the constant term will depends on the energy dispersion between hadron and electromagnetic parts of a shower. The mean electromagnetic part of the registered shower energy equals 0.11*lnE=0.7 [6]. Let for definiteness its dispersion is equal to 0.15. (According to the simulation this value is changed in the region 0.15-0.25 with the particles energy because of large assymmetry of distributions. Other estimation can be found in [5] trough the average number of created \(\pi^{0}\) - mesons: (n= 5*Jn(E)-4.6). Therefore 0.15 is the lower value and all estimations will be lower bounds). Then the amplitude value of a hadron signal with the ratio 7:3 of electromagnetic and hadron parts of a shower energy with e/h=1.17 is equal to 1.17*7+1.0*3 = 11.19 units. The second value of the amplitude for the ratio 8.5:1.5 is \(A_{2}\)= 1.17*8.5+1.0*1.5 = 11.445 units. And the energy resolution is defined by \(C_{3}\), where \(C_{3}=\sigma/A_{1}=(11.445-11.19)/11.19=2.3\%\). The same calculations for the compensation parameter e/h=1.46 gives the value \(C_{3}=\sigma/A_{1}=5.3\%\).

Therefore the value of the constant term for a hadron calorimeter will be changed between 3% and 6% with the ratio \(e/\pi\) altered between 1.1 and 1.3 for the discussed conditions. (According to [5] these estimations are equal to 3 and 9%).

## 4 Conclusion.

With the help of the GEANT3i5 programme there was carried out'the investigation of two designs of a very forward calorimeter. The lead medium of the calorimeter is filled with gas ionization tubes orientated along beam particles direction and with a small value of the slope angle. It was shown that for the flaky design of the calorimeter there is absent the linear structure of ionization tubes for radial dispersing particles which lead to the broadening of amplitude distributions of a signal (line effect). At the same time in the tubes structure of a calorimeter with the even distributed tubes along circumferences there are zones with the presence of the line effect for radial dispersing particles.

The presence of electric and magnetic fields does not essential affect the amplitude value of a signal. The amplitude value for an electromagnetic calorimeter does not change also with the absorption of created ionization charges in a gas medium. The value of the constant term in the expression for an energy resolution is essential affected by the size of a distance between tubes because of the relatively small size of the central part of an electromagnetic shower (about 50% of registered energy) for the longitudinal orientation of ionization tubes. The form of an amplitude distribution can be very asymmetric with a long tail because of interactions at charge collecting electrodes of tubes and the large fluctuation of the number of differently situated tubes activated by a particles shower. To diminish these deficiencies it will be necessary to decrease the distance size between ionization tubes (\(L\ll 1\)) and their spacing distribution has to be uniform one for the radial dispersing particles.

For the design of a hadron calorimeter with gas rings it is necessary to hold the ratio of a tube diameter and its electrode diameter as 2:1. At the case the form of an amplitude distribution will be much closer to the Gauss one than for other ratios. It is conditioned by the asymmetry of the ionization energy distribution in gas rings. The constant value in the expression for an energy resolution depends on the compensation parameter of a hadron calorimeter. There can be formulated some design requirements for a very forward calorimeter (\(\eta>3\)):

- the absorber width between ionization tubes has to be less than 3 mm (\(L\ll 1cm\)) to achive the minimal value of an energy resolution;

- the slope angle of ionization tubes to the beam axis in the radial plane has to be choosen so to minimize the constant value for energy resolution and the compensation parameter.

## 5 Supplement 1.

The motion of an electric particles in the electric field is described as[4]:

\[\frac{d\mathbf{P}}{dt}=e\mathbf{E},\]

where \(e\),\(\mathbf{P}\),\(\mathbf{E}\) - are charge, momentum of the particle and the tension of the electric field. After some transformations one can obtain:

\[\frac{d\mathbf{V}}{dt}=\frac{e}{\gamma m}\Big{(}\mathbf{E}-\frac{\mathbf{V}( \mathbf{V}*\mathbf{E})}{c^{2}}\Big{)}.\]

Transfering to the derivaties along a trajectory of the particle one can derive:

\[\mathbf{X}^{\prime\prime}=e\Big{(}\frac{\mathbf{E}}{P\beta c}-\frac{\beta}{ Pc}\frac{\mathbf{V}(\mathbf{V}*\mathbf{E})}{V^{2}}\Big{)}.\]

The equation has been solved with the Runge-Kutta method exploited in the GEANT code. It was supposed the electric field is constant value over a the step length which value is simulated in the GEANT. The result does not change for the more precise dependence of the electric field on coordinates.
