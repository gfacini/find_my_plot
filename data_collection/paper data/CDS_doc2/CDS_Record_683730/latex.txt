## 1 Introduction

The high complexity of the ATLAS Muon detector necessitates careful planning of the spatial arrangement of chambers, supply units and interconnecting supply lines like cables, optical fibres, cooling and gas pipes. One aim is to optimise the logistics for installation and repair, while criteria like minimisation of cable length and waste heat as well as positioning and clustering of racks for easy service have also to be satisfied. As some of these criteria are to a certain degree contradictory, compromises have to be found.

This note describes the electronics services of the MDT and CSC chamber systems. For the CSC chambers cooling services are also discussed. The services of the muon trigger chambers (RPCs and TGCs) will be described in a subsequent note. Gas services of the muon detector are described in a different paper.

The main components of electrical services are:

* LV supplies and related cabling for front-end (FE) analog electronics, on-chamber digital electronics and on-chamber equipment of the detector control system (DCS)
* HV distribution modules and cabling to the chambers as well as to the HV generation modules in the USA15 hall
* Optical fibres from on-chamber digital electronics to readout drivers in the USA15 hall
* DCS readout equipment and cabling to measure B-field, local temperature and FE-supply voltage on the chambers.

Together with the spatial distribution of service modules and cable routing the corresponding service cross sections as well as global quantities like average material thickness, dissipated waste heat, cable cost etc. are presented.

This note gives an overview of the present status of the services. It should, however, be noted that changes will be made if performance, simplicity of design or cost effectiveness can be improved.

## 2 Electrical Services for the MDT chambers

The architecture of the services in the barrel corresponds to the projective tower modularity of the MDT chambers as described in the TDR (Section 3.2, Fig. 3-3). For the end-cap, the towers 4-6 are now replaced by wheels 1-3, which correspond essentially to the inner, middle and outer layers of the end-cap. This optimises cable lengths and routing and gives a simpler correspondence between chambers and respective supply racks. A list of chambers and their corresponding towers and wheels is given in Table 1.

The racks for Tower 1-3 and Wheel 1 (EIS, EIL, EES, EEL, BEE) are located on the galleries close to the barrel, while the ones for Wheel 2 (EMS, EML) and Wheel 3 (EOS, EOL) are located close to the chambers at z = \(\pm\) 14 m and z = \(\pm\) 24 m respectively. Figure 1 shows a schematic sketch of this arrangement.

There are 1194 chambers in the MDT system, each one required to be electrically isolated from the others and from the rest of the ATLAS grounding system. Consequently, power supplies (LV or HV) cannot serve more than one chamber. In our implementation there is (per chamber) one LV-supply for the analog frontend electronics and a separate one for the digital readout, while there is one HV-supply per multilayer, resulting in two LV cables and 2 HV cables per chamber.

The architecture of the DAQ also follows the chamber modularity. Signals from the FE electronics are routed via metallic cables to a transceiver unit located at each chamber, converted to optical signals, and transmitted to the readout drivers (RODs) located in the USA15 service hall. The transceivers are called 'concentrator boxes'. It should be noted that this concept differs from the one described in the TDR (Section 5.4.5.1), where the FE signals were directly routed to the respective ROD, which was thought to be located in the cavern (see Section 2.3 below). A schematic view of the present architecture is given in Fig. 2.

Table 1: Allocation of MDT chambers to service towers and wheelsThe service concept presented in this note is based on the assumption that magnetic field strength and radiation levels in the UX-hall ("cavern") allow for the operation of power supplies. To verify the first assumption a magnetic-field setup has been built at CERN and measurements are already under way. To measure the radiation tolerance of critical components and complete units, tests are foreseen at a specialised radiation facility 1 in the coming months.

Footnote 1: A neutron-irradiation facility operated by CEA, France (”PROSPERO”). Typical neutron-fluences per hour are \(10^{12}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\) (1 MeV equivalent Si), accompanied by a \(\gamma\)-dose of 0.1 krad. The ratio of neutron to gamma fluence approximately corresponds to the situation expected for the LHC halls.

### LV supply

#### 2.1.1 Electronics requirements and methods of voltage control

Preamplifiers (ASDs) and TDCs, including low voltage differential signal drivers (LVDS) for the interfacing to DAQ, are mounted on printed circuit boards close to the tube ends (see TDR, section 5.4 and Fig. 5-60) and are considered part of the chamber. The supply voltage of preamps and TDCs is 3.3 V \(\pm\) 0.1 V. Power consumption is 30 mW for preamps and 10 mW for TDCs, giving a total power consumption of 40 mW per tube (channel) which corresponds to a current of 9.1 mA.

Figure 1: Schematic layout of towers, wheels and corresponding racks (side A, top view).

24 racks are required for the readout of the complete MDT system (both sides).

Each MDT chamber is connected to a separate 2 LV power supply by a Cu-cable. Power supplies are located on galleries 3 and 10 at the outer circumference of the ATLAS detector, which yields an average cable length of about 20 m. The maximum number of tubes per chamber is 432, corresponding to a power consumption of 17.3 W (I = 5.3 A), resulting in a voltage drop of \(2\times 0.3\) V and a power loss of 3 W in the cable.

Footnote 2: in the sense of having a separate ground

Voltage regulation is done at the power supply 3. This could be done either by a current-free sensing cable between chamber and power supply or, using DCS, by monitoring the voltage at the FE and adjusting the DCS controlled power supplies accordingly. The latter solution has the advantage of using existing equipment, making sensing cables superfluous and not being prone to self-induced voltage oscillations due to a malfunction of the feedback loop. It therefore is strongly recommended and assumed from here on.

Figure 2: Schematic diagram of the present MDT readout architecture

#### 2.1.2 Modularity of LV power supplies:

Power consumption and currents of all MDT chamber types are listed in Table 11 (appendix). Table 2 details a modularity (for analog and digital LV), where six LV supplies, serving six chambers, are housed in one electronics module and 10 such modules in a crate. The 1194 MDT chambers can therefore be serviced by 20 crates. Columns 3 and 4 give average and maximum power. Using standard values for commercial power supplies and allowing for at least a 20% safety margin for voltage and current w.r.t. to the maximum value the installed power is about three times the power needed.

On the basis of the described layout with 6 channels per module 200 LV modules are necessary for the MDT system for analog as well as digital power.

#### 2.1.3 Cross section of LV cables

The outer diameter of LV-cables for the analog and digital FE is 5.5 mm and 3.7 mm respectively (including insulation), corresponding to 6 mm\({}^{2}\) and 1.5 mm\({}^{2}\) copper cross section. Per MDT chamber this leads to a total area of about 0.6 cm\({}^{2}\) for analog, 0.25 cm\({}^{2}\) for digital and 0.25 cm\({}^{2}\) for alignment, giving a total of 1.1 cm\({}^{2}\) for all LV cables (see Table 4, page 11). We define the cross-section of the cable as the area of the outer square. No packing factor has been applied.

\end{table}

### HV supply

#### 2.2.1 Operating voltage

Chambers are operated in the range of 3.2 to 3.7 kV depending on the type of gas selected. HV components, like connectors and cables, must therefore be qualified to the next higher HV-standard, which is 5 kV 4.

Footnote 4: Standard 5 kV components are specified typically for a test voltage of 12.5 kV DC.

The present concept foresees HV to be generated in USA15 and distributed in UX, close to the chambers. This way cabling is minimised, while HV-generating units are shielded from radiation and accessible during LHC operation. The HV-distribution units in the UX-hall contain voltage and current control and will be interfaced to DCS.

#### 2.2.2 HV currents

The maximum current drawn by a tube under nominal background conditions (with safety factor 5) is estimated to be 0.81 \(\mu\)A. This is based on the assumption that \(<\) 0.6 Cb/cm are accumulated on MDT wires in 10 years of LHC operation (10\({}^{8}\) s). Factors of 1.6 and 2 may be added to account for the peak luminosity at start-of-fill and a possible later LHC-upgrade beyond the nominal luminosity, respectively. A summary is given in Table 3.

Chambers in the inner MDT layer, where background levels are highest, have \(\leq\) 288 tubes, which results in currents \(\leq\) 0.23 mA per chamber at nominal luminosity. The higher tube counts in middle and outer layers are more than compensated by the lower background rates. Therefore the

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c||c|} \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**nominal conditions**} & **fluctuation** & **option** \\ \cline{2-5}  & background & safety factor & peak & \(2\times\) nom. \\  & from MC & for MC & & \(\oplus\) start-of-fill \\ \hline correction factor & 1 & 5 & 1.6 & 2 \\ \hline cumulative factor & 1 & 5 & 8 & 16 \\ \hline Charge/10 years & Cb/cm & 0.12 & 0.6 & 0.6 & 1.2 \\ \hline \multicolumn{5}{|l|}{Currents:} \\ \hline Current/tube 1) & \(\mu\)A & 0.16 & 0.81 & 1.30 & 2.59 \\ \hline Current/layer 2) & \(\mu\)A & 5.832 & 29.16 & 46.66 & 93.31 \\ \hline Current/multilayer & mA & 0.02 & 0.12 & 0.19 & 0.37 \\ \hline Current/chamber & mA & 0.05 & 0.23 & 0.37 & 0.75 \\ \hline Current/HV module (6 chambers) & mA & 0.28 & 1.40 & 2.24 & 4.48 \\ \hline Current/HV crate (10 modules) & mA & 2.80 & 14.00 & 22.39 & 44.79 \\ \hline Power @ 3500 V: & & & & \\ \hline Power/ chamber & W & 0.16 & 0.82 & 1.31 & 2.6 \\ \hline Power/ HV module (6 chambers) & W & 0.98 & 4.90 & 7.84 & 15.7 \\ \hline Power/ HV crate (10 modules) & W & 9.80 & 49.0 & 78.4 & 156.8 \\ \hline Total MDT (1194 chambers) & W & 195.0 & 974.9 & 1559.8 & 3119.6 \\ \hline \end{tabular} \({}^{\dagger}\) _) For EIL.1, 'the hottest chamber' (1=135 cm); 0.6 Cb/cm*135 cm/10\({}^{8}\) s = 0,81 \(\mu\)A_

\end{table}
Table 3: Maximum current and power from HV-supplies for MDT chambersmaximum average current of 0.23 mA and the maximum peak current of 0.37 mA can safely be regarded as an absolute upper limit for all chambers of the MDT detector.

#### 2.2.3 HV-Modularity and cable cross-sections

It is foreseen to have one HV supply cable per multilayer. 12 channels, equivalent to 6 chambers, are supplied by one module and 10 modules fill a crate. 60 chambers are thus served by a single crate, which is the same modularity like the one of LV-power supplies. Consequently, 240 HV modules (with 12 channels each) are needed for the MDT system.

Two HV cables of outer diameter 5.2 mm are serving each MDT chamber, corresponding to an area of about 0.5 cm\({}^{2}\) (see Table 4).

### Daq

In the concept of the DAQ as described in the TDR (Sections 5.4.4 and 5.4.5) up to four TDCs were connected to a local bus called a FE link with a maximum bandwidth of 80 MHz. Up to 32 front-end links were connected to a ROD (readout driver, also called NIMROD in the case of the MDT system) which in turn is connected to a readout board (ROB) via an optical link.

Since the publication of the TDR the location of the RODs has been shifted from the UX hall towards USA15 for better access and radiation protection. This made changes to the architecture necessary, as metallic cables are difficult to operate over distances of 100 m, and optical transmission becomes mandatory. All FE-links of one chamber are now routed into a transceiver unit, called 'concentrator box', where data are serialised and sent via optical fibres to the ROD in USA15 (see Section 2, above, and Fig.2).

The detailed architecture of the chamber readout depends on the expected hit rates, and subsequent bandwidth (BW) on the transfer lines. As rates are subject to strong fluctuations, reasonable safety margins on BW have to be foreseen. Detailed estimates of the BW in different regions of the detector have recently been presented 5. As these numbers a quite new, we give a brief summary of the results.

Footnote 5: Muon FE data flow. Presentation to the Muon workshop in Likithos, 1998. J.W. Chapman et al. and J. Chapman and M. Schneider, UMHE-98-NN, Options for MDT Connections, Draft sept., 12, 1998.

Chambers can deliver hit rates up to 250 kHz per tube 6 (TDR, section 5.4.1). This number is obtained from Monte Carlo calculations and contains a safety factor of 5 (see TDR, p. 42). For each Level-1 trigger the TDC has to accept hits for the full drift time. At a Level-1 rate of \(10^{5}\) and a drift time of 500 ns the TDC has to accept 5% of the incoming hits, which gives \(\,\leq 12.5\) kHz for a single tube and \(\,\leq 300\) kHz for all 24 tubes connected to a TDC. Assuming an average data volume of 48 bits/hit (including all overheads) we obtain a 15 Mbit/s output BW of the TDC, which corresponds to about 20% of the maximum BW of the FE-links (80 Mbit/s). It is concluded that not more than two TDCs can safely be connected to a FE-link, leading to 40% of it's maximum BW. All FE-links of a chamber are routed to the concentrator box. Detailed estimates show that a maximum of three optical links (fibres) are sufficient to route the data to the ROD. There are also two fibres necessary to bring BCO and trigger from the ROD to the concentrator box. This gives a total of five optical links per chamber. We assume that each one has a cross section of about one mm\({}^{2}\), including the outer protection of the fibre, giving a total of five mm\({}^{2}\) per chamber7.

Footnote 6: Considering only readout of the lower threshold. Additional RO of the high threshold will increase this rate by about 50%.

Another result of this work is that 224 RODS are sufficient to service the complete MDT system, where most RODs run at \(<30\%\) of their maximum BW capability (1.2 Gbit/s).

It should be emphasised that this architecture would have to be reviewed if a significant increase of the input BW would occur.

### Dcs

DCS readout of e.g. T- and B-sensors and FE-supply voltages is performed by a standardised readout unit called Local Monitor Board (LMB), which interfaces directly into the CANbus. Up to 127 CAN nodes can be serviced by one CANbus driver, however, a number between 16 and 48 may prove to be more practical. All LMBs connected to a CANbus are referred to as a CAN-"branch".

LMBs are daisy-chained via a single twisted pair and a power cable. The analog input part of the LMB is electrically separated from the digital output part by opto-couplers, leading to a perfect separation of grounds. The typical power consumption of the digital part of the prototype LMBs is 50 mA at 5V.

Figure 4: Location of racks for Wheel 2 (”big wheel”) and proposed numbering of the rack levels. Each level can contain up to two racks. From the maximum number of 16 racks two are presently foreseen for MDT electronics and four for TGC electronics. Two racks are reserved for TGC cooling, while another seven racks are needed for the MDT and TGC gas system. The detailed correspondence between MDT chamber electronics and rack levels is given in Table 12b.

#### 2.5.2 Summary of MDT cable cross sections

The cable cross sections in the MDT system are summarised in Table 4.

#### 2.5.3 Material distribution

The radiation- and collision length of the services is mainly coming from the copper in the cables of the LV supplies, which has a total mass of about 3900 kg for the MDT 8.

Footnote 8: 1200 cables \(\times\) 20 m \(\times\) 2 \(\times\) (0.06 + 2 \(\times\) 0.015) cm\({}^{2}\)\(\times\) 8.96 g/cm\({}^{3}\)(see table 4)

We assume that only 50 % of the estimated cable length of 20 m per chamber runs inside the envelop of the MDT detector, the rest runs along outer circumference, galleries and inside racks, having no influence on tracking. If we distribute thus the "active" Cu-mass of 1950 kg evenly over the area of the chambers of about 5000 m\({}^{2}\)9, we obtain an average load of 0.039 g/cm\({}^{2}\), which corresponds to 0.3 % of a rad. length and 0.04% of a collision length. A particle traversing three layers of the barrel thus sees 0.9 % of a rad. length and about 0.13 % of a collision length. To this number have to be added the contribution from RPCs in the barrel and TGCs and CSCs in the end-cap (see chapter 5, below).

Table 4: Cross section of services between MDT-chambers and racks in the UX- and USA15-Services for the CSC chambers

The arrangement of the CSC chambers follows the eight-fold symmetry of the MDT chambers in the inner wheel. There are two chamber types, large and small, corresponding to EIL and EIS chambers. Each CSC chamber consists out of two identical "chamber modules" of four gas gaps each. The chamber module is thus the equivalent of a MDT-multilayer with four tube-layers. There are 16 chambers (eight large, eight small) on each side of the detector, giving 32 chambers (= 64 "chamber modules") in total. Details of the CSC chamber system are given in the TDR (Sections 1.4.2, 4.2.2.2 and 6). Figures 4.26 and 6.8 of the TDR show the geometrical arrangement of the CSCs on one side of the detector.

The CSC chambers are mounted together with MDT and TGC chambers on the shielding disk between hadronic end-cap calorimeter and the end-cap toroid. In this tightly packed area air convection is strongly reduced and liquid cooling becomes mandatory in order to guarantee a well-defined operation temperature of the CSCs. The total heat dissipated by the CSCs is about 2.3 kW per side, i.e. roughly 150 W per chamber. Details of the cooling system are given in Section 3.2, below.

### CSC electrical services

#### 3.1.1 \(\boldsymbol{LV}\)supply

Basic element of the FE electronics is the ASP (Amplifier-Shaper-Processor), which serves 48 cathode strips at a power consumption of 50 mW/strip, totalling 2.4 W. A chamber module with 960 strips is served by 20 ASPs, corresponding to about 48 W at 3.3 V operating voltage. The CSC readout diagram is shown in Fig. 6-12 of the TDR 10.

Footnote 10: In this figure “chamber” means “chamber module”

The readout of the chambers is assured by "Data Concentrator and Ctrl Cards" (DC3-cards), one for each chamber module, giving a total of 32 DC3-cards per EC. We assume a power requirement of the DC3-cards of about 25 mW per channel at 5V, giving a total of about 0.8 kW of digital LV-power per side. This value is thought to include the consumption of the TTC- and DCS-receiver which are also part of the digital electronics mounted on the chamber. Table 5 gives a summary of power consumption and currents.

#### 3.1.2 \(\boldsymbol{HV}\)supply

To estimate an upper limit for the current drawn by each CSC chamber we extrapolate from the currents of the MDT chambers, discussed in Section 2.2.2, with the following scaling factors:

* factor 1/3 for normal pressure (MDTs: 3 bar)
* same conversion probability for fast neutrons in CSC gas and MDT gas. As the CSC gas contains no hydrogen, the conversion probability should be lower. This assumption is therefore a worst-case estimate.
* average background rate per cm\({}^{3}\) over the volume of the CSC is a factor 10 over the corresponding value for the innermost MDT, due to the location at high pseudorapidity \(\eta\)

Scaling the gas volume of a EIL tube (3000 cm\({}^{3}\), normalised to 1 bar) to the corresponding volume of CSC-chambers (average is about 30000 cm\({}^{3}\)) and applying the factors mentioned above,

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:13]

#### 3.1.4 Modularity of LV- and HV-supplies for the CSC chambers

Table 6 details the CSC supplies. Analog and digital LV power as well as HV-supply need one crate per side. Only four channels per module are foreseen for the analog LV supply because of the 20A current requirement. For the digital LV supplies we have the same modularity like for the MDT LV supplies, while the max. current will be somewhat higher. 16 and 12 modules are needed for analog and digital LV-supply, respectively (total side A & C).

For HV supply we need 12 HV modules of the same type as is used for the MDTs (see section 2.2.2, above).

#### 3.1.5 Summary of CSC services

Table 7 summarises cross sections of electrical and cooling services for the CSC chambers.

### CSC cooling services

The relatively moderate amount of heat produced by the CSC chamber modules (75 W) allows the useof simple uni-phase cooling at temperatures safely above the dew point (which will be about 13 \({}^{\circ}\)C). There are several candidates for the cooling liquid. Apart from de-ionised water there are perfluorcarbons, which are neither corrosive, inflammable nor toxic. Perfluor-n-hexane (C\({}_{6}\)F\({}_{14}\)), for example, has 25% of the specific heat, 45% of the viscosity and 160% of the density of water. The boiling point is 56 \({}^{\circ}\)C 12. Its cost is about 50 CHF/kg.

Footnote 12: C\({}_{6}\)F\({}_{14}\) is the preferred choice of the ATLAS-TRT, see Jan Godlewski et al., CERN PPE/TA1/97-19.

The flow regime is determined by Reynold's number, which depends on density, viscosity, tube radius and coolant velocity, which in turn is determined by the specific heat of the coolant.

In Table 8 we compare the pressure drops in 30 m of tubing of different diameters for water and perfluoro-n-hexane at \(\Delta\)T = 5 \({}^{0}\)C and at heat loads of 75 and 150 W. The table shows that water cooling can be performed at smaller tube diameters than C\({}_{6}\)F\({}_{14}\) cooling, a consequence of the

\({}^{\dagger}\)_Cross-section of a ’wire’ (resp. a cooling pipe) is the area of the outer square; diameter includes insulation_

\({}^{\ddagger}\)_no packing factor has been applied_

\end{table}
Table 7: Electrical and cooling services for CSC chambershigh heat capacity of water. Practical values for the pressure drop are around 200 mbar. Cooling 'chamber modules' and 'chambers' with C\({}_{6}\)F\({}_{14}\) thus requires pipes with 6 and 8 mm inner diameter, respectively.

Table 8: Cooling properties of water and perfluor-n-hexanePower dissipation in the Muon spectrometer

The maximum allowed heat released into the air of the experimental hall by _all_ sources is presently 100 kW. Table 9 summarises the heat sources in the four subsystems, assuming that about 80% of the power produced by the CSCs and by the digital part of the trigger chambers can be removed by cooling.

In spite of this quite optimistic assumption, the total power released in the air by the muon spectrometer is about 72 % of the allowed maximum. It should be noted that Inner Detector and Calorimeters consume a total power of 70 kW and 200 kW, respectively, which leads to an additional important heat load from cable dissipation.

Summary of mass distribution in the Muon system

Extending the simple method of Section 2.5.3 to the whole muon system, we arrive at the numbers presented in Table 10. The "spread out copper layer" belonging to each muon layer has to be thought to be "behind" the chambers (seen from the detector center), as service routing will try to cover the chamber aperture as little as possible.

This picture can still be refined in several aspects. The wheels e.g. are not uniformly covered, but, serviced from the periphery, which leads to a gradual increase of material with the distance from the beam axis. In the barrel the routing of cable bundles in radial direction runs along the voussoirs, where the Cu-mass is relatively unimportant compared with the material already present.

Looking at the overall distribution of material, the contribution of the TGCs is conspicuously high. This is a consequence of the large mass of the TGC cables (see Table 9), which in turn is a consequence of the high channel count and high power consumption per channel. If the material budget in this area proves to be critical, a smaller cable cross sections could be foreseen in the area of the chambers. The option of aluminium cables in this area could also be explored, as it reduces the radiation probability by more than a factor of 10 compared to copper cables (at equal conductivity).
