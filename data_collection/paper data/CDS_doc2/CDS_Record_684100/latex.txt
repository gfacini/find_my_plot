**Abstract**

This note describes the comparison between full and fast simulation of the ATLAS detector for events with Higgs boson decaying to \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\). The full simulation and reconstruction is carried out using the program SLUG-DICE-ATRECON [1]. The fast simulation is obtained using the ATLFAST [2] package.

The Higgs boson events decaying through the channel H/A \(\to\) t\(\overline{\mathrm{t}}\)\(\to\)\(bl\nu\)\(b\)\(\bar{b}\)\(\bar{}\)\(j\) with \(m_{A}=400\) GeV have been generated and processed using both simulation programs.

A good agreement between the two simulation packages is found for the acceptance of the kinematic cuts and in the reconstructed quantities involved in them. The \(m_{t}\) and \(m_{A}\) mass resolutions are in reasonable agreement, with the full simulation predicting resolutions which are 10-20% worse than those from the fast simulation. The top mass peak is reconstructed around 175 GeV with an accuracy of about 1%.

**1. Introduction**

The decay channel \({\rm H/A}\to{\rm t}{\overline{\rm t}}\to bl\nu{\bar{b}}{\bar{j}}j\) has been already studied in a previous note [3] using a fast detector simulation. It was shown that for a 400 GeV Higgs boson mass, background and signal peak coincide in the same invariant mass region and the signal extraction is therefore difficult to perform but for \(m_{H}=370\) GeV a clear signal can be extracted. However the presented below analysis is useful as a benchmark for the ATLAS detector performances in the reconstruction of quantities used in the physics events.

The full simulation is always needed to study effects due to noise, calibration and intercalibration of calorimeters, detailed showers development, pile-up, cracks, and to provide parametrisation for fast simulation. The GEANT package has been used to simulate in detail the detector characteristics and performances. The simulation program framework is provided by a package called SLUG (Simulation for LHC Using GEANT) [1], which gives the basic infrastructure for handling ZEBRA banks. It also provides a set of facilities for dealing with event generation, detector geometry and simulation, event merging for pile-up studies, together with stubs for user-defined routines to gain acces to every step in the simulation process and tools for managing histograms and n-tuples.

However the full simulation is largely time consuming, therefore in some cases it is necessary to dispose of a detector fast simulation.

Fast simulation is an intermediate step between a simple parton-level analysis of the event topology, which in general yields to too much optimistic results for physics processes at hadron colliders, and a very sophisticated and high CPU-time intensive full detector simulation and reconstruction. This kind of approach is needed for quick and approximate estimates of signal and background rates for specific channels. In addition, fast simulation and reconstruction is the only practical tool for a high-statistics studies of complex background processes. A complete package for fast detector simulation of ATLAS and physics analysis has been implemented: ATLFAST [2]. It can be used for fast simulation of signal and background processes, including the most crucial detector aspects: jet reconstruction in the calorimeters, momentum/energy smearing for leptons and photons, magnetic field effects and missing transverse energy evaluation.

This note contains a first part which compares the acceptances and the quantities involved in kinematic cuts for full and fast simulation. The next part describes and compares three proposed method to correct reconstructed quantities for physics effects related with the parton fragmentation. The last part is dedicated to the comparison of the resolution and Higgs mass reconstruction between full and fast simulation events in the case of low luminosity performance (\(3\;10^{4}\;\;pb^{-1}\)).

**2. The H/A \(\rightarrow\) t\(\overline{\mbox{t}}\)\(\rightarrow\)**_bl\(\nu\)bjj_** decay channel**

The strategy used to identify t\(\overline{\mbox{t}}\) decays from H/A consists in searching for WWbb final states. One top decay, t \(\rightarrow\) Wb, is required to be followed by the semileptonic decay of the W-boson, W \(\rightarrow\)_l\(\nu\)_, giving an isolated lepton to trigger the experiment. The second W-boson is required to decay hadronically, W \(\rightarrow\) jj. This final topology consists of one isolated lepton and four reconstructed jets originated from b-quarks and hadronic W decay (W \(\rightarrow\)jj). The Higgs signal appears as peak in the invariant t\(\overline{\mbox{t}}\) mass distribution. The detailed discussion on signal and background determination can be found in [3].

Signal events were generated with PYTHIA 5.7 and simulated with full event simulation (GEANT). The comparison between full simulation and ATLFAST has been done for just one mass value: \(m_{A}\) = 400 GeV.

The sample used for full and fast simulation is the same sample of signal events (20000 events, Run Numbers 65801-66000), generated with PYTHIA with the same datacard file. The events were simulated with electronic noise but not taking into account the effect from minimum bias. The leptons and missing energy are reconstructed using only the fast simulation.

In both cases events passing the following filter cuts were analysed:

\(\bullet\) Two reconstructed jets labelled as b-jets with \(p_{T}\)\(>\) 40 GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) (from t \(\rightarrow\) Wb). The expected efficiency for b-jets identification is \(\varepsilon_{b}\) = 60% (50%) at low (high) luminosity with \(\varepsilon_{c}\) = 10% and \(\varepsilon_{j}\) = 1% respectively.

\(\bullet\) Isolated lepton within \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{T}\)\(>\) 20 GeV for electrons and muons at low luminosity.

\(\bullet\) Two reconstructed jets with \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{T}\)\(>\) 40 GeV (from W \(\rightarrow\) jj).

**2.1 Comparison of the acceptances**

Figure 1 shows the isolated lepton multiplicity from full and fast simulation without any further cuts but \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{T}>\) 20 GeV.

Figure 2 shows the jet multiplicity from full and fast simulation without further cuts but \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{T}>\) 40 GeV cuts. Figure 3 shows the same plots for b-labelled jets.

Table 1 shows the acceptance for each selection separately (leptons, jets, bjets). The lepton acceptance for full and fast simulation is very similar because in both cases we have taken the lepton from fast simulation. This is due to the fact that isolated electrons are treated as jets in ATRECON and some jets in full simulation are just electrons. The same procedure is followed in ATLFAST, but these jets are remove and replaced by electrons.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Acc. & electrons & muons & leptons & jets & bjets \\ \hline Fast & 0.90 & 0.77 & 0.88 & 0.41 & 0.62 \\ \hline Full & 0.89 & 0.74 & 0.85 & 0.49 & 0.59 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure 3: \(b\)-labelled jets multiplicity from full (top) and fast (bottom) simulation without cuts (left) and with cuts (right), \(m_{H\,/A}\) = 400 GeV.

Figure 4 shows the comparison between the acceptance for different topologies after kinematic cuts (mentioned before) applied sequentially using full simulation and ATLFAST for \(m_{A}\) = 400 GeV. Each category is defined as:

\(\bullet\) jets from light quarks: \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{T}>40\) GeV;

\(\bullet\) leptons: \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{T}>20\) GeV for electrons and muons;

\(\bullet\) b-jets: \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{T}>40\) GeV.

The acceptance for each cut is similar for the two types of simulation. A larger discrepancy is observed for multiplicity from light quarks. This is partially due to the implementation of the jets energy threshold in both simulation [4].

In ATLFAST: the transverse energy of all stable particles, except neutrinos, muons and SUSY LSP, are added up in the calorimeter cells with granularity \(0.1\times 0.1\) for \(|\eta|<3\), \(0.2\times 0.2\) for \(3<|\eta|<5\). All calorimeter cells with transverse energy greater than the selected seed energy (1.5 GeV) are taken as possible initiators of a cluster, in order of decreasing \(E_{T}\). They are used to verify if the total \(E_{T}\) summed over all cells in a cone of radius \(\Delta R\)=0.4 exceeds the minimum required threshold for a reconstructed cluster (10 GeV). Clusters with transverse energy above threshold (15 GeV) are accepted as jets (see [5] for more details).

In full simulation for A/H \(\rightarrow\) t\(\overline{\rm t}\) events, the cone algorithm has been used (starting from the combined calorimeter matrix, where the energies of calorimeter towers with granularity 0.1 \(\times\) 0.1 are stored) with a seed = 1 GeV and a cone radius of 0.4. A sliding-window algorithm is used, looking for local energy maxima in a \(3\times 3\) cell window, by scanning the whole combined calorimeter matrix. If a window contains a local maximum and its total energy exceeds 2 GeV the cell cluster is used to define a jet candidate. Only clusters with transverse energy exceeding 12-15 GeV are accepted as jets. For each candidate the kinematic variables are calculated using information from a \(9\times 9\) cell window with the same center as the selected cluster (for more details see [6]).

After all cuts have, the final acceptance calculated using both methods are in good agreement.

The most significant detector effects originate in the non-compesanting [6] ATLAS calorimeter and in the energy loss in dead material. These effects depend on \(\eta\) since the amount and position of dead material along the shower depend on \(\eta\). To correct these effects we have used a calorimetric jet calibration [7]. This calibration method is called in the TDR [6] the "Benchmark approach". It provides the "hadronic scale" and is also useful to improve the energy resolution. But this method is not providing the ultimate performace. In the future also other methods, like for example the H1 weighting [8] will be available and fully parameterised in the full \(\eta\) range. The physics effects involved in the parton fragmentation and final state radiation are not conected by this calibration method.

**2.2 Comparison of quantities involved in the kinematic cuts**

In figures 5 and 6 the main distributions involving kinematic parameters (\(p_{T}\) and \(|\eta|\)), as obtained from the full and fast simulation, are shown for signal events with \(m_{\,H/A}=4\,00\) GeV. In the case of full simulation, reconstructed jets are calibrated with the calorimetric calibration [7]. The mean and r.m.s. values of the distributions are in good agreement for the two simulation packages. The transverse momentum mean value is greater in the full than in the fast simulation case. This is due to the fact that in full simulation the reconstructed momentum of the jets is slightly overestimated and also to the addition of the electronic noise. In the fast simulation the jets are not recalibrated. In both cases calibration for the physics effects is done in a separate step in a consistent way.

The relative difference in pseudorapidity, \(\Delta\eta/\eta\) and in transverse momentum, \(\Delta p_{T}/p_{T}\) for quantities reconstructed with fast and full simulations are shown in figure 7 for light quarks and b-jets. The accuracy of the comparison is good and show much larger tails and worse resolution for \(p_{T}\) than for \(\eta\). It is also resonable that there is better agreement between light jets than between b-jets.

**2.3 Description of three proposed recalibration methods**

The recalibration factors, described in this section, are introduced to correct for the physics effects involved in the parton fragmentation, Final State Radiation (FSR), etc, as explained below.

A jet is reconstructed as the measurable energy deposition resulting from a parton produced in the hard interaction. When a jet is reconstructed, not all particles produced in the fragmentation can be collected. The magnetic field sweeps out the low \(p_{T}\) particles, but the area of the calorimeter where the energy is collected can not be arbitrarily large for various reasons: optimisation of signal to noise (electronic noise or minimum bias), another jet closed-by. So usually the reconstructed jet is restricted to a _cone_. To go back to the initial parton energy, one has to correct for the fragmentation effects and out of cone losses. This correction depends on the physics process under consideration: the amount of Final State Radiation or the type of the initiating parton (light quark b-quark).

The following three methods were used to correct these effects: "Z+jet (average)", "recalibration with neighbour jet" and "Z+jet (mean)" method. The comparison between the different physics calibration methods is shown after the jets reconstructed with full simulation are corrected with the calorimetric calibration [7].

**2.3.1 Z+jet (average) method**

The jet momenta are recalibrated using a calibration factor \(K_{jet}=\)\(<\)\(p_{T}^{\mbox{\tiny parton}}\)/\(p_{T}^{jet}\)\(>\), where, \(p_{T}^{\mbox{\tiny parton}}\) is the transverse momentum of the parton initiating the jet (before FSR). Figure 8 shows these calibration factors as a function of \(p_{T}^{jet}\) for b-jets and light quarks and for fast and full simulation, respectively. A fit is made to obtain the recalibration factors. These factors are larger for b-quarks than for light quarks, as expected.

The recalibration factors should be larger than 1.0. At high-\(p_{T}\) (\(>\) 80 GeV) unphysical values of recalibration coefficients (\(<\) 1) are observed because the high-\(p_{T}\) jets come from high-\(p_{T}\) W's. As a consequence, the two jets tend to overlap.

**2.3.2 Recalibration with neighbour jets method**

The recalibration factor (figure 8) is quite large for low-\(p_{T}\) jets because the out-of-cone energy losses are higher for low-\(p_{T}\) events and the associated jets usually lose a lot of energy in FSR. An idea to improve the recalibration factors could be to add neighbour jets. The effect of the FSR process is shown in figure 9.

Events with low-\(p_{T}\) b-jets come from b-quarks which loos a significant part of their energy after FSR. Usually most of this energy is taken by gluons next to the b-jet. The method consists in taking a group of jets (usually one!) in a larger cone around b-jets and treat them as a single jet. One should add their energies but also correct their direction.

In figure 10, we compare the calibration factors for the "Z+jet (average)" method. The fitted function is used to recalibrate jets.

#### 2.3.3 Z+jet (mean) method

This method is similar to the Z+jet (average) method described previously. Instead of taking the average value of the \(P_{T}^{quark}/P_{T}^{jet}\) distribution, the mean of the peak position is used to extract the calibration factors. The main objection against previous recalibration was the \(P_{T}^{jet}/P_{T}^{quark}\) was not peaked at 1 after jet detector effect calibrations.

Figure 11 shows the \(P_{T}^{jet}/P_{T}^{quark}\) distributions for the b-jets and light quarks for several \(P_{T}^{jet}\) ranges and using the Z+jet (average) method. The distributions for the (0-200 GeV) range are peaked around of 0.95.

So the first step is to obtain the \(P_{T}^{jet}/P_{T}^{quark}\) distribution (after calorimetric calibration) being peaked at 1 (with some tails). This procedure is described in the TDR [9] as the Z+jet (mean) method.

Figure 12 shows the calibration factors as a function of \(p_{T}^{jet}\) for the b-jets and for the light jets using the Z+jet (mean) method.

Figure 13 shows the \(P_{T}^{jet}/P_{T}^{quark}\) distributions for the b-jets and light jets for several \(P_{T}^{jet}\) ranges and using the Z+jet (mean) method. The distributions for the (0-200 GeV) range are peaked around of 0.99. Now the \(P_{T}^{jet}/P_{T}^{quark}\) is peaked in 1 with an accuracy about 1% (ATLAS precision on the mass scale [9]). In the (50-70 GeV) and (70-90 GeV) ranges, the distributions show tails on the right side. \(P_{T}^{jet}\) is larger than \(P_{T}^{quark}\), because the high-\(p_{T}\) jets come from high-\(p_{T}\) W's. As consequence the two jets tend to overlap.

Figure 14 shows the \(P_{T}^{jet}/P_{T}^{quark}\) distribution for the b-jets after jet calibration and Z+jet (mean) calibrations. In figure 15 the equivalent plots for light quarks are shown. We can observe the jet calibration related with the detector effects and with the physics effects. Therefore it is necessary to correct both, the physics (Z+jet method) and the detector effects (calorimetric calibration).

**2.4 Reconstruction of the H/A \(\rightarrow\) t\(\overline{\mbox{t}}\)**

Several algorithms for reconstruction of the invariant mass of the t\(\overline{\mbox{t}}\) pair have been studied. The detail description of the algorithms used for the reconstruction have been presented in previous note [3].

The procedure for the reconstruction of top-quark pairs consists in taking all jjb and bl\(\nu\) pairs. Events with both \(m_{\,jjb(bl\nu)}=m_{top}\pm 30\) GeV are retained, and the \(m_{\,jjb(bl\nu)}\) are rescaled to \(m_{top}\). For each event only one combination \((\mbox{jjb})(\mbox{bl}\nu)\), giving the best value of \(\chi^{2}=\left(m_{bl\nu}-m_{t}\right)^{2}/\sigma_{bl\nu}+\left(m_{\,jjb}-m_{t} \right)^{2}/\sigma_{jjb}\) is selected.

#### 2.4.1 Z+jet (average) method

For the single top-quark reconstruction in the hadronic channel, all possible jj combinations are examined; the distribution of their invariant mass \(m_{jj}\) is shown in figure 16 for the fast and full simulation. The mass peak is around 80 GeV (\(p_{T}\)\(>\)40 GeV) and u-jets with this energy may not need to be recalibrate (the recalibration coefficient isFigure 11: \(P_{T}^{jet}/P_{T}^{quark}\) distributions for light quarks (left) and \(d\) for b-jets one (right plot) for several \(P_{T}^{jet}\) ranges and using the Z+jet (average) method.

close to 1 for energy greater than 40 GeV). A more pronounced peak is observed in the fast than in the full simulation case, this is because the resolution is worse in the full than in the fast simulation and the combinatorial background is larger for the full simulation. For each candidate with \(m_{jj}=80\)\(\pm\) 20 GeV the jj four momentum is rescaled to impose the constraint \(m_{jj}=m_{W}\); the two possible jjb combinations are considered. Out of all possible jjb combinations the one which minimises the value of \(\chi^{2}=(m_{jjb}-m_{t})^{2}\) is chosen. Figure 17 shows the reconstructed invariant mass under the last condition for fast and full simulation. The resulting \(m_{W}\) resolutions were 18.4 and 21.7 GeV for fast and full simulation, respectively. In the full simulation case, the resolution for the \(m_{W}\) has been obtained selecting the candidates with \(m_{jj}\) = 80 \(\pm\) 20 GeV and then doing the fit. The \(m_{jjb}\) invariant mass resolutions were \(\sigma\) = 18.7 GeV and \(\sigma\) = 22.7 GeV for fast and full simulation, respectively.

The reconstruction of the semileptonic channel W \(\to l\nu\) is limited by the impossibility of reconstructing the neutrino four-momentum. The transverse components of the neutrino momentum (\(p_{x}^{\nu}\), \(p_{y}^{\nu}\)) are recovered from the components of the missing energy (\(p_{x}^{miss}\), \(p_{y}^{miss}\)) in the event, while the information on the longitudinal component (\(p_{z}^{\nu}\)) is lost because of the large amount of energy escaping down the beampipe. The component \(p_{z}^{\nu}\) can be extracted solving the equation (1) for the W-boson mass, which requires the reconstructed neutrino and lepton system to form the W-mass.

\[m_{W}^{2}=(E^{\nu}+E^{l})^{2}-(p_{x}^{\nu}+p_{x}^{l})^{2}-(p_{y}^{\nu}+p_{y}^{l })^{2}-(p_{z}^{\nu}+p_{z}^{l})^{2} \tag{1}\]Figure 13: \(P_{T}^{jet}/P_{T}^{quark}\) distributions for light quarks (left) and \(d\) for b-jets one (right plot) for several \(P_{T}^{jet}\) ranges and using the Z+jet (mean) method.

where \(p_{x}^{\nu}=p_{x}^{miss}\), \(p_{y}^{\nu}=p_{y}^{miss}\) and the neutrino is assumed massless.

For events containing a reconstructed \(W\to l\nu\) candidate, each of the four possible b\(\,l\nu\) combinations is considered and the one which best reconstructs the top-quark mass, i.e. which minimises the value \(\chi^{2}=(m_{b\nu}-m_{t})^{2}\), is chosen as the top-quark candidate. Figure 18 shows the resulting \(m_{b\nu}\) distributions for fast and full simulation. In both cases we have taken the lepton and neutrino from fast simulation. Resolutions of \(\sigma=11.9\) and \(13.0\) GeV are obtained for fast and full simulation, respectively.

The procedure for the reconstruction of top-quark pairs consists in taking all possible _jj_ combinations and applying the W-mass constraint, then all possible \(l\nu\) combinations plus two b-jets are considered and a loop over (_jjb_, \(bl\nu\)) pairs is performed. After, the best combinations, which minimise the value of the equation (2) are taken into account.

\[\chi^{2}=\left(m_{jjb}-m_{t}\right)^{2}/\sigma_{jjb}+\left(m_{bl\nu}-m_{t} \right)^{2}/\sigma_{bl\nu} \tag{2}\]

Fig. 19 shows the distributions of \(m_{bl\nu}\) and \(m_{jjb}\) for full and fast simulation selected as optimal for the top quark pairs reconstruction inside the chosen mass window and for the low-luminosity b-tagging performance.

Once both top-quarks are reconstructed, their 4-vectors can be rescaled by applying a constraint on \(m_{t}\) before reconstructing \(m_{H/A}\). Figure 20 shows the \(m_{tt}\) mass

distribution for fast and full simulation and for \(m_{A}=400\) GeV. The expected resolution is \(\sigma=16.7\) and \(24.0\) GeV for fast and full simulation, respectively.

In summary, the two simulation packages are in good agreement for the cuts acceptance. The \(m_{W}\), \(m_{jjb}\) and \(m_{tt}\) resolutions are in reasonable agreement (in comparison with other similar studies [9]), with the full simulation predicting resolutions which are 10-25% worse than those from the fast simulation. In the case \(m_{W\nu}\) this agreement is too optimistic because both \(W\to l\nu\) have been reconstructed with the fast simulation.

#### 2.4.2 Neighbour jets method

We can reconstruct the invariant mass distributions and to see the difference in the distribution shape for the Z+jet (average) method and for the method which adds the neighbour jets.

After reconstructing the W \(\to\) jj candidates, as described in the previous sections, the obtained distributions are the same due to the fact that only the recalibration factors of b-jets have been used. Figure 21 shows the reconstructed t \(\to\) jjb invariant mass with neighbour jets added for fast and full simulation. The \(m_{jjb}\) invariant mass resolutions are 16.9 GeV and 21.7 GeV for fast and full simulation, respectively.

Figure 22 shows the resulting \(m_{b\nu}\) distributions for fast and full simulation with neighbour jets added. The resolution is \(\sigma=11.2\) GeV and 13.9 GeV for fast and full simulation, respectively. The reconstructed lepton and the missing energy (neutrino) have been taken from fast simulation in both cases.

On figure 23 one can see the \(m_{tt}\) distribution for the method with neighbour jets added for fast and full simulation. The \(m_{tt}\) invariant mass resolutions are 19.3 GeV and 21.2 GeV for fast and full simulation, respectively.

The same behaviour is observed in the mass resolution, the \(m_{jjb}\) and \(m_{tt}\) mass resolutions are in reasonable agreement [9], with the full simulation predicting resolutions which are 10-20% worse than those from the fast simulation.

The resolution improves adding the neighbour jets (see Table 2). For example, the \(m_{tt}\) invariant mass resolution is 21.2 GeV for the neighbour jets added and 24.0 GeV for the Z+jet (average) method in the full simulation case.

**2.4.3 Z+jet (mean) method**

We can reconstruct the invariant mass distributions and to see the differences in the distribution shapes for the Z+jet (average) and the Z+jet (mean) method.

The procedure is:

\(\bullet\) for fast simulation we use the prametrization obtained with "Z+jet"(mean) method;

\(\bullet\) for full simulation we use the calorimetric jet calibration provided by the ATLAS calorimeter and then we apply Z+jet (mean) parametrization (the same as above).

The algorithm for reconstructing the invariant masses is the same that in the previous sections. Figure 24 shows the reconstructed invariant mass for the hadronic channel W \(\rightarrow\) jj. The resulting \(m_{\,W}\) resolutions were 13.7 and 15.2 GeV for fast and full simulation, respectively. In the full simulation case, the resolution for the \(m_{\,W}\) has been obtained selecting the candidates with \(m_{\,jj}=80\pm 20\) GeV and then doing the fit.

Figure 25 shows the reconstructed t \(\rightarrow\) jjb invariant mass using the parametrization obtained with Z+jet (mean) method for fast and full simulation. The \(m_{jjb}\) invariant mass resolutions are 13.9 GeV and 21.1 GeV for fast and full simulation, respectively.

Figure 26 shows the resulting \(m_{\,R\nu}\) distributions for fast and full simulations. The

Figure 27 shows the \(m_{tt}\) mass distribution for fast and full simulation. The expected resolution is 17.2 GeV and 17.5 GeV for fast and full simulation, respectively.

The \(m_{W}\), \(m_{jjb}\) and \(m_{tt}\) resolutions are in reasonable agreement (in comparison with other similar studies), with the full simulation predicting resolutions which are 10-20% worse than those from the fast simulation.

In summary, the Z+jet (mean) method provides the distribution of \(P_{T}^{jet}/P_{T}^{quark}\) peaked at 1, the invariant mass resolutions improves (see Table 3) and before to apply the method the invariant mass distribution for \(bl\nu\) channel was not well centered around \(m_{top}\) (175 GeV) in the full simulation case. Using Z+jet (mean) method we are getting 1% (accuracy of our jet energy scale for ATLAS) agreement on the position of the mass peak.

## 3 Conclusions

The main conclusion of the present study is that the predictions from the two simulation packages are in good agreement for the kinematic cuts acceptance and the quantities involved in the analysis. The \(m_{W}\), \(m_{jjb}\) and \(m_{tt}\) mass resolutions are in reasonable agreement, with the full simulation predicting resolutions which are 10-20% worse than those from the fast simulation.

Taking a group of jets (usually one!) in a cone around b-jets an treating them as single jets, the obtained recalibration coefficients are better than using the Z+jet (average) method. However, the \(P_{T}^{jet}/P_{T}^{quark}\) distribution are not peaked at 1 after calibration and consequently the invariant mass distribution for \(bl\nu\) is not well centered around top mass.

Using the method called calibration with Z+jet (mean) events we obtain the \(P_{T}^{jet}/P_{T}^{quark}\) distribution (after calorimetric calibration) peaked at 1 (with some tails), the 1% agreement on the position of the \(bl\nu\) mass peak is reached and the invariant mass resolutions have been improved.

The two simulations can be used in a complementary way to study physics channels: full simulation has to be used to check in detail the detector performances (and to provide parametrisation for fast simulation), fast simulation can be used as a cross-check for full simulation reconstruction code and the algorithms used there and also for the production of large statistics samples of events for the physics analysis.
