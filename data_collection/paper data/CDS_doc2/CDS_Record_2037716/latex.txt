**Commissioning of the reconstruction of hadronic tau lepton decays in ATLAS using \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV**

The ATLAS Collaboration

**Abstract**

As part of the commissioning of the reconstruction and identification of hadronic tau lepton decays in ATLAS for Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider, a set of studies is presented. The studies are based on two datasets taken with \(pp\) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV during 2015, which correspond to integrated luminosities of 15 nb\({}^{-1}\) at low instantaneous luminosity and 6.6 pb\({}^{-1}\) at high instantaneous luminosity. Some of the basic kinematic observables of reconstructed tau candidates and observables used in the identification of hadronic tau lepton decays were measured and compared to predictions from simulation.

## 1 Introduction

Between June 9 and June 14 2015, the ATLAS detector [1] recorded proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of \(13\TeV\). Two datasets were recorded: one at low instantaneous luminosity (average number of interactions per bunch crossing, \(\mu<1\), called low-\(\mu\)) corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \(15\,\mathrm{nb}^{-1}\) and one at high instantaneous luminosity (\(\langle\mu\rangle\approx 20\), called high-\(\mu\)) corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \(6.6\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\). Events in the low-\(\mu\) sample are preselected using a minimum-bias trigger, and are comprised primarily by soft interactions. Samples of \(W(\rightarrow\mu\nu)\)+jets, dijets, \(Z(\rightarrow\mu\mu)\)+jets, \(Z(\rightarrow ee)\)+jets and \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\) events are selected from the high-\(\mu\) dataset, using muon, electron and jet triggers. The data are used to commission the reconstruction and identification of hadronically decaying tau leptons in the ATLAS experiment. The charged and neutral hadrons stemming from the tau lepton decay make up the visible decay products of the tau lepton, and are in the following referred to as \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\). The kinematics and identification observables of reconstructed \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidates in the data are compared with simulation. While the \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidates in the samples originate predominantly from quark- and gluon-initiated jets (with the exception of the \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\) sample), the comparisons still provide a good check of the quality of the modelling of the \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) reconstruction in the simulation.

This note is structured as follows: Details of the event samples and the reconstruction of physics objects are given in Sec. 2. Comparisons between the data and simulation in each of event samples are given in Sec. 3. Section 4 concludes.

## 2 Event samples

To ensure good data quality, the inner-detector tracking systems, calorimeters and muon spectrometer are required to be fully operational and data-quality criteria on the calorimeter are applied. Events are required to have at least one primary vertex.

The low-\(\mu\) data are compared to simulated samples consisting of single-, double- and non-diffractive minimum bias events. The high-\(\mu\) data are compared to simulated samples of \(W(\rightarrow\mu\nu)\)+jets, \(Z(\rightarrow\mu\mu)\)+jets, \(Z(\rightarrow ee)\)+jets, \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau,t\bar{t}\) and multijet events. Details regarding the simulation of the samples can be found in Tab. 1. All generated events are propagated through a detailed Geant4 simulation [2] of the ATLAS detector and subdetector-specific digitisation algorithms [3] and are reconstructed with the same algorithms as the data. For the simulated samples that are compared to the high-\(\mu\) data, pileup is simulated by overlaying minimum-bias interactions on the generated events. The resulting events are reweighted according to the \(\mu\) distribution in the data.

The reconstruction and identification of \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidates is described in detail in Ref. [25]. The energy calibration and the tau identification based on Boosted Decision Trees have been updated for the expected conditions in \(13\TeV\) collisions. In this note, \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidates are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) (excluding the region \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\)). Unless otherwise stated, the dedicated jet, electron and muon discriminants are not applied. In the \(W(\rightarrow\mu\nu)\)+jets, \(Z(\rightarrow\mu\mu)\)+jets and \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\) analyses, \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidates are required to have one or three associated tracks in the _core region_ (\(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}<0.2\)) around the \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) axis, as this is most similar to the selection used in searches and measurements. For the minimum bias and dijets analyses, no track selection is applied in order to investigate the modelling for higher multiplicities. Muons are reconstructed by combining an inner-detector track with a track from the muon spectrometer [26]. They are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>22\GeV\)and \(|\eta|<2.5\). Corrections to the muon trigger and reconstruction efficiencies derived from the data are applied to the simulated samples. Electrons are reconstructed by matching clustered energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter to tracks reconstructed in the inner-detector [27]. They must satisfy likelihood-based identification criteria and must have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>15\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.47\) (excluding the region \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\)). Corrections to the electron trigger, reconstruction and identification efficiencies derived from the data are applied to the simulated samples. Muons and electrons are considered isolated if they pass criteria that require a low amount of nearby activity in the calorimeter and tracking system. Geometric overlap of objects with \(\Delta R<0.2\) is resolved by selecting only one of the overlapping objects in the following order of priority: muons, electrons, \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidates. The missing transverse momentum, with magnitude \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), is calculated from the vector sum of the transverse momenta of all reconstructed electrons, muons, \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) and jets in the event, as well as a term for the remaining activity in the calorimeter [28].

## 3 Results

In this section, basic quantities of the reconstructed \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidates from the proton-proton collisions are compared to the simulation. As the \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidates in the samples originate predominantly from quark- and gluon-initiated jets (with the exception of the \(Z\to\tau\tau\) sample), the comparisons are affected not only by the detector modelling, but also by the jet fragmentation model used in the simulation. Despite this, as the vast majority of particles in jets are charged and neutral pions, as in hadronic tau decays, the comparisons still provide a good check of the quality of the modelling of the tau reconstruction in the simulation. To mitigate effects that lead to an overall mismodelling of the normalisation of the simulated samples, in each analysis other than the \(Z\to\tau\tau\) analysis, the total expected contribution from simulation is normalised to that of the data. During this procedure, the relative contribution from each simulated sample is unaltered. The uncertainties shown in the figures are statistical only; systematic uncertainties arising from the limited knowledge of the detector response (such as the efficiency to reconstruct tracks and clustered energy deposits or the four-momentum response of these objects) have not been evaluated and their impact is not taken into account.

The investigated properties of \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidates and of clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter (EM clusters) used to identify neutral pions in \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) decays are listed below. The variables are not corrected for pileup effects in these comparisons. The EM clusters are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>3\GeV\) to reduce the effect of poorly-modelled low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) neutral particles. Further details can be found in Ref. [25].

### Minimum-bias

While the number of tau-leptons in the momentum range relevant to the ATLAS physics program is expected to be negligible in the low-\(\mu\) dataset, comparison of these data with simulation is essential to the commissioning of the reconstruction and identification of hadronic tau-lepton decays.

For this analysis, low-\(\mu\) events are required to pass data-quality requirements related to beam and detector conditions and to have at least one primary vertex. When more than one vertex is present, the vertex with the largest scalar sum of the transverse momenta squared of the associated tracks is taken to be the leading primary vertex. Events with a second (subleading) primary vertex having four or more associated tracks are vetoed. Reconstructed \(\tau_{\text{had-vis}}\) candidates are selected from surviving low-\(\mu\) events and are required to pass the kinematic constraints outlined in Sec. 2. A total of \(4.1\times 10^{5}\)\(\tau_{\text{had-vis}}\) candidates are selected.

In the following, comparisons between the data and simulation are presented for basic kinematic, track and identification variables associated with hadronically decaying tau leptons and their constituents.

Figure 1 shows the transverse momentum (\(p_{\rm T}\)) and the pseudorapidity (\(\eta\)) of reconstructed \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidates. In general, reasonably good agreement is observed between the data and simulation.

Figure 2 shows \(N_{\rm track}\), \(N_{\rm track}^{\rm iso}\) and \(q\) of \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidates. Small differences between the data and simulation are observed, but it is likely that they are predominantly caused by mismodelling of the jet fragmentation.

The distributions of a selection of variables used to identify and discriminate \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) from QCD-jets are shown in Fig. 3. The increased number of events at zero in \(m_{\rm track}\) and \(\Delta R_{\rm max}\) comes from \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidates with fewer than two tracks. Small differences between the data and simulation are observed but the overall modelling remains reasonably good given the expected impact of jet fragmentation modelling.

Figure 4 shows \(\lambda_{\rm centre}\), \(\langle r^{2}\rangle\) and \(f_{\rm core,EM1}\) of clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter used to identify neutral pions in \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidates. As with the tau identification variables, a small discrepancy is observed between the data and simulation but the overall modelling remains reasonable.

### Dijets

In order to study the performance of the tau identification algorithms against jet rejection in the high-\(\mu\) data, a sample of events with an expected large number of jets has been collected by means of a single jet trigger with a threshold of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>260\GeV\). The events are required to contain two reconstructed \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidates passing the selection criteria described in Sec. 2. The leading-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidate is required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>300\GeV\). Finally, to minimise contributions from events with more than two jets, a balance between the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the leading and sub-leading \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidates of \((p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{lead}}-p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{sub-lead}})/(p_{ \mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{lead}}+p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{sub-lead}})<0.3\) is required. A total of \(1.0\times 10^{4}\)\(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidates (including leading and sub-leading candidates) are selected.

The kinematics and track multiplicities of the \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidates are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. Input variables to the tau identification are shown in Fig. 7. The comparisons show reasonably good agreement over a large range of \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidate \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and track multiplicity, especially given the potential impact from the jet fragmentation.

### \(W(\to\mu\nu)\)+jets

\(W\)+jets events, where one jet is mis-identified as a hadronically decaying \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidate, are a major background for \(Z\to\tau\tau\) and \(H\to\tau\tau\) studies in which one tau decays leptonically (\(\tau_{\rm lep}\)) and the other decays hadronically (\(\tau_{\rm had}\)). A precise study of \(W\)+jets processes is crucial for the tag and probe analyses with \(Z\to\tau\tau\) events and searches for \(H\to\tau\tau\) in the \(\tau_{\rm lep}\tau_{\rm had}\) final state. A study of \(W\)+jets enriched events that contain one muon and at least one \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidate is described below.

Events are selected using a trigger that requires an isolated muon with \(p_{\rm T}>24\GeV\). The events must contain exactly one reconstructed muon with \(p_{\rm T}>26\GeV\), no electron candidates and at least one \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidate with 1 or 3 tracks and an absolute charge of one. As \(W\)+jets processes are expected to produce a substantial amount of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) due to the neutrino in the final state, the missing transverse energy must satisfy \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>20\GeV\). Additionally, the transverse mass between the muon and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\), \(m_{\rm T}=\sqrt{2E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}p_{\rm T}^{\mu}(1-\cos(\Delta\phi)}\) where \(\Delta\phi\) is the azimuthal angle between the muon and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\), is required to be greater than 50. A total of 1629 events are selected. The leading-\(p_{\rm T}\)\(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidate in each event is selected for further analysis. A summary of the contributions are given in Tab. 2. The contribution from multijets is negligible.

The kinematics and track multiplicity of the \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidate are shown in Figs. 8 and Fig. 9, respectively. The input variables to the tau identification and the tau identification score for the \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidate are

The statistical uncertainty from the simulation is depicted by the hashed area and the red band in the inset.

The \(m_{\rm track}\) and \(\Delta R_{\rm max}\) variables are shown only for \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) with three core tracks as they are not used in the identification for candidates with one core track.

### \(Z(\rightarrow\mu\mu)\)+jets

Here we select \(Z(\rightarrow\mu\mu)\)+jets events where the \(Z\) boson decays into two muons and where the reconstructed muon-pair mass is close to the \(Z\) mass. As these events have very low background contribution at the level of \(<1\%\)[29], the data are compared directly to simulated \(Z(\rightarrow\mu\mu)\)+jets events. The modeling of the tau identification and the properties of neutral cluster in the core cone of the tau candidate are evaluated.

Events are selected by a trigger that requires two muons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>15\), respectively. The events must contain exactly two muons, selected as described in Sec. 2, but with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>26\) and that have opposite charge. To suppress any remaining background, the reconstructed mass of the di-muon system has to lie within 81 and 101. With this event selection, the reconstructed \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidates in the event originate almost uniquely from jets. These \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidates are required to pass the tau selection as described in Sec. 2 and only the leading-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) candidate in each event is considered for further analysis. A total of 264 \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidates are selected.

Figure 12 shows that the kinematics of reconstructed \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidates are well modelled within the statistical uncertainty after normalising the contribution from simulation to the number of events in the data. Figure 13 shows the tau identification score. Figure 14 shows variables that quantify the shape of neutral cluster in the core cone of the \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) candidate. All distributions are well modelled within the statistical uncertainty.

### \(Z(\to ee)\)+jets

In addition to background formed by hadronic jets, electrons can imitate the signature of \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidates with one associated track. For Run 2, the discrimination between electrons and \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) is based on the likelihood of geometrically overlapping electrons. This likelihood is calculated from shower shape and tracking information. In the following, basic properties of electrons reconstructed as \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidates are investigated. Events with an electron and a \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidate (tag- and probe-lepton, respectively) are selected. The estimation of contributions from Standard Model processes other than \(Z(\to ee)\)+jets follows the method used for measurements of the electron-to-\(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) misidentification probability described in Ref. [25]. This includes the estimation of the multijet contribution using events in the data where the electron and \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidate have the same electric charge. In contrast, normalisation of the simulated contributions by comparisons with the data in control regions is not performed. The expected same-sign contribution is subtracted from each simulated sample as it is accounted for by the same-sign events in the data.

The events are triggered by either a low-\(p_{\rm T}\) (\(>24\) GeV) or a high-\(p_{\rm T}\) (\(>60\) GeV) single electron fulfilling different quality criteria. At least one electron (the tag-lepton) fulfilling the selection described in Sec. 2 and also tight quality and tight isolation criteria is required. The transverse momentum of the electron must exceed \(30\) GeV. The leading-\(p_{\rm T}\) electron is chosen for further analysis.

The probe \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidate must pass the selection criteria detailed in Sec. 2. Only probe candidates with exactly one associated track are considered for this study. The leading-\(p_{\rm T}\)\(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidate is chosen for further analysis. The electron and probe \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidate must have opposite electric charge sign and their invariant mass, \(m_{\ell\ell}\), is required to be within \(80\) GeV \(<m_{\ell\ell}<100\) GeV. A total of 266 events are selected with these criteria with a high purity of \(Z(\to ee)\)+jets events. The contributions are summarised in Tab. 3.

In Fig. 15 basic kinematic properties of the probe \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidate are shown. For all distributions a reasonable agreement between the data and simulation is observed, indicating a working modelling of tau reconstruction in \(Z(\to ee)\)+jets events.

### \(Z\to\tau\tau\)

A sample of hadronic tau decays from \(Z(\to\tau\tau)\) +jets events, in the channel where one tau decays to a muon and neutrinos and the other tau decays hadronically, is used to commission the online and offline reconstruction and identification of \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidates. Events are collected using a trigger that requires a muon with \(p_{\rm T}>14\GeV\) in the high-\(\mu\) runs described in Sec. 1. The events in the data are required to pass the data quality criteria listed in Sec. 2. The data are compared to the high-\(\mu\) Monte Carlo samples listed in Sec. 2. The estimation of contributions from Standard Model processes other than \(Z\to\tau\tau\) follows the method used for tau trigger efficiency measurements described in Ref. [25]. This includes the correction of the \(W(\to\mu\nu)\)+jets contribution in a control region and the estimation of multijet events using events where the muon and \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidate have the same electric charge. The expected same-sign contribution is subtracted from each simulated sample as it is accounted for by the same-sign events in the data. The physics objects used in this analysis are required to pass the reconstruction and identification criteria described in Sec. 2. As a preselection, events that contain exactly one muon candidate, one \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidate and no electron candidates are selected. In addition, the offline reconstructed muon candidate must have \(p_{\rm T}>22\GeV\) and must be matched to the muon trigger object that triggered the event. The \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidate must have \(p_{\rm T}>25\GeV\) and pass the medium tau identification and an overlap removal with loosely identified electrons. To reduce the backgrounds from the \(W\to\mu\nu\) and \(Z\to\mu\mu\) processes, further selection criteria are applied. The transverse mass between the muon candidate and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) is required to be less than \(40\GeV\). The difference in the pseudorapidity of the muon candidate and the \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidate is required to satisfy \(|\Delta\eta|<2.0\). The difference between the \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidate and muon candidate momenta must lie in the range \(\Delta p_{\rm T}=p_{\rm T}^{\tau}-p_{\rm T}^{\mu}>-20\GeV\). Finally, \(\sum\cos\Delta\phi=\cos\Delta\phi(\mu,E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss})+\cos\Delta\phi( \tau,E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss})\) is required to be greater than \(-0.4\) and the visible mass must be in the range \(40\GeV<m_{\rm vis}(\mu,\tau_{\rm had})<80\GeV\). A summary of the event yields after the full selection is given in Tab. 4. Comparisons between the data and the estimated contributions of Standard Model processes are shown in Figs. 16-18. Despite the limited statistical power, a high purity of \(Z\to\tau\tau\) events is obtained and the comparisons give the first indication of good modelling of the \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) reconstruction using selected hadronic tau decays.

Finally, the \(Z\to\tau\tau\) events can be used to test the online \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) reconstruction and identification. To do this, the offline \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidate in the event is matched to an online \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidate with \(p_{\rm T}>35\GeV\) that passes the online medium identification and is required to have between one and three tracks.

## 4 Conclusion

The 13 TeV proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS detector in the early phase of Run 2 of the LHC were used to commission the tau reconstruction. Comparisons between the data and simulation were made in minimum bias, \(W(\to\mu\nu)+\)jets, dijets, \(Z(\to\mu\mu)+\)jets, \(Z(\to ee)+\)jets and \(Z\to\tau\tau\) events. In all these studies, reasonably good agreement between the data and simulation was observed. The level of agreement indicates a good description of the detector response to reconstructed \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidates. Studies of \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) candidates such as those presented in this note will be performed with larger datasets in the future. These studies will allow the derivation of corrections to improve the modelling of the \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\) reconstruction and identification in the simulation.
