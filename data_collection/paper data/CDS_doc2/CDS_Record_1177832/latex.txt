**A method for discovering heavy particles decaying into single boosted jets with substructure using the \(k_{\perp}\) algorithm**

The ATLAS Collaboration

This note demonstrates a recently proposed method for determining the mass of boosted particles from their decay into jets by exploiting the substructure of the resulting single collimated jet using the \(k_{\perp}\) algorithm. We illustrate this method with a simple R-Parity violating supersymmetric model using the ATLAS detector at the LHC. We consider the hadronic decay of boosted neutralinos into single jets composed of three collimated subjets. We consider up to 1fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity with 10 TeV simulated data.

Introduction

We test a method, recently proposed by J.M. Butterworth et al [1], for discovering heavy particles by looking at their boosted decays into single collimated jets. In a study performed without detector simulation they use this method to reconstruct the decay of the neutralino. In the model of supersymmetry (SUSY) they consider the neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The substructure of the collimated jets, which they look at using the \(k_{\perp}\) algorithm [2, 3], is proposed as a way of separating the signal from the background. We take their approach, which was performed without detector simulation, and test its suitability for use at ATLAS. Similar techniques have also been used in [4, 5] to analyse \(WW\) scattering. In common with [1] we choose to illustrate the method by investigating neutralino decay products in an R-parity violating (RPV) supersymmetric model with baryon number violation. This is a convenient straw model to simulate, but it is hoped that the performance of the method would be equally well tested or demonstrated in any other (by no means necessarily supersymmetric) model with similar kinematics - namely a massive particle with a boost decaying to three semi-collimated light jets.

We take the explicit R-Parity violating terms of the supersymmetric Lagrangian to be the following allowed in soft SUSY breaking:

\[W=\frac{1}{2}\lambda^{ijk}L_{i}L_{j}\bar{e}_{k}+\lambda^{{}^{\prime}ijk}L_{i }Q_{j}\bar{d}_{k}+\mu^{{}^{\prime}i}L_{i}H_{u}+\frac{1}{2}\lambda^{{}^{\prime }ijk}\bar{u}_{i}\bar{d}_{j}\bar{d}_{k} \tag{1}\]

where all terms in the Lagrangian are defined in [6].

Models with non-zero \(\lambda^{{}^{\prime}}\) are baryon number violating and introduce the decay \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\to qqq\). In a busy hadronic environment these decays will be difficult to extract from combinatoric background. Some chains produce a high \(p_{T}\) lepton in conjunction with the three jets. This has already been studied as a means of identifying this decay [7, 8]. By using this new method we avoid the need to use a lepton requirement.

## 2 Method

This section summarises the \(k_{\perp}\) algorithm, the primary tool used in this method to reconstruct jets and classify jet substructure. The algorithm runs over the collection of calorimeter clusters. For object \(k\) and pair of objects \((k,l)\) it calculates the resolution variables given by Equations 2 and 3.

\[d_{kB}=p_{Tk}^{2} \tag{2}\]

\[d_{kl}=min(p_{Tk}^{2},p_{Tl}^{2})R_{kl}^{2}/R^{2} \tag{3}\]

Here \(p_{Tk}\) is the transverse momentum of object \(k\) with respect to the beam axis and \(R_{kl}^{2}\) the separation in \(\eta-\phi\) space defined by Equation 41. The precise definition of these three quantities \(d_{kB}\), \(d_{kl}\) and \(R_{kl}^{2}\) control how the \(k_{\perp}\) algorithm behaves in the soft and collinear limits. We use the \(\Delta R\) angular scheme [9]. The choice of scheme is not expected to affect the highly boosted jets in which we are interested. The algorithm finds the smallest of \(d_{kB}\) and \(d_{kl}\). If \(d_{kl}\) is the smallest then \(k\) and \(l\) are combined into a single object with momentum \(p_{kl}\) (Equation 5). If \(d_{kB}\) is smallest the object is merged with the beam pipe object. This process is repeated until all objects have been included as jets. The parameter \(R\) in Equation 3 is normally of order one. Higher \(R\) parameters worsen the jet mis-reconstruction but improve the signal efficiency. We use an \(R\) parameter of 0.7 to keep signal efficiency high (though the choice of \(R\) parameter has not been optimised). The way that the \(p_{kl}\) of the new combined objects is calculated depends on the specified recombination scheme. Here we use the 'E scheme' where the four momenta of the two objects are simply combined according to Equation 5.

\[R_{kl}^{2}=(\eta_{k}-\eta_{l})^{2}+(\phi_{k}-\phi_{l})^{2} \tag{4}\]

\[p_{kl}=p_{k}+p_{l} \tag{5}\]

The scale at which jets from two or more very collimated partons separate into their subjets is reflected by the values of \(d_{kl}\) calculated in the jet-finding algorithm. The proposed variable \(y\), defined as \(y=\ d_{kl}/m^{2}\) where \(m\) is the jet mass, is used to isolate the signal from the background [1]. Reconstructed jet mass is defined as \(\sqrt{E^{2}-p^{2}}\) of the final objects. The sequence of \(y\) values effectively records the distance between the merged jet constituents. This definition of the variable \(y\) differs from the commonly used variable, where the \(d_{kl}\) are divided by square of the jet \(p_{T}\). Reasons for using this definition of \(y\) are given in [1]. We define \(y_{1}\) as the \(d_{kl}\) value from the last merging and \(y_{2}\) as the \(d_{kl}\) value from the next-to-last merging.

This technique relies on the decaying particle, in this case the \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\), having sufficient boost to decay into three relatively collimated jets. Figure 1 illustrates a measure of the pseudo cone-radius as a function of neutralino \(p_{T}\) for the three signal neutralino decay products (at parton level). The radius plotted is the smaller of the circumradius formed by the three jets (the relevant triangle used in the calculation of the circumradius having sides of length \(R_{ij}\) as defined in Equation 4) and half the largest of the \(R_{ij}\). We see from this figure that as the neutralinos become more boosted the degree of jet collimation increases.

Event Generation and Simulation

### Model

To illustrate this method we use the mSUGRA bulk benchmark point SPS1a [10]. This model gives fairly light sparticle masses and in particular a neutralino LSP with a mass \(m_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}}=96.1\) GeV. Setting \(\lambda_{112}^{{}^{\prime\prime}}=0.001\) as the only non-zero coupling in Equation 1 adds R-parity violation to this model. This model was chosen in [1] due to its reasonably high cross-section (17.4 pb at LO) but difficult dominant final state. By this we mean that the choice of \(\lambda^{{}^{\prime\prime}}\) ensures a final decay with no heavy flavours or displaced vertices to aid identification of the signal. SPS1a, or the 'Snowmass' point, has \(m_{0}=100\)GeV, \(\tan\beta=10\), \(A_{0}=-100\), \(m_{\frac{1}{2}}=250\)GeV and \(sign(\mu)>0\). Selected sparticle masses are given in Table 1 for this model.

We note that this particular coupling, \(\lambda_{112}^{{}^{\prime\prime}}=0.001\), is actually ruled out by current experimental bounds [11, 12] but we are simply testing a method.

### Event Generation

For our studies SPS1a+RPV signal events were generated using the Pythia[13] Monte Carlo generator (using the old Pythia showering scheme) for 10 TeV proton-proton collisions. We consider dijets, \(W+\)jets, \(Z+\)jets and \(t\bar{t}\) as backgrounds. Dijets were generated using Pythia (with the standard showering scheme), the \(W+\)jets and \(Z+\)jets samples using Alpgen[14] and \(t\bar{t}\) generated using MC@NLO[15].

### Detector Simulation

Events were passed through the complete ATLAS detector simulation and reconstruction. Locally-calibrated topoclusters (topological clusters [16]) were built from calorimeter cells and passed as input to the \(k_{\perp}\) algorithm using an \(R\) parameter of 0.7.

Reconstruction algorithms initially do not know the final state of an event and therefore reconstruct anything that resembles the signature of the final state object to be reconstructed. For this reason to complete the event reconstruction, particle identification cuts must be applied to objects outputted by the reconstruction algorithms. The various reconstruction algorithms (for example electrons, muons, and jets) also do not know what the other algorithms are doing. During this final state selection, one must also remove reconstructed objects which overlap with other objects because the separate reconstruction algorithms have used the same or similar inputs (ie tracks and calorimeter clusters) to reconstruct different particles.

* Electron objects must be reconstructed with \(p_{T}>0\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\). These objects must also pass the'medium' electron cuts defined in [17].
* Muon objects must be reconstructed with \(p_{T}>10\) GeV. These objects have a cut on the matched tracking fit between the inner detector and the outer muon systems of \(\chi^{2}<100\). The energy deposited within a cone \(\Delta R=0.2\) around the muon is required to be \(<10\) GeV.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c} \hline \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) & \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) & \(\tilde{g}\) & \(\tilde{u}_{R}\) & \(\tilde{u}_{L}\) & \(\tilde{d}_{R}\) & \(\tilde{d}_{L}\) & \(\tilde{l}_{R}\) & \(\tilde{l}_{L}\) & \(h^{0}\) \\ \hline \hline
96.1 & 176.8 & 595.2 & 520.4 & 537.2 & 520.1 & 543.0 & 143.0 & 202.1 & 114.0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Masses of selected particles (GeV) for the signal model * Photon objects must be reconstructed with \(p_{T}>10\) GeV and \(|\eta|<3.5\). These objects must also pass similar calorimeter cuts to the electron candidates.
* Tau objects must be reconstructed with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<3.5\). Tau objects must also have a likelihood descriminant greater than \(-6\)[18].
* Jet objects must be reconstructed with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<5.0\).

Reconstructed objects passing the above cuts are now said to overlap if they are within \(\Delta R=0.2\) of each other, or if one is a jet \(\Delta R=0.3\). The decision which object to keep is based upon an order of particle types. Electrons are preferred before photons, photons are preferred before muons, muons are preferred before taus, and taus are preferred before jets.

## 4 Event Selection

### Offline Cuts

We consider \(y_{1}\) and \(y_{2}\) - the y-values resulting from the last and next-to-last merging of the jets and make the following offline cuts:

1. at least four jets in the event, with the four highest \(p_{T}\) jets having \(|\eta|<2.5\)
2. two jets with \(p_{T}>275\) GeV
3. for both of these jets \(y_{2}>-0.17y_{1}+0.08\)
4. two further jets both with \(p_{T}>135\) GeV

The cut flow is given in Table 2.

The first high \(p_{T}\) jet cut (275 GeV) is used to select the highly boosted candidates (here we ask for two because we are looking for SUSY events where each of the two decay chains should end in an LSP). The \(y_{1,2}\) cut then eliminates a significant proportion of the background by exploiting the substructure of the boosted jets which are formed by the merging of the three subjets. The rejection achieved using these hard \(p_{T}\) cuts and structure cuts is not sufficient to obtain a significant signal. In order to achieve higher background rejection we make an additional cut, which requires two jets with \(p_{T}>135\) GeV, to exploit the properties of the rest of the SUSY decay chain. Approximately 40% of neutralinos are produced directly by the decay of a squark. The decay of a squark to a neutralino will also lead to an additional quark jet. Therefore we expect two non-neutralino jets in many of our RPV SUSY events (and also in events with longer decay chains where it is still likely a jet will have been produced somewhere in the cascade). These extra cuts therefore maintain high signal efficiency but further increase dijet

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c} \hline  & Cut 1 & Cuts 1 \& 2 & Cuts 1,2 \& 3 & Cuts 1,2,3 \& 4 \\ \hline \hline SUSY & 14577 & 5849 & 792 & 347 \\ \(t\bar{t}\) & \(2.3\times 10^{5}\) & \(2,000\) & 200 & 1 \\ dijets & \(3.2\times 10^{9}\) & \(1.1\times 10^{6}\) & \(1.8\times 10^{4}\) & 1100 \\ \(W\!+\!\)jets & 1500 & 20 & 20 & 0 \\ \(Z\!+\!\)jets & \(1.9\times 10^{4}\) & 210 & 2 & 1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Offline Cut Flow (all counts are Events per 1 fb\({}^{-1}\))background rejection. These extra jets are, however, SUSY specific cuts and therefore for other models these jet substructure cuts may need to be combined with different additional model specific cuts in order to obtain sufficient rejection.

In our final jet-mass distributions, we plot the jets with transverse momenta greater than 275 GeV and \(y_{1,2}\) values satisfying \(y_{2}>-0.17y_{1}+0.08\) in events passing all selection cuts. That is, for each event which we suspect has two reconstructed neutralino candidates in we consider the masses of all possible neutralino candidates.

### Trigger

To decrease the initial bunch-crossing rate of 40 MHz to the 100-200Hz selected for permanent storage, the ATLAS detector has a three-level trigger and data-acquisition system. It is important to have triggers which pass signal events efficiently. In what follows we use the convention that nJxx is a trigger which requires n jets with \(p_{T}>\)xx GeV and JExx a trigger asking for a jet with energy greater than xx GeV. Signal events are expected to have multiple high-\(p_{T}\) jets; consequently, we investigate single (Jxx), multijet (3Jxx, 4Jxx) and total jet energy (JExx) triggers as appropriate candidates.

From the trigger efficiencies in Table 3 we conclude that the ATLAS trigger system has several unprescaled jet triggers that pass signal events with very high efficiency, guaranteeing that these are not lost from the events recorded. In this table we give the efficiency before event selection (which is the efficiency for all generated events passing the triggers) and the efficiency after event selection (which is the efficiency for offline selected events passing the triggers). The efficiency after selection is most relevant and should be near to 100% for the best triggers. Though an explicit trigger selection was not used for the results shown in subsequent sections, they will not be degraded due to losses of events at the trigger level. The most suitable triggers to use are the multijet triggers, however were their rates to be unexpectedly high and require prescaling, the unprescaled single jet trigger could also be used, with only a slight decrease in the significance of results. This would also be most suitable for a boosted particle decay in lower jet multiplicity events.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c} \hline Trigger Name & Total Prescale & Effic. before event selection (\%) & Effic. after event selection (\%) \\ \hline \hline J350 & 1 & 50.0 & 82.7 \\
3J180 & 1 & 56.0 & 98.3 \\
4J95 & 20 & 77.6 & 99.6 \\
3J60 & 1000 & 95.0 & 99.6 \\ J265 & 15 & 75.5 & 99.6 \\
4J125 & 1 & 55.8 & 99.6 \\ JE280 & 2 & 91.0 & 100 \\ JE340 & 1 & 83.2 & 100 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Results

Having reconstructed hadronic jets using the \(k_{\perp}\) algorithm as detailed in Section 2, we investigate the jet \(p_{T}\) and mass spectrum in detail (Figure 2). The signal distribution features as a vertical band at a mass of approximately \(100\,\mathrm{GeV}\) (around the peak of our heavy particle resonance), present in jets with transverse momenta above \(250\,\mathrm{GeV}\). In contrast, the standard model background has no such structure; the bulk of the distribution lies at low \(p_{T}\) and mass, with a smooth decrease toward higher values of \(p_{T}\) and mass. This validates our strategy of selecting those jets produced by heavy particle decays by employing a high \(p_{T}\) jet cut. This is illustrated further by projecting onto the jet mass axis as in Figure 3, where the peak from our heavy particle can be seen clearly in the signal events. Jets from the decay of highly-boosted W bosons and top quarks cause noticeable peaks near their respective masses. The dominant contribution to our background is from QCD jets which must be reduced by several orders of magnitude before these mass peaks can become experimentally detectable.

To achieve this reduction, we investigate the substructure of jets with \(p_{T}>275\) GeV as detailed by their \(y\) values. Figure 4 compares these distributions for various event topologies. Our \(y\) value cut is indicated with a dashed line. For the distributions of both \(y_{1}\) and \(y_{2}\) in signal events we see wider distributions than we see for background. These are features which could be exploited to reduce the background rate from QCD processes dramatically, albeit with some loss of signal. Applying a \(y\) value cut of

0.08 along with requiring two other jets with \(p_{T}>135\) GeV, to increase the background rejection further, completes our event selection (Section 4). The resultant jet mass distribution is illustrated by Figure 5. This event selection impacts our signal efficiency, however its impact is greater away from the signal jet mass peak, which is decreased by a factor of 10. This reduction compares favourably with the large suppression of QCD jets at a level of \(10^{3}\) across the jet mass range. This continuum distribution is characterised by a turn-on from a low threshold followed by a smooth decay to higher masses, extending beyond 200 GeV. In Figure 6 we also plot the \(p_{T}\) distribution of jets in the signal sample passing our event selection cuts. This distribution illustrates the transverse momentum range of the jets we have selected as our heavy particle candidates.

If we directly compare the resulting dijet background and signal mass distribution (Figure 7) we see that we have comparable numbers of signal and background events. Moreover, there remains a very clear peak in the signal distribution at the mass of the neutralino, and the signal peak has not been distorted in any unpleasant way by the substructure cuts (cut 3 defined in Section 4. The QCD mass distribution suffers from low statistics, due to the limited Monte Carlo datasets available, leading to high event weights. In order to reduce these event weights we would need at least an order of magnitude more events. In real data this will not be a problem and so the errors we can expect from \(1\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) are better modelled by the Poisson errors, which we show in Figure 7 as the smaller of the two sets of vertical error bars. The key to the success or failure of this analysis, since we are looking for a peak on a smooth controlled background, simply depends however, on the amount of background underneath the signal and on the degree to which we can measure or estimate its size and shape. We expect that by loosening our cuts slightly, and by making use of the very large cross section for QCD production at the LHC, it should be relatively easy to create samples very much enriched in the backgrounds. Examination of the jet-mass distributions of such background enriched samples (from real data) would provide the primary means of ascertaining the true shape and smoothness (or otherwise) of the underlying background distributions. We see that for this straw model, the background has been reduced to a level at which it is of manageable size in comparison to the signal. This suggests that models (whether supersymmetric or otherwise) which can pair produce states with mass greater than \(\sim 100\)GeV, with transverse momenta similar to those of Figure 6, and where those states subsequently decay to three jets, may be observable at ATLAS.

The shape and post-selection cross-section of the QCD background are the main systematic uncertainties in this analysis. For example, if the QCD background were twice as large, any signal significance

Figure 6: Jet \(p_{T}\) for jets with \(p_{T}>275\) GeV and \(y_{2}>-0.17y_{1}+0.08\) in signal events passing all event selection cuts

would drop by a factor of \(\sqrt{2}\). The shape of the mass distribution may also change. The steeper the slope of the QCD background distribution towards high mass, the greater the signal cross-section needed to obtain high signal significance. If we have a flatter background distribution we will be able to find evidence for a signal peak at much lower signal cross-sections or with more QCD background. The cuts we have chosen have not been fully optimised, rather they serve to illustrate the suitability of the method.

## 6 Conclusions

We have demonstrated that the recently proposed method for reconstructing heavy particles from their decays into jets which collimate into a single jet [1] might be suitable for use at ATLAS. We are able to cut on the \(y_{1}\) and \(y_{2}\) values of high \(p_{T}\) jets in order to significantly reduce the number of dijet background events present. We have illustrated this point by searching for R-Parity Violating \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\to qqq\) SUSY decays and exploiting jet substructure to select jets of boosted neutralino decays preferentially, significantly reducing the hadronic background.

We note that, although an R-parity violating supersymmetric point was simulated and studied, we have nonetheless managed to avoid making the analysis depend strongly on this choice. In particular, the only substantive ways in which the analysis has been 'aided' by the choice of a supersymmetric model are that (1) supersymmetric pair-production provides a natural source of _pairs_ of neutralinos to reconstruct, and (2) long decay chains provide a simple source both of boosts for the decaying particles and additional jets (numbers three and four) to cut on to reduce QCD backgrounds. The range of applicability of this test of the method of [1] is, at this stage, only therefore confirmed for models with _pair_ production of the relevant decaying state in which the mass and transverse momentum spectrum of the decaying particle are similar to those seen here, and in which there is an equivalent means of providing the part of the background rejection provided by the cuts on the third and fourth jets.
