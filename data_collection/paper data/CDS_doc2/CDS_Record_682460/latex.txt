**Abstract**

This paper documents the ATLFAST algorithm for particle-level analysis. The algorithm is implemented as an independent package written in FORTRAN77. It can be used in the case of \(pp\) or \(p\overline{p}\) collisions for fast event-analysis in cluding the most crucial detector aspects: jet reconstruction in the calorimeters, momentum/energy smearing for leptons and photons, magnetic field effects and missing transverse energy. It provides, starting from the list of particles in the event, the list of reconstructed jets, isolated leptons and photons and the expected missing transverse energy. The detector-dependent parameters are tuned to what is expected for the performance of the ATLAS detector, but the package is universal and can be used for any other detector after straightforward modifications.

Particle-level analysis is a kind of intermediate step between simple parton-level analysis of the event topology and very sophisticated and CPU-consuming full detector simulation. It can be done in a more or less complex way but is _never_ meant to replace the full simulation of the detector response. However this kind of analysis is necessary if quick and approximate estimates of signal and background rates for given channel are needed. In many cases simple parton-level analysis gives too optimistic results, which are even sometimes misleading.

A preliminary version of this package was already used for the studies described in [1], [2] and [3]. The difference between parton-level and particle-level (called there jet-level) analysis is discussed already in some detail in [1].

The present version of this package attempts to reproduce as well as possible the ATLAS detector mass resolution for important signal signatures, as expected from full simulation. It attempts to reproduce reasonably well the expected efficiency for lepton and photon isolation, but more particularly the efficiency for jet reconstruction, especially for b-jets and the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) resolution. However, for any given channel, these would have to be confirmed with full simulation results.

Not all detector effects can be readily parametrized in fast simulation and only the basic information of the detector geometry is used by the package. This basic information is for example: the \(\eta\)-coverage for precision physics and for the calorimetry, the size of the barrel/endcap transition region for the electromagnetic calorimeter, and the granularity of the calorimeters. No effects correlated with the detailed shapes of particle showers in the calorimeters, with the charged track multiplicity in jets, etc. are taken into account. In particular, energy isolation of leptons is only simulated in a crude way, and the results should always be replaced by those from more detailed simulations.

The main goal of this package is to analyse fully generated events and select isolated leptons and photons, reconstruct jets, identify b-jets and c-jets and estimate the missing transverse energy. A more or less accurate parametrization of photon, electron and muon momentum energy resolution is included, as well as a parametrization of the hadronic calorimeter energy resolution and the effect of the ATLAS magnetic field on jet reconstruction.

The outline of this note is as follows. Section 2 describes the physics issues of the algorithm used for the event analysis, and also compares the results from the package to those from full simulation. Section 3 discusses in more detail the reconstruction of b-jets and conclusions are given in Section 4. Appendix A instructs the reader on how to use the program and Appendix B and C describe the structure of the program, the subroutines, commons blocks, and functions.

Particle-level analysis

Fully generated events, generated including QED/QCD initial and final state radiation, fragmentation, hadronisation and decays of unstable particles are analysed with the package. Only the stable, final state particles are treated by the ATLFAST algorithm, which selects and stores reconstructed isolated leptons and photons, hadronic jets and tagged b-jets or c-jets.

### Calorimetric clusters and B-field

The transverse energies of all undecayed particles, except neutrinos, muons and the SUSY LSP, from the COMMON /LUJETS/ are summed up in calorimeter cells of a given granularity in \(\eta\times\phi\) coordinates (default: \(0.1\times 0.1\) for \(|\eta|<3\) and \(0.2\times 0.2\) for \(|\eta|>3\)) over the full calorimeter coverage (default: \(|\eta|<5\)). The effect of the solenoidal 2T magnetic field on the \(\phi\)-position of charged particles with \(p_{T}\) above threshold (default: \(p_{T}>0.5\) GeV) is parametrized in FUNCTION FLDPHI. It is assumed that the contribution from charged particles with \(p_{T}\) below this threshold is neglected.

All calorimeter cells with transverse energy greater than a given threshold (default: \(E_{T}^{init}>1.5\) GeV) are taken as possible initiators of clusters in order of decreasing \(E_{T}\), to verify whether the total \(E_{T}\) summed over all cells in a cone \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\) (default: \(\Delta R=0.4\) ) exceeds the minimum required threshold for a reconstructed cluster (default: \(E_{T}^{clu}>10\) GeV). Cells with deposited transverse energy below threshold (default: \(0\) GeV) are not accounted for. Reconstructed clusters are stored in COMMON /CLUSTER/ and the cell energy depositions in COMMON /CELLS/. Cells used for cluster reconstruction are labelled. Its is also possible to invoke an algorithm for the energy sharing of cells belonging to overlaping jets.

No energy smearing is applied yet to these clusters, since some of them represent photon-clusters or electron-clusters. Appropriate energy smearing will be applied only after cluster identification.

### Isolated photons

Isolated photon candidates are searched for in the particle COMMON /LUJETS/. Each photon momentum is smeared according to a Gaussian energy resolution parametrized in FUNCTION RESPHO. The polar angle of the photon is smeared with a Gaussian resolution parametrized in FUNCTION RESTHE. Two options: for low and high luminosity can be invoked.

For each of these photons which passes the selection criteria in \(p_{T}\) and \(|\eta|\) (default: \(p_{T}>10\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\)), the reconstructed calorimeter cluster associated with it is identified (default: \(\Delta R_{\gamma,cluster}<0.1\)). Photon isolation cuts, in terms of distance from other clusters and of maximum transverse energy deposition in cells in a cone around the photon, are then applied (defaults: separation by \(\Delta R>0.4\)from other clusters and \(E_{T}^{dep}<10\) GeV in a cone \(\Delta R=0.2\) around the photon). All photons passing the isolation criteria are stored in COMMON /ISOPHO/ and the clusters associated with them are removed from COMMON /CLUSTER/. These chosen default isolation criteria have a 99% efficiency for photons from direct \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) production and decay. The same isolation criteria have also been studied in [4] for photon bremsstrahlung backgrounds. Their choice is somewhat arbitrary and their efficiency should always be estimated from full detector simulation.

The mass resolution for photon pairs from a generated sample of \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) events is shown in Table 1, for low and high-luminosity performance and is in good agreement with results from full simulation of the Accordion calorimeter [5].

### Isolated electrons

Isolated electron candidates are searched for in the particle COMMON /LUJETS/. Each electron momentum is smeared, according to a Gaussian energy resolution parametrized in FUNCTION RESELE. Two options, one for low luminosity (KEYLU=1) and one for high luminosity (KEYLUM=2) can be invoked.

For each of these electrons which passes the selection criteria in \(p_{T}\) and \(|\eta|\) (default: \(p_{T}>5\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) ), the reconstructed cluster associated with it is identified (default: \(\Delta R_{e,duter}<0.1\)). Electron isolation cuts, in terms of distance from other clusters and of maximum transverse energy deposition in cells in a cone around the electron are then applied (defaults: separation by \(\Delta R>0.4\) from other clusters and \(E_{T}^{dep}<10\) GeV in a cone \(\Delta R=0.2\) around the electron). All electrons passing the isolation criteria are stored in COMMON /ISOPLE/ and the clusters associated with them are removed from COMMON /CLUSTER/.

Muons outside the \(p_{T}\) or \(|\eta|\) acceptance are lost.

The mass resolution for muon pairs, obtained from a generated sample of \(\mathrm{Z}/\gamma^{*}\to\mu\mu\) events is shown in Table 3, with and without subtraction of the natural \(Z\) width, and for the three options for the muon momentum measurement. The mass resolution for four muons, obtained from generated sample of \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}^{(*)}\to 4\mu\) events is shown in Table 3 also. The full simulation of the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}^{(*)}\to 4\mu\) events was done for the ATLAS Technical Proposal (TP) configuration of the toroidal magnetic field of the Muon System and will be redone with the new reference configuration.

### Jet reconstruction

Clustered cells are used for the jet reconstruction. The energies of clusters, which have not been selected as associated with isolated electrons or photons, are smeared

\end{table}

For the \(\mathrm{Z}/\gamma^{*}\to\mu\mu\) events results are given with and without subtraction of the natural \(Z\) width. The results from full simulation of the ATLAS Inner Detector (“Morges” layout) are also given._according to a Gaussian energy resolution parametrized in FUNCTION RESHAD. The energy of non-isolated muons which fall inside the cluster cone is added to the smeared cluster energy. The resulting jet clusters with \(E_{T}\) greater than a given threshold (default: \(E_{T}>15\) GeV) are labelled as reconstructed jets, stored in COMMON /JETALL/ and removed from COMMON /CLUSTER/.

The mass resolution of such reconstructed jet pairs is shown in Fig. 1, for pairs of light-quark jets and gluon-jets for events generated through \(WH\) production, with \(H\to u\bar{u}\) and \(H\to gg\) decays and \(m_{\PH}=100\) GeV. The reconstructed mass peaks are shifted to values significantly lower than the chosen Higgs boson mass, and this shift is larger for gluon jets. The width of the reconstructed peak and the non-gaussian tails at low dijet-mass values are also substantially larger for gluon jets. Section 3 describes a procedure to correct the jet energies in order to get rid of the mass shifts observed in Fig. 1 and discusses in more detail the impact of the low mass tails in the dijet mass distributions observed in Fig. 1.

### Jets labelled as b-jets and c-jets

Of special interest are jets originating from b-quarks (so-called b-jets) which can be identified using b-tagging techniques (vertex or soft-lepton tags). The package labels a jet as a b-jet, if a b-quark of \(p_{T}>5\) GeV (after FSR) is found in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.2\) around the reconstructed jet for jets with \(|\eta|<2.5\). These criteria have been discussed in more detail in [1]. These b-jets are stored in COMMON /BJET/ and removed from COMMON /JETALL/. The mass resolution of reconstructed \(b\overline{b}\) pairs is of special interest and is shown in Fig. 2, for events generated through \(WH\) production with \(H\to b\overline{b}\) and for \(m_{\rm H}\)=100 GeV. The results are shown in three cases: a) no magnetic field and no smearing, b) magnetic field and no smearing and c) magnetic field and smearing. The dominant mass shift arises from final state radiation and hadronisation (-12.5 GeV), but a sizeable shift also originates from the magnetic field (-4.9 GeV). As shown by the Gaussian fits in Fig. 2, the impacts of the fragmentation, solenoidal magnetic field and energy smearing are similar and contribute each \(\sim 5\) GeV to the Gaussian part of the experimental resolution. The fraction of events within 82 \(\pm\) 20 GeV decreases from 86.5% (Fig. 2a), to 84% (Fig. 2b) and to 83% (Fig. 2c).

In a similar way a COMMON /CJET/ is filled with the jets associated to charm quarks.

### Missing transverse energy

The missing transverse energy \(E_{T}^{miss}\) is calculated by summing the transverse momenta of identified isolated photons, electrons and muons, of jets, b-jets and c-jets, of clusters not accepted as jets and of non-isolated muons not added to any jet cluster. Finally, the transverse energies deposited in cells not used for cluster reconstruction are also included in the total sum. Transverse energies deposited in unused cells are smeared with the same energy resolution function as for jets, and cells with a deposited transverse energy below a given threshold (default: \(E_{T}^{thr}<0\) GeV) are excluded from the sum. From the calculation of this total sum \(E_{T}^{obs}=\sqrt{(p_{x}^{obs})^{2}+(p_{y}^{obs})^{2}}\), the missing transverse energy is obtained, \(E_{T}^{miss}=E_{T}^{obs}\), as well as the missing transverse momentum components, \(p_{x}^{miss}=-p_{x}^{obs}\), \(p_{y}^{miss}=-p_{y}^{obs}\). The total calorimeter transverse energy, \(\sum E_{T}^{CALO}\) is calculated as the sum of all the above transverse energies except that of muons.

Fig. 3 shows the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) distribution calculated using the above procedure, compared to the transverse energy distribution of particles escaping detection (muons outside the detector acceptance and neutrinos) for generated \(WH\) events with \(W\rightarrow\ell\nu\) and \(H\to b\overline{b}\). The \(E_{T}^{miss}\) resolution, \(\sigma^{miss}=\sigma(p_{x}^{miss})=\sigma(p_{y}^{miss})\), is given in Table 4 as a function of \(\sum E_{T}^{CALO}\), for three options: with and without magnetic field and energy smearing, and for the case of low luminosity. The results are consistent with what is expected from full simulation of the ATLAS detector [9].

### Trigger selection

A primitive trigger routine to validate selected physics events can be invoked after each event has been analysed by the algorithm. This routine is not meant to cover all ATLAS trigger aspects and levels, but rather to eliminate events which have essentially no chance of passing the ATLAS level-1 and level-2 trigger. It is more specifically dedicated to SUSY-particle searches, which will include many complex topologies of the type n-jets + m-leptons + \(E_{T}^{miss}\). The results from the ATLAS analysis, i.e. the lists of isolated electrons, photons, isolated and non-isolated muons, and reconstructed jets are used for this trigger selection.

The proposed trigger selection is aimed at:

* compatibility with present LVL1 + LVL2 understanding;
* complete coverage of possible signatures;
* slightly lower thresholds than in the TP for some cases where it might turn out to be justified from the physics and where it is not clearly impossible to implement.

Three classes of trigger particles are used for low and high luminosity performance:

* isolated electrons and photons,
* muons,
* jets.

The details of the default trigger criteria are given in Appendix B.15.

## 3 More about b-jet reconstruction

### Comparison to parton-level simulation

Parton-level simulation, where selection criteria are applied to quarks and gluons, often leads to too optimistic results. In [1], this parton-level simulation was compared to particle-level simulation (called there jet-level simulation), and large differences were observed for the reconstruction of b-jets and of invariant \(b\overline{b}\) masses and their source was identified. The main points of this discussion are recalled below:

* **Efficiency for b-jet reconstruction**\(\epsilon_{b-jet}^{recon}\).

The probability, that a b-quark produced in the hard scattering process, of \(p_{T}^{b-quark}>p_{T}^{threshold}\) leads to a reconstructed jet with \(p_{T}^{b-jet}>p_{T}^{threshold}\), labelled as a b-jet was studied carefully. This probability is close to 100%, if only hard-scattering process (HP) is generated and remains unchanged, if initial-state radiation (ISR) is included. However, if final-state radiation (FSR) and hadronisation (HD) are included also, this probability, called subsequently the efficiency for b-jet reconstruction \(\epsilon_{b-jet}^{recon}\), drops3 to \(\sim 80\%\) for \(p_{T}^{threshold}=15\) GeV and \(\Delta R_{cone}=0.4\) and for the

### Corrected jet energies

The possibility to recalibrate the peak position for the dijet mass has been studied for samples of u-jets, gluon-jets and b-jets obtained from \(WH\) production with respectively \(\rm H\to u\overline{u}\), \(\rm H\to gg\) and \(\rm H\to b\overline{b}\)  decays. The jet momenta are recalibrated by a correction factor \(K_{jet}=p_{T}^{parton}/p_{T}^{jet}\). Here, \(p_{T}^{parton}\) denotes the transverse momentum of the parton which initiated the jet (before FSR). Fig. 5 shows these correction factors as a function of \(p_{T}^{jet}\) for the three jet flavour initiators. For \(p_{T}^{jet}>50\) GeV, the distributions become asymptotically flat at a value \(K_{jet}\sim 1.1\) independent of the jet flavour. For \(p_{T}^{jet}<50\) GeV, \(K_{jet}\) is closer to unity for u-jets than for g-jets and b-jets. The values of \(K_{b-jet}\) and \(K_{g-jet}\) are the same within errors over the whole range of \(p_{T}^{jet}\). In fact, it is well known by now that the properties of b-jets and gluon jets are very similar, whereas they differ noticeably from these of light-quark jets [10].

The case of b-jets was studied further for b-jets containing at least one identifiable lepton (electron or muon with \(p_{T}>1\) GeV inside the jet cone), for which the correction factor \(K_{b-jet}^{lept}\) was calculated separately. Fig. 6 compares the two correction factors: \(K_{b-jet}^{average}\) and \(K_{b-jet}^{lept}\). It was observed that \(K_{b-jet}^{lept}\) is systematically higher. This can be qualitatively explained by the effect of missing neutrino(s) in b-jets with soft leptons. No strong dependence on the \(p_{T}\) of the soft lepton was found for \(K_{b-jet}^{lept}\), however this dependence is visible as a function of the transverse momenta of neutrinos in the final state.

Fig.7 shows the reconstructed \(m_{\mbox{b$\overline{\mbox{b}}$}}\) distribution (without correction) for all b-jets, for pairs with two non-leptonic b-jets (52% of the sample) and for pairs with two leptonic b-jets (8% of the sample). It can be seen that the pairs of non-leptonic b-jets give a distribution for \(m_{\mbox{b$\overline{\mbox{b}}$}}\) similar to that for pairs of u-jets (see Fig.1) while the pairs of leptonic b-jets give a much larger shift in the peak position and width than the average b-jets.

Figure 6: _Correction factor, \(K_{b-jet}=\frac{p_{\tau}^{b-quark}}{p_{\tau}^{b-jet}}\), as a function of \(p_{T}^{b-jet}\), shown separately for b-jets containing at least one identifiable soft lepton (solid line) and for all b-jets (dashed line)._

Fig. 8 compares the \(m_{\mbox{b$\overline{b}$}}\) distributions for \(WH\) events with \(H\to b\overline{b}\), where the b-jet momenta have been corrected by a factor \(K_{b-jet}\) and where the b-jet momenta have been corrected by separate factors \(K_{b-jet}^{non-lept}\) and \(K_{b-jet}^{lept}\). The width of the reconstructed mass peak, the acceptance in the mass window and the peak position are comparable in both cases as illustrated by Table 7.

Fig. 9 shows the \(m_{jj}\) distributions for \(WH\) events with \(H\to gg\) and \(H\to u\overline{u}\). The impact of correcting these jets by using the b-jet correction factor \(K_{b-jet}\) (left side of Fig. 9) or by using the correction factors, \(K_{g-jet}\) and \(K_{u-jet}\), determined specifically for each appropriate jet flavour (right side of Fig. 9), is noticeably only for \(H\to u\overline{u}\) decays. The position of the reconstructed mass peak and the acceptance in the mass window after corrections using correction factors \(K_{g-jet}\) and \(K_{u-jet}\) or using correction factor \(K_{b-jet}\) is shown in Table 8.

This first version of a somewhat elaborate particle-level simulation program, which incorporates most of the ATLAS detector performance parameters, can be used for many studies, where the details of the ATLAS detector performance (non-Gaussian tails, cracks, etc...) are not of crucial importance. For example, it is clear that systematic studies on SUSY particle searches [11], which are about to start in the framework of minimal supergravity models, can be carried out using ATLFAST.

On the other hand, the ATLFAST package can by no means replace the more detailed work involving full simulation of the ATLAS detector in fields such as:

\(\bullet\) mass resolution of multi-lepton and photon final states (e.g. \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) and \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}^{(*)}\to 4\ell\));

\(\bullet\) photon isolation (e.g. backgrounds to inclusive \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) and associated \(tt\,H,WH\) with \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channels);

\(\bullet\) lepton isolation (e.g. \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) and \(\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) backgrounds to \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}^{(*)}\to 4\ell\));

\(\bullet\) jet energy scale and dijet mass resolution in jet spectroscopy studies, e.g. \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) and \(W\to jj\) decays;

\(\bullet\) jet reconstruction efficiency (magnetic field, \(\eta\)-dependence, etc..);

\(\bullet\) b-tagging performance.

In the latter case, it is planned to repeat the study reported in [1] for \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) searches, incorporating into ATLFAST, the results on the ATLAS b-tagging performance, obtained from full simulation of all jet flavours at low and high luminosity. These results can be obtained from a full simulation of the Inner Detector done for vertex tags, but need full simulation of the whole ATLAS detector for soft lepton tags.

Similar upgrades to the ATLFAST package can be foreseen to refine its performance in many other cases.

The next steps include the possibility to superimpose minimum bias to the signal events, in order to study the effect of the pile-up on the various physics channels investigated. They imply also the implementation of ATLFAST into the ATGEN package in order to have a complete tool for physics studies at particle level.
