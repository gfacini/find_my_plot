## Magnetic system description

To make the map of the ATLAS barrel (new version) and end-cap toroids (BARREL and END-CAP) magnetic field the set of 3-dimensional calculations is done using the analytic calculations: the one turn of pancake is taken as the line element of the current. This description of the current element more meets design criteria, than it was in the previous note [1] and important for track calculation of particles at the close range the current element and for loads calculation of the magnetic forces on the pancake.

In the present work the current element is rectangular and we consider the magnetic field away from the curved element of current (part of racetrack), that is near 0.5m, where the curved element does not effect. The calculations in the vicinity of the curved element of current (part of racetrack) and in the vicinity of the linear current element will be done in the succeeding work, wherever possible.

The magnetic system is described in [2] and [3]. But unlike from [2] and [3] we have:

* number of coils is 8 (as for BARREL and for END-CAP);
