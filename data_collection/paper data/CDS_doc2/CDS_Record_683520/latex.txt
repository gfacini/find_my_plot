## 1 Abstract

Scintillator detector "Mu-wall" constructed for measurement of longitudinal and transversal leakage of hadronic showers from the TILECAL prototype is described. The detector was used during 1994 - 1995 test beam measurements of the TILECAL prototype. Different configurations of the "Mu-wall" detectors used during the test beam measurements are summarized.

## 2 Introduction

Measurements [1][2] showed a quite large probability of hadron showers punchthrough. Because the TILECAL prototype [3] of ATLAS barrel and exetended barrel hadron calorimeter has innovative concept of "longitudinal" segmentation of active and passive layers, the measurement of hadron showers punchthrough probability was of special interest.

The "Mu-wall" detectors

Basic elements of the "Mu-wall" are plastic scintillator detectors with dimensions 20x40x2 \(cm^{3}\) which are read-out by 2-inch photomultipliers EMI 9813KB. The scintillators were produced by Chemicals and Technolgy, Prague and their characteristics are similar to NE110.

The backward "Mu-wall" was fixed on a mechanical support independently on the TILECAL prototype and placed behind the calorimeter to register longitudinal leakage. It consisted of up to 9 scintillator detectors and covered the area of about 0.8x0.8 \(m^{2}\).

Six scintillator detectors of the side "Mu-wall" with its mechanical support were fixed to one side of the central module of the TILECAL prototype to measure lateral leakage of hadronic showers. The side "Mu-wall" covered the area of 1.15x0.4 \(m^{2}\).

Schematical picture of the "Mu-wall" detector is shown on Fig.1.
