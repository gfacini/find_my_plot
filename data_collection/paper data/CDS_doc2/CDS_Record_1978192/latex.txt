## 1 Introduction

This note compares several Monte Carlo (MC) event generators used in the Higgs boson analyses. This material will be presented and discussed during the Higgs (N)NLO MC and Tools Workshop [1], taking place at CERN on December 17\({}^{\text{th}}\)-19\({}^{\text{th}}\) 2014.

In the following, updated MC status is presented for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson production channels gluon-fusion, \(VH\) and \(ttH/tH\) and for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) Higgs modes. Furthermore, studies of \(t\bar{t}\) and \(t\bar{t}\) plus heavy flavor processes, which are important background for \(t\bar{t}H\) analyses, are presented. MC samples are generated with a center-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=8\) or 13 TeV.

## 2 Gluon-fusion Higgs-boson Production

### Simulated Samples

All MC samples in this section are generated at a center-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV.

The main sample under investigation is a sample of Higgs boson production via gluon fusion generated with Powheg NNLOPS [2]. To produce this sample, the Higgs-boson-plus-jet (HJ) Powheg MiNLO [3] sample generated with Powheg-v2 [4] is combined with an NNLO accurate inclusive calculation by the program HNNLO (v.1.3) [5, 6, 7] following the instructions in Ref. [2]. Here, an event-by-event re-weighting of the Powheg HJ MiNLO sample is performed utilizing the Higgs-boson rapidity spectrum from HNNLO, depending on the values in rapidity and transverse momentum of the Higgs boson in the event. By construction fully inclusive observables (\(\sigma_{\text{tot}}\), \(y(H)\), \(m(\ell\ell)\) have NNLO accuracy in the Powheg NNLOPS sample. The HJ production is kept at NLO accuracy.

In the HNNLO calculation, the parameters are set as follows:

* \(m_{H}=125.4\) GeV
* Renormalization and factorization scales \(\mu=\mu_{r}=\mu_{f}=m_{H}\)
* PDF set: CT10nnlo [8]

Details to the MiNLOgeneration are given in Table 1. The sample is showered with Pythia8[9] (v.8.175) using the CT10 PDF set and the AU2 tune [10, 11]. The shower settings are chosen such that they are compatible with the samples used in Run 1. No studies and optimizations have been performed on these settings.

As a cross check the parton shower has been aplied to the HJ MiNLO sample, that is produced as input for the NNLOPS prediction, by running Pythia8 (v.8.175). Here, the inclusive Higgs-boson as well as the HJ production are at NLO accuracy. Another Powheg sample, that is used for comparison is a Powheg HJJ MiNLO sample, that is generated with Powheg-HJJ[3]. In this sample, only the HJJ production is at NLO accuracy.

In Table 1 the settings for Powheg and Pythia8 are summarized for all three samples used here. The renormalization and factorization scale choice, the matching and merging to the shower as well as the shower settings are not studied in this note, but taken from the settings used in Run 1. The Powheg HJMiNLO sample uses an older version of Pythia8. It was checked that the effect of the different Pythia8 versions is small.

Another sample that has been investigated is the Higgs boson plus jets with Sherpa (v.2.1.1) [12, 13]. Here, the inclusive Higgs boson production, the Higgs boson plus 1 jet production, and Higgs boson plus 2 jets production processes are calculated at NLO accuracy. The Higgs boson plus 2 jets matrix elements are generated via an MCFM [14] interface within Sherpa. These calculations are combined using the MEPS@NLO method [15, 16]. In addition, Higgs boson plus 3 jets production is generated at LO accuracy and merged to the sample as well. The following settings were used in Sherpa:

* \(m_{H}=125.0\) GeV
* Core renormalization and factorization scales \(\mu=\mu_{r}=\mu_{f}=m_{H}\)
* Merging scale \(\mu_{\rm CKKW}=\sqrt{Q_{\rm cut}/E_{\rm CM}}\) with the merging cut value \(Q_{\rm cut}=20\) GeV and the center-of-mass energy \(E_{CM}=8\) TeV
* PDF set: CT10

The Higgs boson is decayed into \(WW\), where the \(W\) bosons decay leptonically.

All figures in this section comparing generators were made using Rivet v2.2.0 [17].

### Definition of Simulation Truth Objects

All objects are defined at particle level using stable particles, namely particles with a mean lifetime greater than 30 ps. The particle-level lepton is defined as the electron or the muon coming from the reconstructed \(W\) boson decay, i.e. leptons from hadron decays either directly or via a \(\tau\) decay are rejected, while electrons or muons from \(\tau\) decays are accepted. The lepton is dressed with all photons within a cone of \(\Delta R<0.1\). Selected leptons have a transverse momentum of \(p_{\rm T}>15\) GeV and a pseudorapidity of \(|\eta|<2.5\).

Particle level jets are reconstructed using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm, implemented in the FastJet[18] package, with a width parameter of \(R=0.4\). The anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm is infrared and collinear safe. For the clustering, all stable particles, except the selected leptons, neutrinos not originating from hadron decays, and dressing

photons associated with them, are used. Selected jets have a transverse momentum of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) and a rapidity of \(|y|<4.4\).

An event is accepted if exactly two well-separated opposite-charged leptons are found. The overlap-removal criteria are as follows:

* Electrons are removed, if \(\Delta R(e,\mu)<0.1\).
* Subleading electrons are removed, if \(\Delta R(e,e)<0.1\).

The \(W\) bosons in the event are reconstructed by matching the selected leptons with a suitable neutrino. The mass of the combined four momentum of the lepton-neutrino system must be between 10 and 120 with a target mass, that corresponds to the mass of the \(W\) boson. If two \(W\) bosons are successfully reconstructed, the Higgs boson is given by the \(WW\) system.

### Powheg-BOX NNLOPS Prediction

As discussed in Section 2.1, the Powheg NNLOPS sample is constructed by combining the Powheg HJ MiNLO sample and an NNLO prediction by HNNLO. To estimate the influence of the renormalization and factorization scale choices, \(\mu_{r}\) and \(\mu_{f}\), on the prediction, these scales are varied in both the HJ MiNLO prediction and the HNNLO calculation. The default scale in both predictions is chosen to be the mass of the Higgs boson. The scales are changed independently by a factor of 0.5 and 2.0. This study does not take into account the choice of a completely different central scale than the Higgs-boson mass.

The seven points scale scale variations have been evaluated for both HJ MiNLO and HNNLO, concluding that the largest variations are given by setting \(\mu_{r}=\mu_{f}=\mu\). Thus, the following four scale variations are studied in this section:

* \(\mu(\mathrm{HNNLO})=0.5\cdot m_{H}\)
* \(\mu(\mathrm{HNNLO})=2\cdot m_{H}\)
* \(\mu(\mathrm{MINLO})=0.5\cdot\mu_{\mathrm{def.}}(\mathrm{MINLO})\)
* \(\mu(\mathrm{MINLO})=2\cdot\mu_{\mathrm{def.}}(\mathrm{MINLO})\)

In Table 2, the inclusive cross sections derived from the Powheg NNLOPS prediction are compared with the default and the four scale variations. The variation in the inclusive cross section is driven by the scale in the HNNLO calculation.

Figure 1 displays the absolute differential cross sections of kinematic properties of the undecayed Higgs boson with Pythia8 status code 62; the number of jets, and of the transverse momentum of the leading jet

\begin{tabular}{c c c} \hline Scale HNNLO & Scale MiNLO & Cross section [pb] \\ \hline \(m_{H}\) & \(\mu_{\mathrm{def.}}(\mathrm{MINLO})\) & 16.91 \\ \(0.5\cdot m_{H}\) & \(\mu_{\mathrm{def.}}(\mathrm{MINLO})\) & 18.65 \\ \(2.0\cdot m_{H}\) & \(\mu_{\mathrm{def.}}(\mathrm{MINLO})\) & 15.24 \\ \(m_{H}\) & \(0.5\cdot\mu_{\mathrm{def.}}(\mathrm{MINLO})\) & 16.90 \\ \(m_{H}\) & \(2.0\cdot\mu_{\mathrm{def.}}(\mathrm{MINLO})\) & 16.91 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

for the discussed samples. Here, the jets are selected following the criteria described in Section 2.2. This figure and all other figures in this section were made using Rivet v2.2.0 [17].

In Fig. 2 the normalized differential cross sections are shown for the same properties. The scale choice in the MiNLO prediction influences the shape of the transverse momentum distribution of the Higgs boson and the jets as well as of the distribution of the number of jets.

Furthermore, the first and second jet veto efficiencies, \(\epsilon_{0}\) and \(\epsilon_{1}\), are shown as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{cut}}\) in Fig. 2. The jet veto efficiencies are the efficiencies after requiring zero jets in the event (\(\epsilon_{0}\)) or after requiring no more than one jet in the event (\(\epsilon_{1}\)). They are given by the fraction of the exclusive cross section in events with zero (one) jet over the total inclusive cross section \(\sigma_{\mathrm{total}}\) and are defined as follows:

\[\epsilon_{0}(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{cut}})=\frac{\sigma_{0}(p_{ \mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{cut}})}{\sigma_{\mathrm{total}}} \tag{1}\] \[\epsilon_{1}(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{cut}})=\frac{\sigma_{1}(p_{ \mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{cut}})}{\sigma_{\mathrm{total}}(1-\epsilon_{0}(p_{ \mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{sel}}))} \tag{2}\]

where \(\sigma_{0}(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{cut}})\) is the exclusive cross section with a veto on jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{cut}}\), and \(\sigma_{1}(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{cut}})\) is the exclusive cross section with a veto on additional jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{cut}}\) given that there is already a jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{sel}}\). Here, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{sel}}\) is chosen to be 30 GeV.

In Tables 3 and 4 the resulting uncertainties from the scale variations for different cut scenarios are shown. Table 3 takes into account the normalization uncertainty arising from the NNLO cross section calculation as well as the uncertainties arising from the different cut efficiencies for each scale variation. In Table 4 only the effect from the different cut efficiencies is shown.

### Comparisons between Powheg and Sherpa

In this section basic kinematic event properties are compared for the Powheg NNLOPS samples, the Powheg HJ and HJJ MiNLO samples, and the Sherpa MEPS@NLO sample. For this comparisons the Higgs boson is decayed to \(WW\) where both \(W\) bosons decay leptonically. The object definition and selection criteria described in Sec. 2.2 are applied. All figures in this section were again made using Rivet.

In Fig. 4 the transverse momentum and the rapidity of the reconstructed Higgs boson are shown. Furthermore, the number of jets in the event as well as the jet veto efficiencies are shown. Nice agreement is observed for the Higgs rapidity. The transverse momentum of the Higgs boson is hardest for the Sherpa sample followed then by the Powheg HJJ sample. Again, the Powheg NNLOPS prediction is the softest in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}(H)\). Also the zero jets fraction is highest for Powheg NNLOPS as well as the jet veto efficiency \(\epsilon_{0}\). In addition, the transverse momentum of the reconstructed \(W\) bosons and the angular distance between the two reconstructed \(W\) bosons are shown.

The jet properties for the leading, subleading, and third-leading jet are shown in Fig. 5. Here, the transverse momentum spectra are harder for Sherpa than those of Powheg samples. Also, jets are produced more forward in Sherpa than in PowhegThis is a known characteristic of Sherpa v2.1.1, that is currently under investigation.

Nice agreement is seen in kinematic properties of the di-jet signature in Fig. 6 between the Powheg samples. Some differences between Powheg and Sherpa are also visible in kinematic properties of the di-jet signature, especially in \(\Delta y(j_{1},j_{2})\) and in \(m(j_{1}j_{2})\). In Fig. 7 the kinematics of the leptons are shown. The pseudorapidity of both leptons are agreeing nicely for all predictions. Again, the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectra are harder in Sherpa compared to the other predictions.

To quantify the information given in the Figures, the ratios of quantities for the different samples are compared. In Table 6 ratios of the transverse momentum and rapidity of the reconstructed Higgs boson

In Figure 5(d) the difference in the azimuthal angle between the dijet and dilepton system are shown. The distributions are normalized to unit area. The yellow uncertainty band corresponds to the MC statistical uncertainty of the baseline sample.

In Figure 6(e) the difference in the azimuthal angle between the leading and subleading lepton is shown, while the transverse momentum of the combined dilepton system is shown in Figure 6(f). The distributions are normalized to unit area. The yellow uncertainty band corresponds to the MC statistical uncertainty of the baseline sample.

### Monte Carlo samples

The \(VH\) signals for \(ZH\to\ell\ell bb\), where \(\ell=e,\mu\), studied on this note are modelled using Monte Carlo (MC) events produced by Powheg-v2 using CT10nlo 1 PDF [8] and showered with Pythia8 (v.8.165) [9] configured with the AU2 tune [10, 11] using the CTEQ6L1 PDF [26] interfaced to Photos[27] for QED final-state.

Footnote 1: Both CT10nlo and CT10 is NLO PDFs. CT10 was updated as CT10nlo in 2012.

Quark initiated \(ZH\) samples have been generated at NLO using Powheg-v2+MiNLO [25] (HZJ). For these samples, the hard scattering scale in the Sudakov form factor is set to the default value of \(m(Z^{*})\), while the factorisation and renormalisation scales are set according to the MiNLO procedure to the transverse momentum of the \(Z^{*}\) with \(Z^{*}\to HZ\).

The \(ZH\) production process has a non-negligable contribution from \(gg\to ZH\). Gluon initiated \(ZH\) events have been generated using Powheg-v2 (gg2H).The renormalization and factorization scales have been set to the default values in Powheg for this process (\(\mu_{f}=\mu_{r}=m_{Z}+m_{H}\)).

In the Powheg+Pythia8 (gg2H) and Powheg+MiNLO+Pythia8 (HZJ) samples studied in Run 1 [28] (and shown in section 3.3).The relevant parameters are:

* SpaceShower:pTmaxMatch = 0
* TimeShower:pTmaxMatch = 1
* TimeShower:QEDshowerByL off (forbid photon radiation from leptons)

For the Run 2 studies in section 3.4, new samples have been generated at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 8 TeV and \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV. The differences with respect to the samples described above are the version of Pythia8 (updated to v.8.186), the PDF used for the hard scattering (CT102), the shower scheme, and Photos has not been used. In these samples the main31 scheme has been used. The main31 algorithm, developed by the Pythia8 authors, provides a more accurate shower scheme for the Powheg generator. This algorithm has been used to apply a vetoed showering to the Powheg matrix element: a veto is applied on the Pythia8 parton shower emissions that Powheg should have already covered. The relevant settings are listed below:

Footnote 2: The difference between the CT10 and the CT10nlo has been found negligable

* POWHEG:pTdef = 1
* POWHEG:emitted = 0
* POWHEG:pTemt = 0
* POWHEG:pTHard = 2
* POWHEG:vetoCount = 3
* Main31:NFinal = process dependent
* SpaceShower:pTmaxMatch = 2
* TimeShower:pTmaxMatch = 2The NFinal parameter is the number of final state particles for the "core process" (_i.e._ before resonances' decays), so its value is set to 2 or 3 for the ggHZ and HZJ processes respectively. The SpaceShower and TimeShower parameters ensure the usage of "power showers": this means that the shower emission is allowed up to the kinematical limit. The default Powheg settings include an \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}=\infty\), meaning that the resummation is performed for all values of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the emission.

In addition, MadGraph5_aMC@NLO[29]\(ZH\) samples have been studied for \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. MadGraph5_aMC@NLO is particularly interesting because it has recently added the possibility to generate NLO samples with effective lagrangians [30]. In the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO generated samples, the factorisation and renormalisation scales are set to \(m(Z^{*})\).

The MadGraph5_aMC@NLO samples have been generated using the CT10 PDF and showered with Pythia8 (v.8.186), using the same tune used for Powheg. The matching scheme uses the global-recoil setting, with the following relevant parameters:

* SpaceShower:pTmaxFudge = 1
* SpaceShower:MEcorrections = off
* TimeShower:pTmaxMatch = 1
* TimeShower:pTmaxFudge = 1
* TimeShower:MEcorrections = off
* TimeShower:globalRecoil = on
* TimeShower:limitPTmaxGlobal = on
* TimeShower:nMaxGlobalRecoil = 1
* TimeShower:globalRecoilMode = 2
* TimeShower:nMaxGlobalBranch = 1

The global recoil scheme ensures that the recoil of an emission generated by the parton shower is shared among all final state particles. Matrix element corrections are not suitable for a global recoil scheme, hence they are switched off. The other settings allow the proper use of "wimpy showers" (pTmaxMatch, pTmaxFudge), and provide the additional parameters required to set up the global recoil scheme.

A summary of all the samples used in this section, and the parameters, is reported in Table 8.

### Common definition of truth objects and event selection

All objects are defined at particle level using the same defintions used in section 2.2. The transverse momentum of the leptons and jets have been lowered to \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}>7\) GeV and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{j}>20\) GeV to mimic the event selection in Ref. [28]. In addition, the \(|\eta|\) range is slightly different : \(|\eta^{j}|<5\). A jet is "tagged" as \(p\)" if there is a \(B\)-hadron with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>5\) GeV within \(\Delta R=0.3\) of the jet.

The event selection in section 3.4 is:

* 2 electrons
* 2 tagged jets, both with \(\eta<2.5\)* remove the jets with \(\Delta R<0.2\) from one of the selected electrons.

In the 8 TeV studies in section 3.3, additional requirements on the object and on the event selection have been used. The objects and event selection has been designed to mimic as much as possible the selections adopted in Ref. [28]. This means that the leptons have been categorized into 2 classes: the one used to build the \(Z\) candidate ("tight" electrons or muons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV), and the one used to veto events with additional leptons ("loose" electrons or muons). In addition, an overlap removal between objects has been used:

* remove jets overlapping with electrons (\(\Delta R<0.4\));
* remove jets overlapping with muons with muon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV (\(\Delta R<0.4\));
* remove muons overlapping with jets with muon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<25\) GeV (\(\Delta R<0.4\));
* remove electrons overlapping with muons (\(\Delta R<0.2\)).

For both tight and loose leptons, additional requirements on the isolation from charged particles have been used (more stringent for "tight" leptons). Only events with 2 same-flavour (one tight, one loose) leptons are used in the studies reported in this note.

Events are required to have:

* 2 same-flavour (one tight, one loose) leptons;
* 2 tagged jets, both with \(|\eta|<2.5\);
* no additional jets with \(2.5<|\eta|<5\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV;
* \(83\) GeV \(<m(ll)<99\) GeV for the 2-leptons category;

For all the plots, the \(Z\) and the Higgs candidate are built, event by event, from the 2 leptons and from the leading 2 \(b\)-jets respectively.

### Scale dependence of the \(p_{\rm T}^{\,Z}\) distributions in the \(Zh\to\ell\ell bb\) samples

In preparation of the analysis described in Ref. [28], a dedicated set of studies has been performed to investigate how the factorization and renormalization scale dependence, PDF uncertainties, parton shower details and the hadronization and underlying event models impact the description of the signal.

As observed in Ref. [25], the Powheg+MiNLO independent scale variation is in general larger than the NLO+PS predictions in \(VH\). Since the scale uncertainties on the overall cross sections have been evaluated at the NNLO+NLO(EW) 3, there is an interest to check the impact of the scale variations in Powheg+MiNLO on the acceptance and on the shape of the distributions of kinematic variables used in Ref. [28].

Footnote 3: The total cross sections and systematic uncertainties for the Higgs mass productions considered in Ref. [28] are taken from Ref. [31] and the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) decay branching ratios come from Ref. [31, 32]. The central values of the cross sections are calculated at next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) in QCD corrections [33] and next-to-leading-order (NLO) in electroweak (EW) corrections [34] assuming factorization between the production of a virtual \(V^{\star}\) boson and its decay to \(VH\). The decay branching ratios of \(W^{\pm}\) and \(Z\) bosons are taken from the Review of Particle Physics [35] assuming lepton universality.

The change of the acceptance and of the \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm Z}\) distributions are evaluated with samples generated with Powheg+MiNLO+Pythia8 for HZJ and with Powheg+Pythia8 for ggZH (shown here for completeness). The renormalization (\(\mu_{R}\)) 4 and factorization (\(\mu_{F}\)) 5 scales have been varied independently by factors of 2 and 0.5 in all possible combinations whilst maintaining \(0.5\leq\mu_{R}/\mu_{F}\leq 2.0\). Each sample has been normalized to the nominal cross section calculated at the NNLO+NLO(EW). By comparing each sample with the nominal one (\(\mu_{R}=\mu_{F}=1\)), the acceptance has a change of 1% - 4%.

Footnote 4: ’rescfact’ parameter.

The comparisons of the \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm Z}\) distributions have been done by normalizing each sample to unit area. A linear fit was performed to envelop the most deviated samples compared with the nominal. Figure 8 shows the change in shape for quark initiated \(ZH\), and \(gg\to ZH\) in 2-jet events. As expected, the distribution for \(gg\to ZH\) as a peak for \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm Z}\) close to the mass of the top-quark. As shown, a non negligable change in the shape of \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm Z}\) is induced by the renormalization and factorization scales variation. The change becomes of the order of 5%-10% for \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm Z}>300\) GeV. In Run 1 the region with \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm Z}>200\) GeV gave an important contribution to the search of the Higgs boson in the associated production, and it will play a bigger role for Run 2, making these deviations in shape particularly intersting.

### Comparison of the Run 2 \(ZH\to\ell\ell bb\) samples

The performed comparisons for the production for Run 2 are:

* First checks of the relative contribution of the \(gg\to ZH\) at \(\sqrt{s}=\)13 TeV;
* 8 TeV vs. 13 TeV comparison of the shape of the variables used in the multivariate approach in Ref. [28] for Powheg+MiNLO+Pythia8;
* Powheg+MiNLO+Pythia8 vs. MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 comparison.

The first comparison is between \(gg\to ZH\) and quark-initiated \(ZH\) for \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV and \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. The interst is mostly in the \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm Z}\) distribution, which highlights the increase of contribution from the \(gg\) initiated process for \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. Figure 9 shows the \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm Z}\) distribution, normalised to the cross section estimated by Powheg+Pythia8. It can be seen that, while for 8 TeV, the relative contribution from \(gg\to ZH\) estimate by Powheg+Pythia8 was of the order of 15% for \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm Z}\) of 150 GeV, it becomes of the order of 25% at 13 TeV. Since the \(gg\to ZH\) is affected by bigger uncertainties than the quark initiated one, it will contribute significantly to the theoretical error unless improvements can be made in its calculation.

The comparison of the 8 TeV vs. 13 TeV predictions, and Powheg+MiNLO+Pythia8 vs. MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8, have been performed on different objects and variables (boson candidates, jets, and kinematic variables used in the multivariate discriminant in Ref. [28] ).

For the 8 TeV vs. 13 TeV comparison, the interest is in the change of shape of the variables, to get first information on how much the expected signals will change in Run 2 compared with Run 1. For this reason, the distributions are normalized to unit area. The plots on the left on Figures 10-12 show the shape comparison between 8 TeV and 13 TeV for Powheg+MiNLO+Pythia8 for different objects and variables.

As expected, the \(p_{\rm T}\) distributions are harder for the 13 TeV sample, in particular the \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm Z}\). Another interesting feature is on the number of jets. The 13 TeV sample has many more jets per event than the 8 TeV one. Most of the other distributions show a good agreement.

In the comparisons of Powheg+MiNLO+Pythia8 vs. MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8, it is interesting to have a first check of the agreement of different techniques for the NLO+PS predictions. To checkthe normalizations and the shape variations, the distributions have been normalised to the cross section estimated by each generator. Some preliminary comparisons between Powheg+MiNLO+Pythia8 HZJ and Powheg+Pythia8 HZ have been done, and the main differences among the two have been found on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution of the second additional jet in the event. The plots on the right on Figures 10-12 show the shape comparison between Powheg+MiNLO+Pythia8 and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 for different objects and variables.

It is interesting to notice that some of the variables are slightly different, in particular the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the first additional jet, and the number of jets in the event. These effects could come from the fact that Powheg+MiNLO+Pythia8 implements an NLO calculation for the first additional jet emission.

### Summary

The experience from the 8 TeV studies on scale dependencies in Powheg+MiNLO showed some shape dependence on important variables like the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\). The variations on the shapes are of the order of 5%-10% in the high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\) region which is particularly interesting for Run 1 an future analyses. The first tests and comparisons between 8 and 13 TeV samples show interesting peculiarities on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum of the vector boson and of the Higgs boson, and in particular it highlights the contribution of the \(gg\to ZH\) process

for higher center of mass energy collisions. A first comparison of Powheg and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO shows an overall agreement, in particular for description of the kinematic of the two bosons with some deviation on the description of the additional jets. The quality of the agreement between Powheg and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO gives some additional confidence for future studies with effective lagrangian parametrizations in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO.

## 4 Studies for \(t\bar{t}H\) and \(tH\) analysis

### \(t\bar{t}H\) with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO

In the search for the Higgs boson production in association with a pair of top quarks, an accurate modelling of this process is essential in order to distinguish the signal from the overwhelming background. Indeed, the modelling of the signal process and its main background, \(t\bar{t}\)+jets, are the major systematic uncertainties in this search.

MadGraph5_aMC@NLO[29] provides theory predictions with NLO QCD accuracy (NLO electroweak corrections will become available soon) and also an automatic matching of NLO events with various parton showers. Automation refers to the ability of MadGraph5_aMC@NLO to calculate the matrix elements and to match those to parton shower programs (such as Pythia8[9] and Herwig++[36, 37]). The MadGraph5_aMC@NLO package is based on the MadFKS framework[38] that uses the FKS substraction method[39]. The virtual corrections are handled by the MadLoop code[40]. To match the results with parton shower programs, the MC@NLO method is used. Spin correlation effects for both the decay and the production of generated particles can be included using MadSpin[41].

Two MadGraph5_aMC@NLO sample have been simulated at 8 TeV using the CT10 PDF set[42], a Higgs mass of 125 GeV and dynamic scale \(\mu_{0}=\mu_{R}=\mu_{F}=\frac{m_{\mathrm{T}}(t)+m_{\mathrm{T}}(\bar{t})+m_{ \mathrm{T}}(H)}{2}\), interfaced with Herwig++. The top quark is decayed using MadSpin, while the Higgs boson is decayed during the parton shower, allowing for all possible decay modes. Table 9 summarizes the settings used in the simulations. Dynamic scales are used for the simulations with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO. The renormalisation and factorisation scales are both equal to the sum of the transverse momentum of all final state particles divided by two.

To validate the generation procedure for the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO sample, basic object kinematic distributions and event properties have been compared with the baseline \(t\bar{t}H\) samples used during Run 1. The baseline samples used during Run 1 were PowHel samples.

* The NLO PowHel sample interfaced with Pythia8 was used for the \(t\bar{t}H\) analyses at 8 TeV.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c} \hline \hline  & \(t\bar{t}H\), \(\sqrt{s}\)=8 TeV, m\({}_{H}\)= 125 GeV, m\({}_{t}\)= 172.5 GeV \\ \hline ME gen. & MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO v2.2.1+MadSpin & PowHel (\(h_{\mathrm{damp}}=\mathrm{inf}\)) \\ \hline PS/UE gen. & Herwig++ & Pythia8 (no main31) \\  & v2.7.1 & v8.175 \\ Ren./Fac. scale & \(\frac{m_{\mathrm{T}}(t)+m_{\mathrm{T}}(\bar{t})+m_{\mathrm{T}}(H)}{2}\) & \(m_{t}+m_{H}/2\) \\ ME \& PS/UE PDF & CT10 \& CTEQ6L1 \\ Tune & UE-EE-5[43] & AU2[10, 11] \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 9: Summary of the settings used for the simulated of MadGraph5_aMC@NLO \(t\bar{t}H\) samples.

* The PowHel package is based on computed NLO matrix element calculations provided by HelacNLO[44] and adopts the FKS subtraction scheme.
* The Powheg[45] serves as interface between the NLO calculation and the parton shower programs.
* The CT10nlo PDF set was used, a Higgs mass of 125 GeV and static scale \(\mu_{0}=\mu_{R}=\mu_{F}=\frac{m_{t}+m_{j}+m_{H}}{2}=235\) GeV which corresponds to the scale used in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO samples in the zero momentum limit.

Only events in which the Higgs boson decays to \(b\bar{b}\) have been selected for the validation. A basic event selection at truth level is applied to both the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and the PowHel samples, studying separately the dilepton and single lepton \(t\bar{t}\) decay channels. To distinguish the two decay channels, the number of true leptons from the \(W\) boson decays are used. The studies presented here are based on particles that are assigned to the hardest subprocess after radiation. The performed studies are based on these particles on truth level. Particle jets are reconstructed using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [46] with the recombination radius parameter \(R=0.4\) as described in Section 2.2. A cut of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) is applied to the reconstructed jets.

Figures 13 and 14 show a comparison of the normalized momentum and pseudo-rapidity distributions for the top quark, Higgs boson, \(t\bar{t}\) and \(t\bar{t}H\) systems. In general, a reasonable good agreement is seen between MadGraph5_aMC@NLO interfaced with Herwig++ and PowHel interfaced with Pythia8.

Good agreement between the two predictions is observed for the kinematic properties of the top decay products, as shown in Figure 15 for the \(b\)-quark and the charged lepton for lepton+jets events. Figure 16 shows the number of jets in the event as well as the scalar sum of their momentum also for lepton+jets events. Both simulations are in good agreement.

To study the impact of the inclusion of spin correlations in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, observables sensitive to top spin effects are investigated in the dilepton channel. Figure 17 shows the three-dimensional

polar angle, \(\cos\theta(\ell^{+},\ell^{-})\), between the two charged leptons in two different reference frames. In the first case both leptons are in the laboratory frame, while in the second case the positively charged lepton is in the top quark rest frame and the negatively charged lepton in the rest frame of the antitop quark. As it can be seen, the right distribution is particularly different for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and PowHel. When neglecting the spin polarization effects or in uncorrelated systems, the distribution is flat while a

clear slope is observed for the \(t\bar{t}H\) signal generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO.

Given that it is not possible to validate using data the generator and parton shower setup for \(t\bar{t}H\) signal simulation, the \(t\bar{t}\) process which is the main background to \(t\bar{t}H\), \(H\to b\bar{b}\) has been simulated with the same MadGraph5_aMC@NLO setup at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV.

The current default \(t\bar{t}\) sample used in the majority of ATLAS analyses is generated using the Powheg NLO generator [47, 44, 48] with the CT10 PDF set, an assumed top quark mass of 172.5 GeV and \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}=\infty\). It is interfaced to Pythia6 (v.6.425) [49] with the CTEQ6L1 [50] set of parton distribution functions and the Perugia2011C [51] underlying event tune. The measurement of the \(t\bar{t}\) differential cross sections at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [52] showed deviations of the Powheg+Pythia6 prediction from the unfolded data. In the \(t\bar{t}H\) analysis [53] a correction is applied to simulated \(t\bar{t}\) events in Powheg+Pythia6 based on the ratio of measured differential cross sections at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV between data and the simulation as a function of top quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(t\bar{t}\) system \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). This significantly improves the agreement between simulation and data in the total number of jets (driven mostly by \(t\bar{t}\) system \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) reweighting) and jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (driven mostly by the top quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) reweighting).

Recent studies [54] showed that Powheg+Pythia6 prediction provides a better description of data if \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) parameter is set to \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\). Figure 18 shows several distributions in which the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO sample interfaced with Herwig++ is compared with the Powheg (\(h_{\mathrm{damp}}=m_{\mathrm{top}}\)) interfaced with Pythia6. The samples are compared to unfolded ATLAS data via the use of different Rivet routines. The first

two distributions show the differential jet shapes separately for light and \(b\)-jets with 50 GeV \(<p_{\rm T}<\) 70 GeV also in the lepton+jets channel [54]. In the bottom, the gap fraction observables \(f(Q_{0})\) (defined as \(f(Q_{0})=\frac{n(Q_{0})}{N}\) when \(N\) is the number of selected events and \(n(Q_{0})\) the subset of events that do not contain an additional high-\(p_{\rm T}\) jet with transverse momentum, \(p_{\rm T}\), above a threshold \(Q_{0}\)) and \(f(Q_{\rm sum})\) (defined as \(f(Q_{\rm sum})=\frac{n(Q_{\rm sum})}{N}\) where \(n(Q_{\rm sum})\) is the number of events in which the scalar transverse momentum of the additional high-\(p_{\rm T}\) jets is less than \(Q_{\rm sum}\)) are shown for dilepton events [55]. The gap fraction variables are sensitive to the modelling of the additional parton radiation in \(t\bar{t}\) final states. The gap fraction defined using \(Q_{0}\) is mainly sensitive to the leading-\(p_{\rm T}\) emission accompanying the \(t\bar{t}\) system, while the one defined using \(Q_{\rm sum}\) is mainly sensitive to all hard emissions.

### Comparison of the \(t\bar{t}\) simulation by Sherpa and Powheg+Pythia6

The Sherpa package provides an opportunity to simulate \(t\bar{t}H\) and \(t\bar{t}\) processes at LO and NLO. To understand the performance of Sherpa initial set of studies presented here was performed for \(t\bar{t}\) process which can be validated using data.

Three \(t\bar{t}\) samples are generated with Sherpa version 2.1.1 [12] at \(\sqrt{s}=\)8 TeV:

Figure 18: The MadGraph5_aMC@NLO samples are compared with the Powheg (\(h_{\rm damp}=m_{\rm top}\))+Pythia6 (tune Perugia2011) in \(t\bar{t}\) events: the jet shapes in the lepton+jets channel and gap fraction observables in dilepton channel. The data are represented as closed (black) circles with statistical uncertainties. The theoretical predictions are shown as solid and dashed coloured lines. The yellow band in the ratio plot in the bottom part is the total experimental uncertainty on the data (statistical and systematic) [54, 55].

* The S-MC@NLO 6 sample: the \(t\overline{t}\) process with no additional partons is calculated at NLO QCD accuracy and matched to the parton shower using the MC@NLO prescription detailed in Ref. [56]. Footnote 6: S-MC@NLO stands for Sherpa-MC@NLO.
* The MEPS@LO sample: \(t\overline{t}\) productions with up to three additional partons, calculated at LO QCD accuracy, are merged and matched to parton shower following the ME+PS method detailed in Ref. [57].
* The MEPS@NLO sample: \(t\overline{t}\) productions with zero or one additional parton are calculated at NLO QCD accuracy. They are merged with \(t\overline{t}\) productions with two, three and four additional partons which are calculated at LO accuracy and matched to parton shower. This MEPS@NLO prescription represent state-of-the-art procedures for Monte Carlo generators and is described in Ref. [15]

The renormalisation scale is computed following the MEPS procedure [15]. OpenLoops[12, 58] framework is used to produce S-MC@NLO and MEPS@NLO samples. Table 10 provides a summary of the Sherpa parameters used to generate the samples.

Shepa samples are produced within the ATLAS software [59]. They are compared to the default \(t\overline{t}\) Powheg+Pythia6 samples corrected based on the ratio of measured differential cross sections at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV between data and the simulation as a function of top quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(t\overline{t}\) system \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) as described in Section 4.1. The top quark decays almost exclusively to a \(b\) quark and a \(W\) boson. Events where one \(W\) boson decays leptonically and the other \(W\) boson decays hadronically are selected. This selected sample is referred to as the lepton+jets sample in what follows.

Jets are reconstructed with the infrared- and collinear-safe anti-kt algorithm [46] with radius parameter \(R=0.4\), implemented in the FastJet package [18] Stable truth particles are used as input to the jet algorithm. Electrons, muons and neutrinos originating from \(W\) bosons decay are excluded. The decay products of \(\tau\)-leptons originating from \(W\) bosons decay are excluded as well. This procedure prevents overlaps between jets and the \(W\) boson leptonic decay products. Jets are reconstructed with a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold of 5 GeV. Particles used to form jets are selected with \(|\eta|<5\) and with no \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) requirement.

The \(W\) bosons and the top quarks are reconstructed using the correct combination of jets and leptons. The matching algorithm finds jet-quark pairs with closest distance \(\Delta R\) and with a requirement on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ratio between the jet and the quark: \(0.5<p_{\mathrm{T}}(\mathrm{jet})/p_{\mathrm{T}}(\mathrm{quark})<2\). Several kinematic variables are compared between the different samples. The scalar sum of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of all jets (\(H_{\mathrm{T}}\)) with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<5\) is shown in Figure 19. \(H_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the number of jets is also shown after excluding jets originating from

top quarks and \(W\) bosons decay. For \(H_{\mathrm{T}}\), S-MC@NLO is softer than Powheg+Pythia6 (corrected) while Sherpa MEPS@LO is harder. Sherpa MEPS@NLO is compatible with Powheg+Pythia6 (corrected). Both Sherpa MEPS samples have larger jet multiplicity than Powheg+Pythia6 (corrected). The effect is significant only in the very large multiplicity region which is not, a priori, constrained by data. All generators are compatible within 10% when considering \(t\overline{t}\) production with up to four additional jets.

The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the \(t\overline{t}\) system and the \(\Delta R\) between the top and the anti-top quark are shown in Figure 20. The behaviour of the differences between the samples for the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}(t\overline{t})\) distribution is similar to \(H_{\mathrm{T}}\). Sherpa MEPS have larger tails at small value of \(\Delta R(t,\overline{t})\) compared to Powheg+Pythia6 (corrected) while S-MC@NLO has smaller tails in the same region.

The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the leading and the sub-leading top (or anti-top) quarks are shown in Figure 21. Deviations can be seen in both the low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the large \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) regions however the statistical uncertainties are large to be able to draw a definite conclusion. Sherpa MEPS@LO and S-MC@NLO predict a higher cross-section than Powheg+Pythia6 at low and high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for the leading top. This effect can be seen only at large \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for the sub-leading top. Sherpa MEPS@NLO prediction seems to be compatible with the one from the corrected Powheg+Pythia6 sample.

More details can be found in section 4.2.

### \(t\bar{t}\) plus heavy flavor production model

#### 4.3.1 \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) Background

The modelling of the irreducible \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) background, and the related uncertainties play a key role in the \(t\bar{t}H\) search. The implementation of the latest theoretical developments is therefore of critical importance.

Fixed order NLO calculations for \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) production can reduce perturbative uncertainties from 70-80% down to 15-20% [60, 61, 62]. Fully matched NLO predictions with massive \(b\)-quarks have also become available recently within the Sherpa+OpenLoops framework [12, 58]. In order to improve the modelling, the \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) prediction in the default Powheg+Pythia6 sample described in Section 4.1 is compared to state of the art NLO \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) samples produced with Sherpa 2.1 based on four-flavour CT10 PDFs with massive \(b\)-quarks and including top quark decays simulated using Sherpa decay afterburner, including spin correlations. The one-loop matrix elements have been generated with OpenLoops[58]. The detailed settings are described in Ref. [63]. The comparison also includes Powheg+Herwig used in the \(t\bar{t}H\) analysis to evaluate parton shower systematics, Sherpa MEPS@NLO described in Section 4.2 and MadGraph+Pythia6.

The MadGraph sample is a fully inclusive sample of \(t\bar{t}\)-events with up to 3 additional partons. The top-quark decay takes place in the showering step, which is carried out using Pythia v6.426 [49] with the Perugia2011C tune. This implies that top quark spin information is not transmitted to its decay products. The events are matched using the MLM-matching algorithm [64]. Table 11 gives a summary of generation parameters. The flag _pdfwgt_ can enable an additional weight that is applied at each radiation vertex, and leads to a harder \(p_{T}\)-spectra and a higher-number of particle-jets. It has been disabled to achieve a better agreement with Powheg+Pythia6.

#### 4.3.2 Heavy flavor definition

Particle jets are defined at truth level, clustering stable particles using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with jet radius R=0.4. Leptons and neutrinos are excluded from the jets. A \(b\)-jet is defined as a jet containing a \(B\)-hadron with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\ >5\) GeV within \(\Delta R<0.4\) of the jet axis. In order to identify additional heavy flavour production, the closest \(B\)-hadron to a \(b\)-quark originated from top decay is excluded. Jets matching these hadrons are

Figure 21: Comparison of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the leading (left) and the sub-leading (right) top (or anti-top) quarks between Sherpa and Powheg+Pythia6 samples. More details can be found in section 4.2.

not considered as additional heavy flavour. A jet can contain more than one \(B\)-hadron, in most cases, from a collinear gluon splitting where the individual \(b\)-quarks are not resolved into separate jets. \(B\)-hadrons inside jets are counted and jets are categorized into single hadron (\(b\)-jet) and double hadron (\(B\)-jet).

The events are then categorized based on the number of heavy flavour particle jets that are not originated from top decays, with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}~{}>\) 15 GeV and \(|\eta|<\) 2.5. For example, \(t\bar{t}\) +bb corresponds to an event with two resolved \(b\)-jets, \(t\bar{t}\) +B is an event with one extra double hadron jet and \(t\bar{t}\) +bB is an event with one extra single hadron and one double hadron jet.

#### 4.3.3 Comparison to NLO prediction

Given the definition of Section 4.3.2, the \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) prediction of Powheg can be compared against NLO predictions. Unfortunately some of the \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) contributions are not included in the NLO prediction. In particular two topologies are identified: \(b\bar{b}\) pairs arising from multiple parton interaction (MPI) overlaying a \(t\bar{t}\) +jets event. And second, gluon to \(b\bar{b}\) splitting where the gluon is radiated from the top decay products. This second contribution is labelled as FSR. These can be added by the parton shower but such final state will contain four \(b\)-quarks in addition to the ones originating from \(t\bar{t}\). The absolute contribution of the various topologies to the cross section is shown in Figure 22. MPI and FSR contributions will be excluded from the comparisons of Sherpa MEPS@NLO, and Sherpa+OpenLoops, since they are not contained in the NLO prediction. Normalized distributions of different relevant variables across categories are shown in Figures 23, 24, 25 and 26. A difference in inclusive \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) cross section is observed with the Powheg prediction being about 20% above Sherpa+OpenLoops. The relative distribution across categories is such that Sherpa+OpenLoops predicts higher contribution of the \(t\bar{t}+B\) category, as well as every category where the production of a second pair of \(b\bar{b}\) is required.

The modelling of the relevant kinematic variables in each category is in reasonable agreement between Powheg and Sherpa+OpenLoops \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\). Some differences are observed in the very low regions of

### \(tH\) process model

The \(tH\) production [65; 66; 67; 68; 69] cross section is not only sensitive to the magnitude of the top Yukawa coupling (\(y_{t}\)), but it is also sensitive to the relative sign of \(y_{t}\) with respect to \(g_{HWW}\) (coupling between Higgs and \(W\)). In the Standard Model (SM), \(tH\) production is suppressed by the destructive interference between \(t\)-channel diagrams with Higgs bosons emitted from top quark and \(W\) boson lines. Three processes contribute to \(tH\) production: \(t\)-channel (\(tHjb\)) production, \(WtH\) production and \(s\)-channel \(tH\) production. The \(s\)-channel production has a much smaller cross section compared to \(tHjb\) and \(WtH\) production. The generator settings used are summarized in Table 12.

#### 4.4.1 \(tHjb\)

The \(tHjb\) samples were generated with MadGraph5[74] in the 4-flavor scheme which provides a better description of the kinematics of the spectator \(b\)-quark than the five-flavor scheme [75]. Renormalization/factorization scales are set to 75 GeV. Pythia8 with AU2 CT10 PDF was used to shower the samples. The 4F scheme is expected to describe \(N_{b-\mathrm{jet}}\) distribution more accurately because the spectator \(b\)-quark appears at LO (so in a NLO 4FS calculation its kinematics is truly at NLO). The 4F scheme vs the 5F scheme comparison is presented in Fig. 27.

Starting from top left, the mass of the extra \(b\)-quarks, top right, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the extra \(b\)-quarks, bottom left, the \(\Delta\)R of the extra \(b\)-quarks, and the bottom right, \(\mathrm{H_{T}}\) of the extra \(b\)-quarks.

Figure 28 shows comparison of MadGraph5 with different PDFs (CTEQ6L1, CT10, MSTW2008). All samples are showered with Herwig++. Then, Fig. 29 shows various shower options, namely Herwig, Pythia6 and Herwig++.

#### \(tWh\)

In the \((t)tH,H\to\gamma\gamma\) ATLAS analysis [76] only central jets are considered, and no requirements are made for forward jets. This strategy is different from what was done in theory papers, which require forward jets (see Refs. [67] and [68]). Therefore, the assumptions in those papers are not valid in our case

The ratio is defined with respect to the LO MadGraph5 sample that uses CTEQ6L1 PDF set (shown in black). The LO MadGraph5 sample that uses CT10 (MSTW2008) PDF set is shown in red (green).

and the \(tWH\) production process cannot be neglected.

It is not possible to generate the \(tWH\) process in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO out-of-the box: the phase-space integration is not converging, because of the \(t\bar{t}H\) channel opening up. Therefore, the diagram removal (DR) is used. However, DR doesn't work with MadSpin, and therefore it was checked using LO \(tWH\) that this effect is negligible. Figure 30 shows the effect of the MadSpin and NLO to some of the distributions of interest, however, requires more MC statistics for further investigation.

#### 4.4.3 \(tW\)

To validate the diagram removal used for \(tWH\) (see Section 4.4.2), MadGraph5_aMC@NLO \(tW\) sample was validated with respect to MC@NLO sample used for \(tW\) in ATLAS Run 1. For both samples CT10 PDF was used. Both samples were showered with Herwig. For MadGraph5_aMC@NLO \(tW\) sample the same diagram removal technique as for the \(tWH\) sample is used. Similarly, MadSpin is not used for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO \(tW\) sample. Results of this comparison are presented in Fig. 31.

### Summary

The top pair production is the main background for the \(t\bar{t}H\) analysis with Higgs decaying to \(b\bar{b}\) pair. The modelling of the \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) component is of particular importance since it is an irreducible background for this channel.

Figure 30: Various \(tWH\) comparisons. Red: \(tWH\) generated at LO with MadSpin, black: \(tWH\) generated at LO without MadSpin (top decays are done in Herwig++), green: \(tWH\) generated at NLO without MadSpin (top decays are done in Herwig++). All samples are generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and showered with Herwig++. \(W_{t}\) is the \(W\) from \(t\to Wh\). \(W_{x}\) is the other \(W\). \(b_{t}\) is the \(b\) from \(t\to Wh\). \(\ell_{W}\) is a lepton from \(W\). Central jets are required to have \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV. The ratio is defined with respect to the LO \(tWH\) sample without MadSpin.

Within the context of 8 TeV analysis several studies were performed using Sherpa+OpenLoops and modeling of \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) in Powheg was corrected to match Sherpa+OpenLoops prediction. Systematic uncertainties on \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) production are based on the parameter variation of Sherpa+OpenLoops simulation.

For Run 2 several studies are being performed to improve modelling of \(t\bar{t}\) background. In particular, samples generated with the new version of Sherpa and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO interfaced with different shower models are under study. First tests show promising results.

To improved the understanding of the \(t\bar{t}H\) signal model studies are ongoing to compare the current model with the one available in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO. The performance of MadGraph5_aMC@NLO depends significantly on the choice of the parton shower. The studies indicate that a dedicated tuning of Pythia8 is required.

## 5 MC studies for BSM Higgs boson searches

### \(b\)-associated Higgs boson production

A comparison for \(b\)-associated Higgs boson production is presented, comparing between Pythia8 and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, for \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. For the Pythia8 sample the PDF used is CTEQ6L1 and the tune is AU2. The study is performed after hadronization. The hadronization in the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [29, 77] samples is performed with Herwig++[36], the PDF here is MRSTML and the tune is UE-EE-4 [71]. Pythia8[9] is used with the "HiggsBSM:gg2A3bbbar" option. The generator settings are listed in Table 13.

MadGraph5_aMC@NLO generates a 4 flavor scheme MC events at NLO. It approximates the MSSM NLO 4FS cross section by the following formula:

\[\sigma=\left(\alpha_{S}^{2}y_{b}^{2}\Delta_{b}^{(0)}+\alpha_{S}^{3}y_{b}^{2} \Delta_{b}^{(1)}\right)+\alpha_{S}^{3}y_{b}y_{t}\Delta_{b}^{(1)}+\mathcal{O}( \alpha_{S}^{4})=\sigma(y_{b}^{2})+\sigma(y_{b}\cdot y_{t})+\mathcal{O}(\alpha _{S}^{4}). \tag{3}\]

Figure 31: \(tW\) comparisons. Red: MC@NLO, Black: MadGraph5_aMC@NLO. The ratio is defined with respect to the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO \(tW\) sample.

Terms that are proportional to \(y_{b}^{2}\) are compared separately to the terms that are proportional to \(y_{b}y_{t}\), where \(y\) denotes the Yukawa coupling and the subscript denotes quark flavor. For each of the three samples (Pythia8, MadGraph5_aMC@NLO \(y_{b}^{2}\) and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO \(y_{b}y_{t}\)) 20000 events are generated for a 500 GeV Higgs boson using a narrow width. The generated width for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO is 6.4 MeV, and that for Pythia8 is 1 GeV. The \(y_{b}\), \(y_{t}\) Yukawa couplings in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO are set to their SM values. The Higgs boson decays to \(\tau\tau\).

Figure 32 shows the Higgs boson \(p_{\rm T}\) as well as number of \(b\)-jets. The \(b\)-jet is reconstructed by using anti-\(k_{\rm t}\) jets from truth particles in which a \(b\)-quark is identified. The radius parameter used in the jet reconstruction is \(R=0.4\).

The distribution comparisons that follow do not use any extra normalization but simply show the number of \(b\)-jets. The number of entries in each histogram is also shown as text on the plots.

Leading and sub-leading \(b\)-jets coming from the bbf are shown in the bottom left and right, respectively. The total number of events in the histograms is shown separately in text format.

However, about the same difference is observed. In Figure 38 the jet multiplicity for 4FS and 5FS using MadGraph5 LO generator (v1.5.12) is displayed

### Interference of BSM heavy Higgs bosons \(gg\to A/H\to tt\) with SM \(gg\to t\bar{t}\)

For this 8 TeV study, the MadGraph5[29] v2.0.1 generator is used at LO. A Higgs Effective Couplings Form Factor model in the 2HDM is used, which is a generic BSM model that has only a scalar H and a pseudoscalar A. The generator settings are summarized in Table 18.

To study the interference, the Higgs Effective Couplings Form Factors model in MadGraph5 requires that all widths and couplings are entered as numerical values. FeynHiggs[78, 79, 80, 81, 82] v2.10.2 is used to derive these numbers. FeynHiggs has the MSSM implemented (which is a subset of the type-II 2HDM), and the following parameters are chosen:

* SUSY loops disabled: \(M_{\rm SUSY}=10\) TeV, \(A_{t}=0\), \(M_{2}=2\) TeV, \(M_{3}=8\) TeV
* \(\tan\beta<2\)

This set of parameters, together with imposing a 100% branching ratio of \(A/H\to t\bar{t}\) through the MadGraph5 process cards, sets up a 2HDM scenario with \(\sin(\beta-\alpha)=1\). The free input parameters are \(m_{A}\) and \(\tan\beta\), which determine \(m_{H}\), the widths, couplings and cross sections. \(\tan\beta\) is tuned to obtain a width of 1, 5 or 10% of the Higgs boson masses. Table 19 lists the chosen mass and \(\tan\beta\) values, together with the MadGraph5 LO signal cross sections.

Three samples are generated using MadGraph5 LO. For this production, no showering of the MC events was performed. The couplings of \(H/A\) to top, bottom and \(\tau\) are the same for each of the three samples.

Table 19: Values of \(\tan\beta\) for \(A\) and \(H\) to obtain a certain relative width for three different Higgs boson masses. The signal cross sections from MadGraph5 (MG) at LO are also given.

In Fig. 39 the \(t\bar{t}\) mass of signal, background and interference are shown for a Higgs boson mass of 500 GeV and a width of 1%. The histograms are scaled such that they correspond to 20 fb\({}^{-1}\) and with the MadGraph5 cross section, therefore they show the expected number of events.

In Fig. 40 the \(t\bar{t}\) mass of signal, background and interference are shown for a Higgs boson mass of 500 GeV and a width of 5%. In Fig. 41 the \(t\bar{t}\) mass of signal, background and interference are shown for a Higgs boson mass of 500 GeV and a width of 10%.

To mimic at least partially the effects of the detector, the \(t\bar{t}\) mass has been smeared with a Gaussian with a mass-dependent resolution, which ranges from 8% for \(m_{t\bar{t}}<400\) GeV and reduces linearly to 6.5% for \(m_{t\bar{t}}>1000\) GeV. In Fig. 42 the \(t\bar{t}\) mass of signal, background and interference are shown for a Higgs boson mass of 500 GeV and a width of 10% when the Gaussian mass resolution smearing was applied. In Fig. 43 the \(t\bar{t}\) mass of signal, background and interference are shown for a Higgs boson mass of 600 GeV and a width of 10%, no smearing is applied.

Conclusion of these studies: Strong interference effects are observed, which cannot be neglected when performing a search for heavy \(A/H\to t\bar{t}\). For the \(A\) boson, the mass peak turns into a flat excess shifted to the left side of the Higgs boson mass, and a huge dip on the right side of the Higgs boson mass appears. For the \(H\) boson, the peak is shifted to the left, and the peak has a slightly lower intensity as the initial signal, and again a dip appears to the right, which has a lower intensity than the dip observed for the case of the \(A\) boson. In the case a smearing is applied, the peaks and dips are flattened out. The interference has an important implication for the searches: A simple bump-hunt is not useful anymore, because the signal peak is flattened out. Instead one could try for example a maximum likelihood fit with a signal shape which has the form of a slight bump followed by a dip, or only look for the dips.

### Summary

MC studies for BSM Higgs boson searches were performed. The \(b\)-associated production was studied comparing MadGraph5 NLO and Pythia8, and expected characteristics are found. The production of charged Higgs bosons in 4FS and 5FS was studied with MadGraph5 NLO for the decay \(H^{+}\to t\bar{b}\), and notable differences in the jet and \(b\)-jet multiplicity as well as in the \(p_{\rm T}\) spectra of the \(b\)-jets were observed. The interference of heavy neutral Higgs bosons \(gg\to A/H\to t\bar{t}\) with the background \(gg\to t\bar{t}\) was studied with MadGraph5 LO MC, and non-negligible effects are observed which have to be taken into account in the search for these new particles.

## 6 Summary

Studies with updated MC generators are presented for the SM Higgs boson production channels gluon-fusion, \(VH\) and \(ttH/tH\), for BSM Higgs modes and for \(t\bar{t}\) and \(t\bar{t}\) plus heavy flavor processes. For Run 2 data analysis, further investigations are needed in partnership with MC generator developers.
