Introduction

Many interesting physics channels, expected to be observed with the ATLAS detector [3] at the LHC [4], will have \(b\)-quarks in the final state. \(b\)-jet tagging will be crucial for SM and MSSM Higgs searches [5, 6], study of the SUSY particles [7, 8] and top-quark decays [9].

The most powerful method of \(b\)-tagging is the vertex method, based on the relatively long lifetime of B-hadrons [1, 10]. The second method is tagging by low-\(p_{T}\) leptons originating from semileptonic decays of \(b\)-quarks [2, 11]. The lepton tags are efficient only for a few percent of \(b\)-jets, because the branching ratio is low for such decays (about 17% per lepton family), but this method can be combined with the vertex algorithm and provide a complement to the overall \(b\)-tagging performance. In this paper combining both methods using the neural network is considered.

## 2 Methods of tagging \(b\)-jets

The capability for efficient identification of high-\(p_{T}\) jets originating from \(b\)-quark fragmentation plays a key role in the analysis of various physical processes expected in ATLAS experiment. Many important physics channels have final states involving \(b\)-quarks, eg.:

* Higgs boson decays, \(H\to b\overline{b}\), from associated \(t\overline{t}H\) production [5]. This decay channel is important for the SM Higgs searches and also for the searches of the Higgs bosons in the MSSM [6]. In this second case large variety of channels \(h\to b\overline{b}\) (\(t\overline{t}h\), \(H\to hh\), \(A\to Zh\)) or \(H^{\pm}\to tb\) can be explored. \(b\)-tagging capability can be also used as a very powerful tool to suppress background (\(bbH\), \(bbA\) production with \(A/H\to\tau\tau,\ \mu\mu\)).
* cascade decays of SUSY particles [7, 8],
* top-quark decays (\(t\to Wb\) and possibly \(t\to WbZ\)) [9].

In all of above processes jets originating from lighter quarks and from gluons are sources of a potentially large background. Therefore the observability of signals in multi-\(b\)-jet final states generally requires a high rejection of non-\(b\) jets and the highest possible efficiency for \(b\)-jet identification.

It was already shown by the CDF [12] and LEP [13] experiments, that powerful b-tagging can be achieved by two independent methods:

* secondary vertex tagging based on the relatively long lifetime of \(B\)-hadrons (around 1.5 \(ps\), i.e. decay distance of several \(mm\)) which gives rise to displaced vertices [1, 10];* soft lepton tagging based on the identification of the soft leptons from semileptonic \(B\)-meson decays [2, 11].

While the efficiency of the vertexing algorithms is only limited by the detector performance, the expected efficiency of the soft lepton tagging method is limited also by the fraction of \(B\)-meson decays containing leptons (\(\approx 17\%\) per lepton family). Nevertheless the identification of soft leptons (electrons, muons) will provide a valuable complement to the much more powerful secondary vertex tagging.

The vertex and soft lepton methods are combined to improve the overall ATLAS \(b\)-tagging performance. First attempt of such studies was presented in [1]. As the rejection power of the vertex method is superior to that of the lepton methods and the lepton tags are efficient only for a few percent of \(b\)-jets, the following method was used to select the 'tagged' events: for each value of the cut on the vertex weight, the cut on the lepton weight is chosen so as to optimise the global performance. For 50% \(b\)-tagging efficiency, the increase in rejection of \(u-\)jets is 0.9%, of \(g-\)jets is 9.6% and of \(c-\)jets is 1.5%.

In this paper another method of combining two tagging algorithms using a neural network is presented. The results reported in [1] and [11] for each algorithm separately are used through this study.

## 3 Using a neural network approach to combine vertex and soft electron tagging methods

The soft electron method of \(b\)-jet tagging is used as a complement to the more powerful secondary vertex tagging. The rejection power of vertex and soft electron tagging methods against background consisting of \(u\)-jets is shown in Fig. 1. The combination of the two \(b\)-jet tagging methods proposed in this paper is using a neural network.

Soft electron and vertex tagging methods are not fully decorrelated, since they use some common information about particles in jets. A neural network2 is used to find a common, combined weight for every jet. The combined weight assigned to the jet is later used to select signal \(b\)-jets out of background.

### Procedure description

Both weights, obtained from the two tagging methods, vertex and soft electron ones, are normalised to the range between zero and one and used as inputs for a neural network. The network consists of two input neurons (vertex and soft electron weights), one 24-neuron hidden layer and one output neuron giving the combined weight. Number of neurons in the hidden layer is chosen in such a way, that it allows to reproduce well the shape of the combined weight distribution, but at the same time the number of neurons is low enough to have the combined weight function relatively smooth. The limited number of neurons protects also against the effect of over learning of the network. The neural network is trained using a subsample of Monte Carlo data (signal \(b-\)jets, background \(u,\ c,\ g-\)jets), while the rest of the data is used for verification. The obtained function of combined weight \(W_{comb}=f(W_{vertex},W_{so\,ft})\) is shown in Fig. 2. As can be expected for low electron tagging weights the resulting combined weight depends on the vertexing only. However, if the soft electron method weight is high enough, also the jets with lower vertexing weight are accepted.

### Results

The rejection power of the combined method as a function of the _b_-jet selection efficiency is shown in Fig. 3 and 4. It is compared with the performance of the pure vertex method. For _u_-jets and _c_-jets one can observe an improvement of the tagging performance (16% and 10% respectively), however for _g_-jets the rejection does not increase. The results are collected in Table 1.

Comparing with the results of the statistical combining soft electron and vertex _b_-jet tagging methods [1], the much better results are obtained with neural network for background _u_- and _c_-jets.

The neural network trained simultaneously on all three background sources is not able to increase the rejection of the gluon jets. However, if the network

\end{table}

is trained to distinguish between the gluon jets and the signal \(b\)-jets only, the rejection becomes better (see Fig. 5). One can observe a distinct improvement of the \(g\)-jets background rejection, but at the same time the rejection against other background sources decreases.

The use of neural network gives a simple method of obtaining a combined weight for each jet, which is used in the further selection. The method can be easily adopted to any improvements in both vertex and soft electron tagging algorithms. It is also important, that with this approach correlations between two tagging methods are taken into account.

## 4 Conclusions

In this paper it was proposed to apply neural network to obtain the common weight coming from soft electron and vertex tagging methods. The parallel use of both methods improves the background rejection by 16% for \(u\)-jets and 10% for \(c\)-jets.

As mentioned in [1], the contribution of the electron method can become even more significant if the rejection of the vertex method is decreased with respect to the values shown in this paper. For example, if the ATLAS Inner

Detector inner-most B-layer was not operational, the 40% decrease of the vertex method rejection power is expected. In addition, the electron tagging can be used as a 'control channel' to study systematic errors on the identification efficiencies.
