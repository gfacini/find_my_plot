###### Abstract

The world average measurement of the \(\tau\) lepton lifetime is currently 290.8\(\pm\) 1.0 fs [1]. Improvements in this measurement would allow better tests of the Standard Model, in particular the universality in the charged currents.

A study of the potential of the ATLAS detector in measuring the \(\tau\) lifetime via the \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\) channel has been already presented [2]. Events can be triggered by requiring one \(\tau\) to decay to muon or electron, while the lifetime can be estimated from the other \(\tau\) which is required to decay to three charged hadrons. If 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) were collected in the low luminosity phase, the collected number of reconstructed \(\tau\)'s would lead to a statistical error on the \(\tau\) lifetime of 1.8 fs.

Here we discuss the possibility of using the \(W\rightarrow\tau\nu\) production channel, which has a higher cross-section and could be triggered by a \(\tau\)-jet and a missing \(E_{T}\) trigger.

## 2 Data samples

The analysis was developed on a fully-simulated sample of \(W\rightarrow\tau\nu\) events. In the generated events, the \(\tau\) lepton is required to decay to hadrons. A selection cut was applied to the generated events before Geant tracking. Only the events with the hadronic component of the decay fulfilling the following requirements:

\(\bullet\)\(p_{T}>30\) GeV,

\(\bullet\)\(|\)\(\eta\)\(|<2.5\),

were tracked, with an acceptance of 11.5% of the generated events. About 30% of the Geant-tracked events have a 3-prong decay.

The events analysed to estimate the background contamination of the signal were taken from the 1997 ATLAS jet production [3], simulated with the requirements:

\(\bullet\)\(p_{Thard-scattering}>17\) GeV;

\(\bullet\)\(|\)\(\eta_{hard-scattering~{}parton}\)\(|<2.7\).

The production of 942031 events was filtered to a _jet-candidate stream_, by applying a particle-level filter. The selection is a crude emulation of a LVL1 dijet trigger with a threshold set to 40 GeV and it is aimed at studies on multi-jet events and single hadronic jets. The jet candidates amounted to 19036 events, corresponding to 2.02% of the generated sample. We considered this last sample of events for our analysis.

## 3 Decay vertex and \(\tau\) momentum reconstruction

The events were reconstructed using the xKalman procedure driven by calorimeter jet seeds. In order to measure the lifetime, the decay length and the momentum of the \(\tau\) must be known.

For the measurement of the decay length, we reconstructed the secondary vertices originated from the \(\tau\) decay, using the ATLAS-adapted CDF vertexing algorithm CTVMFT. Candidate tracks belonging to a secondary vertex must be given to the algorithm, which then tries to fit them to a common vertex. Only tracks reconstructed within a small cone (\(\Delta R<0.1\)) around the jet axis were considered as candidate secondary vertex tracks. When at least two charged tracks, satisfying the Inner Detector quality cuts [4] and with \(p_{T}>1\) GeV were found, the reconstruction of a secondary vertex was attempted. In table 1 the efficiencies of all the described simulation and analysis steps are summarised. In the table there are also reported acceptances which will be discussed later-on.

In Fig. 1 the resolutions of the reconstructed \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) decay vertex coordinates are reported. As expected, a better resolution is obtained in measuring the transverse coordinates (\(x\), \(y\)) than the longitudinal one, therefore the lifetime measurement was performed in the transverse plane. The mean transverse path length of the generated \(\tau\)'s is \(\sim\) 2 mm.

To estimate the \(\tau\) momentum, two different methods were attempted. Both use as visible measured momentum the total momentum of the tracks reconstructed in the Inner Detector and belonging to the fitted decay vertex, and as visible energy (\(E_{vis}\)) the energy of these tracks calculated assigning the pion mass to all particles.

The first method closes kinematically the event by imposing the \(\tau\) mass to the decaying particle and a \(\nu\) as the missing particle balancing the transverse momentum relative to the line of flight of the decaying particle (\(p_{Tvis}\)). A second-degree equation in the momentum component of the \(\tau\) longitudinal to its line of flight is obtained. This method turned out to be poorly efficient: the \(p_{Tvis}\) to be balanced is very small and measured with large errors. Moreover only the charged particles, and in some cases not all of them, are fit to the vertex; as a consequence in some events the equation cannot be solved (negative discriminant). When the equation can be solved, two solutions are obtained and it is not always evident how to choose the correct one.

The second method uses an approximate estimator [5], [6], based on the fact that in the rest frame of the \(\tau\) particle the unseen momentum is emitted on average in a direction perpendicular to the \(\tau\) laboratory momentum. Assuming for each event the total visible momentum in the rest frame to be orthogonal to the line of flight of the \(\tau\), the Lorentz boost \(\gamma_{\tau}\) from the \(\tau\) rest frame to the laboratory frame is given by \(\gamma_{\tau}=\frac{E_{vis}}{\sqrt{M_{vis}^{2}+p_{Tvis}^{2}}}\), where \(M_{vis}\) is the invariant mass of the visible system. This approximation is working better for events with small \(p_{Tvis}\) as compared to \(M_{vis}\).

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline  & \(\#\;of\;Events\) & \(Acceptance\) \\ \hline Pythia Generation & 14000 & 1. \\ Geant Tracking & 1602 & \(11.5\times 10^{-2}\) \\ xKalman Reconstruction & 1595 & \(11.4\times 10^{-2}\) \\
3 prongs & 480 & \(3.4\times 10^{-2}\) \\ \(>1\) reconstructed track in the seed cone & 452 & \(3.2\times 10^{-2}\) \\ Secondary vertex reconstruction & 253 & \(1.8\times 10^{-2}\) \\ Quality cut on momentum estimator & 211 & \(1.5\times 10^{-2}\) \\ Trigger selection & 99 & \(7.1\times 10^{-3}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: _Signal acceptances._In Fig. 2 the resolution in measuring the transverse component of the \(\tau\) momentum is reported, and in Fig. 3 the same quantity is plotted as a function of the reconstructed value. This last plot can be fit by the superimposed function, which we used, event by event, to correct the estimator result. Such a correction method optimises the estimator result for the particular kinematics of the analysed event sample, which in our events has a transverse momentum peaked around 40 GeV. The correction method relies on a a good understanding of the momentum spectrum of the tau's. The method can be cross-checked by looking at \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\) events. If it proves unsuitable, then it need not be used, since the statistical sensitivity is dominated by tau lifetime itself, rather than the decay length resolution (provided the latter is smaller). Since the quality of the estimator gets lower for increasing values of the \(\frac{p_{Tvis}}{M_{vis}}\) ratio, introducing some systematic bias, this last quantity was cut at 2.5. This reduces the estimator acceptance from 100% to 83%.

The gain in the resolution of the measurement of the transverse component of the \(\tau\) momentum is evident (see Fig. 4).

## 4 Lifetime resolution

In Fig. 5 the resolution of the lifetime measurement is reported. The dashed distribution refers to a resolution estimated with the lifetime evaluated using the simulated momentum, i.e. only the errors in the vertex measurement contribute. The solid line represents the resolution of the lifetime evaluated using the \(\tau\) momentum as obtained from the described estimator. Its final \(\sigma\) value turns out to be 78 fs.

Trigger**

The hadronic \(\tau\) decay can be triggered in the calorimeter, asking for a collimated and isolated high-\(p_{T}\) jet and a high value of \(E_{Tmiss}\). Such a trigger is discussed in [7], where also the rejection against the QCD background jets is reported.

Since the simulated events did not undergo the trigger, we implemented a kind of software \(\tau\) trigger, studying some cuts in order to keep a good acceptance of the signal and at the same time a high rejection of the background.

The hadronic \(\tau\) jet is characterised by a high-\(p_{T}\) well-collimated calorimeter cluster with a small number of associated tracks. The calorimeter variables used to distinguish this topology are described in [8]. They can be summarised as:

\(\bullet\)\(p_{T}>30\) GeV. This requirement was applied to the signal at particle level before tracking. After the calorimeter reconstruction, accomplished without a complete calibration, we observed that the \(p_{Tcal}\) spectrum of the reconstructed \(\tau\)'s contained some events with smaller \(p_{Tcal}\), starting at 20 GeV. The background events were tracked with a softer cut (\(p_{Thard\ scattering}>17\) GeV), so we implemented on the reconstructed background jets the cut \(p_{Tcal}>20\) GeV;

\(\bullet\)\(R_{em}\), the jet radius computed using only the electromagnetic cells contained in the jet, which we cut at 0.1;

\(\bullet\)\(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\), the fraction of transverse energy in the EM and hadronic calorimeters, which is contained in a region defined by \(0.1<\Delta R<0.2\) around the barycentre of the cluster (isolation criteria). We cut at \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}<0.1\).

For what concerns the selection in \(E_{Tmiss}\)1, Fig. 6 shows the \(E_{Tmiss}\) distribution due to the \(\nu\)'s for the signal simulated events. The trigger discussed in [7] asks for \(E_{Tmiss}>30\) GeV, in order to keep the \(\tau\) trigger rate under control. To understand the sensitivity to the \(E_{Tmiss}\) threshold, we have considered a 20 GeV cut, but the final results are given for both 20 and 30 GeV.

Footnote 1: \(E_{Tmiss}\) has to be intended as evaluated for \(\mid\eta\mid<3\), i.e. in the physical region of Barrel plus End-Cap calorimeter acceptance. A dedicated analysis has been performed on samples of data fully simulated in the region \(\mid\eta\mid<5\), evaluating \(E_{Tmiss}\) in this extended physical region, which covers the Forward calorimeter acceptance, and keeping the requirement \(E_{Tmiss}>20\ GeV\). We have observed that the signal acceptance does not show any change, while the background acceptance is lower by a factor 2. We can conclude that our result is rather conservative.

The proposed trigger selection accepts 70% of the Geant tracked signal events, and about 4% of the background jet-candidate stream events.

A comparison with the trigger acceptances discussed in [7] shows that there is a good agreement. We also verified that this trigger does not introduce any bias on the resolutions reported above. The trigger acceptance on the events with a reconstructed secondary vertex is reported in table 1; the resolutions have been studied before applying the trigger to benefit from a larger statistics.

## 6 Background analysis

About \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the jet-candidate background events were analysed with the same chain as the signal events: after the reconstruction, secondary vertices were looked for, and the software \(\tau\) trigger was applied. In table 2 the acceptances of the analysed background at the main analysis steps are summarised.

An inspection on the 28 triggered background events does not show any physical significant feature: the triggered vertices are due to a casual spatial clustering of primary tracks not perfectly reconstructed. In Fig. 7 the lifetime of the triggered reconstructed

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline  & \(\#\ of\ Events\) & \(Acceptance\) \\ \hline Pythia Generation & 322931 & 1. \\ Geant Tracking & 46807 & \(14.5\times 10^{-2}\) \\ Jet-candidate selection & 6526 & \(2.02\times 10^{-2}\) \\ Triggered reconstructed secondary vertices & 28 & \(8.7\times 10^{-5}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: _Background acceptances._

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]

Considering the integrated luminosity \(3\times 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), which usually is assumed as 3 years of ATLAS low-luminosity running, a total of 1.5 millions of hadronic \(\tau\) decay events would be measured.

If, in order to keep the \(\tau\) trigger rate under control, an on-line selection at \(E_{T~{}miss}>30\) GeV is required, a total number of 780000 \(\tau\) events would be measured.

### Background

Within the analysed statistics we reduced the background to zero events. Using Poisson statistics, we can set an upper limit of 2.3 background events at 90% C.L., estimating a background acceptance \(<7.1\times 10^{-6}\). We could analyse the remaining 2/3 of the generated background sample: in the hypothesis to achieve the complete background rejection on the whole sample we have access to, the upper limit of the background acceptance is \(2.4\times 10^{-6}\); the eventual surviving of 1 or 2 background events would not change the terms of following consideration. The QCD jet cross-section at the LHC is estimated of the order of the mb, and many uncertainties (due _e.g._ to the structure functions and to the higher order corrections) prevent a sure evaluation. Let us assume a QCD jet cross section of 1 mb. We conclude that the accepted cross section of the background events has an upper limit of 2.4 nb, which is 50 times larger than the signal. The only way to better define this limit would be to fully simulate a sample of background events 2 orders of magnitude larger. A faster and simplified ATLFAST analysis could not help, since the validation of the candidate events requires to reconstruct the secondary vertices and to study its kinematics. The jet candidate stream, _i.e._ the background events we are analysing, represents 2% of the generated QCD jet events, and could be selected at particle level; moreover a \(p_{T}\) cut harder than 17 GeV could be applied before tracking. The Geant tracking of about 1M background events so selected would be useful in many different analyses and looks feasible in a medium-term future, when the first prototypes of ATLAS Regional Centres will start to work.

## 8 Sensitivity in \(\tau\) lifetime measurement

The ATLAS sensitivity in measuring the \(\tau\) lifetime has been obtained by a simple Monte Carlo: we have extracted the lifetimes of the number of \(\tau\) decays foreseen for the integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) according to an exponential distribution centred on 290 fs, and we have randomised each extracted value by the estimated resolution of 78 fs. From the maximum-likelihood analysis of these simulated sample of decays we get a lifetime resolution of 0.25 fs in case of triggering at \(E_{Tmiss}>20\) GeV and 0.35 fs for a trigger at \(E_{Tmiss}>30\) GeV. The obtained resolutions are very close to the limit values \(\frac{\tau_{\tau}}{\sqrt{N}}\), where \(\tau_{\tau}\) is the \(\tau\) lifetime and N is the number of measured events.

The reported result takes into account only the statistical error.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\(Background\)} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\(Signal\)} \\ \hline  & \(\#\,of\,\,Events\) & \(Acceptance\) & \(\#\,ofEvents\) & \(Acceptance\) \\ \hline Triggered reconstructed vertices & 28 & \(8.7\times 10^{-5}\) & 99 & \(7.1\times 10^{-3}\) \\ \(p_{Tcal}<70\) GeV & 12 & \(3.7\times 10^{-5}\) & 98 & \(7.0\times 10^{-3}\) \\ \(0.4<M_{hadronic}<1.78\) GeV & 7 & \(2.2\times 10^{-5}\) & 93 & \(6.6\times 10^{-3}\) \\ Positive signed impact parameter & 1 & \(3.1\times 10^{-6}\) & 77 & \(5.5\times 10^{-3}\) \\ Distance\({}_{prim-second~{}vtx}>0.1\) cm & 0 & – & 77 & \(5.5\times 10^{-3}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: _Quality cuts: background and signal acceptances_.

Concerning the systematics, we observe that the uncertainties on the acceptance are less important than the systematics on the momentum and lifetime measurement in the Inner Detector. The former could be cross-checked with the \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\) sample. The latter is very difficult to understand: the crucial point is the alignment understanding and our aim is to control it at O(1)\(\mu\)m in the transverse plane.

## 9 Conclusions

The described analysis indicates that it will be difficult to reject the QCD background down to the desired level, although a study with more statistics is needed to reach a firmer conclusion on this point. If it is possible to control the background, then an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) would allow a competitive result in measuring the \(\tau\) lifetime in ATLAS.
