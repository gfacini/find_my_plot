Evaluation of QCD uncertainties for Higgs boson production through gluon fusion and in association with two top quarks for simplified template cross-section measurements

The ATLAS Collaboration

This note summarizes the QCD uncertainties for Higgs boson production through gluon fusion and in association with two top quarks. The uncertainties are evaluated using a variation of the Stewart-Tackmann procedure in phase space regions defined by the stage 1.2 simplified template cross-section framework. They are used in the relevant ATLAS Run-2 Higgs boson measurements to assign uncertainties on the cross-section and acceptance predictions.

## 1 Introduction

The simplified template cross-section (STXS) framework has been designed to maximize the sensitivity of Higgs boson cross-section measurements to beyond-the-Standard-Model effects, while minimizing their theory dependence and allowing for the combination of analyses in different decay channels [1; 2]. In the STXS framework, cross-section measurements are performed in mutually exclusive phase space regions (also referred to as bins) specific to the different Higgs boson production modes.

This note provides a summary of the QCD uncertainties on the cross-section predictions in STXS stage 1.2 bins for Higgs boson production through gluon fusion (ggF) and in association with a \(t\bar{t}\) pair (\(t\bar{t}H\)) as shown in Figure 1. The STXS 1.2 splitting is based on the number of jets, the transverse momentum of the Higgs boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{H}\), the invariant mass of the two jets \(m_{jj}\), the transverse momentum of the system formed by the Higgs boson and the two highest-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Hjj}\), as well as the combined transverse momentum of the Higgs boson and the leading jet divided by the transverse momentum of the Higgs boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Hj}/p_{\mathrm{T}}^{H}\). For the STXS bin definitions, particle-level jets are built from stable particles (particles with lifetime \(c\tau>\)10 mm) including neutrinos, photons, and leptons from hadron decays or those produced in the parton shower. All Higgs boson decay products, as well as the leptons and neutrinos from the decays of the associated vectors bosons are excluded from the jet building, while the decay products from hadronically decaying associated vector bosons are included. The anti-\(k_{t}\) jet reconstruction algorithm [3; 4] with a radius parameter R = 0.4 is used. The jets are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV, with no restrictions on rapidity.

The described QCD uncertainties have been used in a number of ATLAS publications, in particular cross-section and couplings measurements, combining analyses in all accessible decay channels [5]. They are used for the Standard Model cross-section and acceptance predictions. The uncertainties on the cross sections of the other Higgs boson production modes (vector boson fusion and associated production with a vector boson) will be discussed elsewhere.

The reason a special procedure is needed to estimate the uncertainties in STXS bins due to unknown higher-order perturbative corrections instead of the usual variations of the renormalization (\(\mu_{\mathrm{r}}\)) and factorization (\(\mu_{\mathrm{f}}\)) scales is multifold. In some regions of phase space, the standard variations can lead to unrealistically small uncertainty estimates for fixed order calculations through cancellation effects, which

is described in the proposal of the Stewart-Tackmann (ST) procedure [6]. The standard procedure can also mismodel correlations of uncertainties between bins, since the higher-order effects approximated by the scale variations may include a number of different contributions.

The desired result is an uncertainty scheme that produces sensible results, both for the uncertainty values and their correlations.

A variation of the ST procedure is applied (the so-called long-range ST method), which includes a single uncertainty on the inclusive cross section, while the other components describe migration uncertainties in the fraction of events passing the selections defining the STXS regions. The goal is to have a full description of the cross-section uncertainty in each STXS region using a Hessian scheme, where the full uncertainty is split into components that are uncorrelated with respect to each other, while each is fully correlated across the STXS bins. Each uncertainty component can then be assigned an individual nuisance parameter in a profile likelihood fit.

The note is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the simulated samples used for the extraction of the uncertainties, Section 3 introduces the principles of the long-range ST procedure and Section 4 shows the extracted uncertainties for ggF and \(t\bar{t}H\) production cross sections.

## 2 Simulated event samples and theoretical calculations

Several simulated samples and theoretical calculations with varying approximations and different accuracy are used to evaluate and cross check the systematic uncertainties associated to the cross-section predictions in various STXS bins. A description of these samples and calculations are provided below and summarized in Table 1.

### ggF

Higgs boson production via ggF is simulated at NNLO accuracy in QCD using Powheg Box v2[7, 8, 9, 10, 11] (Powheg NNLOPS). The simulation achieves NNLO accuracy for arbitrary inclusive \(gg\to H\) observables by reweighting the Higgs boson rapidity spectrum in MiNLO HJ[12, 13, 14] to that of the HNNLO prediction [15]. Top- and bottom-quark mass effects are included up to next-to-leading order (NLO). The renormalization and factorization scales are set to half of the Higgs boson mass and the PDF4LHC15nnlo PDF set [16] is used. The matrix elements are matched to the parton shower of Pythia 8.2[17] which uses the AZNLO tune [18]. The decays of bottom and charm hadrons are performed by EvtGen 1.6.0[19].

The QCD scale uncertainties are obtained using 9-point scale variations of the NLO renormalization and factorization scales \(\mu_{\mathrm{r}}\) and \(\mu_{\mathrm{f}}\) by factors of 0.5 and 2, and applying the NNLO reweighting to those variations, including up and down variations of \(\mu_{\mathrm{r}}\) = \(\mu_{\mathrm{f}}\) by 0.5 and 2 around the central value for the NNLO part, yielding a total of 27 scale variations. Using these settings but without the reweighting, additional simulations are created with MiNLO HJ[12, 13, 14] and MiNLO HJJ[20] using the Powheg Box v2 generator. In addition to the Powheg samples, MG5_aMC@NLO simulations [21, 22] are used for uncertainty evaluations and cross-checks. The MG5_aMC@NLO samples are generated using PDF set NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118 [23] with infinite top-quark mass and zero bottom-quark mass.

Some sources of uncertainties are estimated with analytic calculations. The Boughezal-Liu-Petriello-Tackmann-Walsh (BLPTW) method [2, 24] utilizes resummed and fixed-order calculations and providescross sections in bins of jet multiplicity, as well as associated uncertainties. Other calculations including finite-top-quark mass effects at NLO ("SM_NLO") [25] are used for the evaluation of the \(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) migration in the high-\(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) region. Calculations at leading order (LO) with various top-quark mass settings [26, 27, 28, 29, 30] are used to estimate the uncertainty due to the choice of the top-quark mass scheme. These are listed as "Pole mass" in Table 1.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

### \(t\bar{t}H\)

The production of \(t\bar{t}H\) events is modelled using the Powheg Box v2 generator [9; 10; 11; 31; 32], which provides matrix elements at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}\) in the five-flavour scheme with the NNPDF3.0nlo PDF set [33]. The functional form of the renormalisation and factorisation scales is set to \(\sqrt[3]{m_{\mathrm{T}}(t)\cdot m_{\mathrm{T}}(\bar{t})\cdot m_{\mathrm{T}}(H)}\). The events are interfaced to Pythia 8.2[17] using the A14 tune [34] and the NNPDF2.3lo PDF set [33]. The decays of bottom and charm hadrons are performed by EvtGen 1.6.0[19].

Uncertainties due to missing higher-order corrections are evaluated through simultaneous variations of the renormalisation and factorisation scales by factors of 2 and 0.5 (using seven-point variations). For \(t\bar{t}H\), unlike ggF, no resummed calculations are available binned in the number of jets, so to capture parton shower/resummation effects, more QCD uncertainty sources are included in the calculation: Scale variations affecting initial and final state radiation (ISR and FSR) and parton shower variations. The uncertainty in the ISR is estimated from simultaneous variation of the renormalization and factorization scales and the Var3c up/down variations of the A14 tune. The uncertainties in FSR are estimated by varying the renormalization scale by a factor of 2 and 0.5.

## 3 QCD uncertainty parameterization

To avoid underestimates of the QCD uncertainties in exclusive phase space regions through artificial cancellations in the calculations, the Stewart Tackmann method suggests using QCD scale variations to determine uncertainties for inclusive cross sections, and use these to extract uncertainties for exclusive cross sections. As an example the uncertainty in the region with exactly one jet (\(N_{\mathrm{jet}}=1\)) can be estimated from the quadratic sum of the uncertainties in the regions \(N_{\mathrm{jet}}\geq 2\) and \(N_{\mathrm{jet}}\geq 1\).

The presented uncertainties are split into two types:

* **Yield uncertainties** which affect the overall normalization and, if they depend on any of the probed observables, also the shape.
* **Migration uncertainties** which affect the shape but not the normalization, and hence will have impacts that sum to 0 across all regions of phase

Each uncertainty component is uncorrelated from each other and can therefore be assigned to an independent nuisance parameter in the likelihood model of Higgs boson production cross-section measurements.

In many cases, theoretical calculations are available for the yield uncertainties. Otherwise, they are estimated with scale variations.

For the migration uncertainties, the long-range ST method us applied, similarly to what is proposed in Ref. [35]. Different from the original Stewart-Tackmann method, which assigns the selection effects only to the two adjacent jet bins separated by the selection cut, the migration uncertainties in the STXS framework are considered to propagate from the bin below a boundary to all bins above the boundary. For instance, a requirement on the dijet invariant mass \(m_{jj}\) = 700 GeV induces uncertainties caused by migration of events from the bin \(m_{jj}\) = [350,700] GeV to all bins above 700 GeV. This is captured in the uncertainty scheme by placing the relative uncertainty evaluated for \(m_{jj}\geq 700\) GeV on all individual bins falling into that region, and a relative uncertainty calculated from the same absolute uncertainty but opposite sign on the \(m_{jj}\) = [350,700] GeV bin. In addition, a scale factor \(\rho\) is applied to account for the double-countingeffects from multiple sources of migration uncertainties that are considered for a specific bin. For the ggF uncertainties, \(\rho=0.5\) allows the derived numbers to roughly match the largest scale uncertainties in each bin (the largest uncertainties are taken to avoid underestimation). For the \(t\bar{t}H\) uncertainties, \(\rho=0.7\) was found to be appropriate.

In the next two sections, the strategies and results for the uncertainty estimates of the ggF and \(t\bar{t}H\) production cross sections are discussed. For the ggF process, most migration uncertainties are estimated with the long-range ST method based on the (symmetrized) scale variation with the largest impact. As stated before, for \(t\bar{t}H\), unlike ggF, no resummed calculations are available in bins of jets, so to capture parton shower/resummation effects, scale variations affecting initial and final state radiation and parton-shower uncertainties are included as additional sources of QCD-related uncertainties. In the derivation of the \(t\bar{t}H\) uncertainties, events outside the nominal STXS Higgs boson rapidity selection \(|y|>2.5\) are included. They contribute 1.3% of the total yield.

The uncertainties presented in this note are applied to the state-of-the-art predictions (Powheg NNLOPS for ggF and Powheg NLO for \(t\bar{t}H\) as described in Table 1). The cross section values for each STXS bin, estimated by multiplying the production cross sections from Ref. [2] with the acceptances calculated from the samples listed above, are summarized in Appendix B. For reference, the cross sections for the STXS bins of the other production modes are listed in Appendix C.

## 4 Results

### ggF production mode

#### 4.1.1 ggF low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{H}\) (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{H}\) < 200 GeV) region

Yield uncertainties and jet migration:The renormalization, resummation, and migration uncertainties due to the split into bins of different jet multiplicities were calculated using the BLPTW method (see Section 2) and published in Table 20 in the Yellow Report 4 [2]. Since the publication of this report, N3LO calculations as well as EW corrections [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47] have become available, increasing the overall ggF cross section by 2.5%. The numbers from Table 20 in the Yellow Report 4 were converted into absolute uncertainties and scaled by a factor of 1.025 due to this cross section increase. The absolute uncertainties were then applied to the jet multiplicity distribution from NNLOPS, normalized to the best available total cross section. The shape of the NNLOPS distribution is compatible with the shape used in the Yellow Report within uncertainties. However, small differences in the central values lead to small changes in the resulting relative uncertainties. The uncertainties obtained from the procedure described above are shown in Table 2, where the symbol \(\lambda_{i}\) denotes the relative uncertainty induced by the source \(i\). The yield uncertainty is calculated separately for each bin and is split into a part due to scale variations \(\lambda_{\mu}\) and a resummation uncertainty \(\lambda_{res}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

\(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) bins in 1-jet and \(\geq\)2-jet regions:In the 1-jet and \(\geq\)2-jet regions, the uncertainty evaluation follows the long-range ST method. The scale variations considered include the renormalization scale \(\mu_{\rm r}\), factorization scale \(\mu_{\rm f}\), and the HNNLO scale. Figure 4 shows the \(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) spectrum for the scale variations that have significant effects. The \(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) uncertainties are estimated in the jet-inclusive region to avoid double-counting of the jet migration effects, and are covered by a single nuisance parameter in both the 1-jet and \(\geq\)2-jet regions.

For the \(\geq\)2-jet region, the \(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) bins are further split by \(m_{jj}\). Hence, the \(m_{jj}\) dependence on the \(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) uncertainties is investigated. To check the effect, the ratios of the largest variations over the nominal \(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) spectrum in each \(m_{jj}\) region are compared. As shown in Figure 5, the differences between the ratios in each \(m_{jj}\) region are within the statistical uncertainty (the ratios are smoother than the statistical bands because scale variations are implemented as internal reweighting, and because the numerator and denominator of the ratio use the same events but with a different weight and are therefore correlated, while the statistical uncertainties are propagated as if uncorrelated). Therefore, the \(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) uncertainties are treated as \(m_{jj}\) independent and it is safe to apply the long-range ST method in the \(m_{jj}\)-inclusive region for evaluation.

As in the 0-jet case, a smoothing procedure is applied on the resulting uncertainties to avoid discontinuities in the acceptance of event selections depending on \(p_{\rm T}^{H}\). The smoothing is performed by a linear interpolation

The form was also determined to ensure that the total migration effects cancel in the inclusive region. The original values of the \(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) uncertainties in 1-jet and \(\geq\)2-jet regions by the long-range ST method are shown in Table 4 and the smoothed ones are shown in Figure 6.

\(m_{jj}\) bins:The \(m_{jj}\) migration is evaluated by the long-range ST method in the 2-jet inclusive region. The variations considered are the renormalization scale \(\mu_{\rm r}\) and the factorization scale \(\mu_{\rm f}\). The \(H+0,1,2j\) MG5_aMC@NLO (FxFx) sample is chosen to estimate the uncertainties, with the scale variations across the \(m_{jj}\) spectrum shown in Figure 7. The evaluated uncertainties are shown in Table 5. The values were validated with the NNLOPS, \(H+2j\) MG5_aMC@NLO and MiNLO HJJ samples as described in Table 1.

#### 4.1.2 ggF high-\(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) (\(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) > 200 GeV) region

Due to effects of the resolved top-quark loop in the high-\(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) region, the extraction of the theoretical uncertainties, including the yield uncertainty, is separated from the low-\(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) region. Thanks to recent improvements of theoretical calculations at high-\(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) (see Section 2), the uncertainties in this region can now be more carefully evaluated.

Three types of uncertainties are considered in the high-\(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) region. The first and second type are the yield uncertainty and migration uncertainties caused by the splitting of the \(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) and \(p_{\rm T}^{Hj}/p_{\rm T}^{H}\) bins (QCD perturbative uncertainties). To cover the resolved top-quark-loop contribution, effects due to the **choice of the top mass scheme** are included, as well.

\(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) bins:The uncertainties are derived using the calculation of the \(H+1j\) cross-section at NLO accuracy with finite top mass (NLO_SM). The renormalization and factorization scales are considered in the derivation. The central value of the cross section and the scale variations are cross-checked with the NNLOPS and the MiNLO HJ amples 1. In addition, the envelopes of the scale variations are validated among the samples. The comparisons are shown in Figure 9(a) and 9(b) respectively. The yield uncertainty in the high-\(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) region and the \(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) migration are both evaluated using the long-range ST method, as shown in Table 8.

\(p_{\rm T}^{Hj}/p_{\rm T}^{H}\) bins:\(p_{\rm T}^{Hj}/p_{\rm T}^{H}\) is an observable used to probe the 1-jet exclusive and 2-jet inclusive events. Since the NLO_SM calculation is a function of \(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) only, the \(p_{\rm T}^{Hj}/p_{\rm T}^{H}\) migration is estimated using the NNLOPS sample and cross-checked with the \(H+0,1,2j\) MG5_AMC@NLO (FxFx) sample.

Before deriving the uncertainty, the \(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) dependence of the NNLOPS scale variations as a function of \(p_{\rm T}^{Hj}/p_{\rm T}^{H}\) was investigated. As shown in Figure 10, the envelope of the scale uncertainty over the \(p_{\rm T}^{Hj}/p_{\rm T}^{H}\) spectrum is consistent among all \(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) regions. Therefore, it is appropriate to evaluate the \(p_{\rm T}^{Hj}/p_{\rm T}^{H}\) migration using the long-range ST method in the \(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) inclusive region. The resulting uncertainties are shown in Table 9. Note that no \(\rho\) scale factor is applied in this case since there is only one boundary.

The bottom panel shows the ratio to the NLO_SM prediction. (b) Envelopes of scale variations divided by central value as a function of \(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) for the NLO_SM sample, compared to the NNLOPS and MiNLO HJ samples. The uncertainty envelope is created by symmetrizing the largest scale variation.

Top mass scheme uncertainty:For the NLO_SM calculation, the top mass is set to the pole mass, which is 173.05 GeV. To estimate the uncertainty due to the choice of the top mass scheme, another theoretical calculation at LO accuracy with various top mass settings is used. The top mass choices of the calculation include the pole mass and the \(\overline{MS}\) scheme with a dynamical scale \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\): \(m_{\mathrm{top}}(E_{\mathrm{T}})\), \(m_{\mathrm{top}}(2E_{\mathrm{T}})\), \(m_{\mathrm{top}}(E_{\mathrm{T}}/2)\).

The effect due to the top mass scheme across the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{H}\) bins is handled by a single nuisance parameter. The uncertainty is taken from the difference of the cross sections calculated with the pole mass and the \(\bar{MS}\) scheme. Since the cross sections are only at LO accuracy, the uncertainty is estimated to be half of the difference to account for the expected improvement with a NLO calculation. The resulting uncertainties are shown in Table 10.

### \(t\bar{t}H\) production mode

Yield uncertainties:The yield uncertainties are due to missing higher-order terms in the perturbative QCD calculations and are estimated to be 9.2% [48] by \(\mu_{\mathrm{f}}\) and \(\mu_{\mathrm{f}}\) scale variations.

\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{H}\) migration:The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{H}\) migration is evaluated with the long-range ST method. Renormalization, factorization scales variations, ISR (\(\mu_{R}\), \(\mu_{F}\) and shower variation Var3cDo), and FSR variations are taken into account in the evaluation. Figure 11 shows the effect of the simultaneous variation of the renormalization and factorization scales (top left), ISR (top right) and FSR (down) on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{H}\) spectrum. The values of the relative uncertainties on the cross sections binned in inclusive \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{H}\) regions are shown in

Since the maximal relative uncertainty is originating from the ISRdo(wn) variation (shown in Figure 13 along with the overall uncertainty of 9.2%), it is used to estimate the migration uncertainty with the long-range ST method. The migration across the \(p_{\rm T}^{H}=120\), 200, 300, 450 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) boundaries are evaluated with the standard long-range ST method, using \(\rho=0.7\).

(Note that the relative variations in the inclusive bin \(p_{\rm T}^{H}>0\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) correspond to the overall cross-section uncertainty of 9.2%.)

long-range ST method is applied in the opposite direction given that the bulk of the \(t\bar{t}H\) events is in the bin \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{H}\) =[60, 120] GeV and the standard procedure would overestimate the uncertainty in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{H}\) =[0, 60] GeV bin.

The corresponding migration uncertainties, as well as the total uncertainty in each \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{H}\) bin are shown in Figure 14 and presented in Table 11.

The effect of using an alternative NLO generator (MG5_aMC@NLO) or an alternative parton shower algorithm (Herwig) on the shape of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{H}\) spectrum was also checked and found to be negligible. It is therefore not used for the evaluation of the migration uncertainties.

## 5 Conclusion

The uncertainties on the cross-section predictions for ggF and \(t\bar{t}H\) were evaluated in bins of the simplified template cross-section framework, stage 1.2. To estimate the uncertainties in exclusive phase space regions, the long-range Stewart-Tackmann method was applied. These uncertainties are used in ATLAS Run-2 Higgs boson measurements, to assign uncertainties on the cross-section predictions and acceptance effects.
