**Expected Sensitivity in Light Charged Higgs Boson Searches for \(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu\) and \(H^{+}\to c\bar{s}\) with Early LHC Data at the ATLAS Experiment**

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

In many particle physics models beyond the Standard Model, the top quark can decay to a bottom quark and a light charged Higgs boson (\(m_{H^{+}}<m_{top}\)) in the reaction \(t\to bH^{+}\). In the Minimal Super-Symmetric Model (MSSM), the light charged Higgs boson decay \(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu\) can dominate other decays, depending on the parameter space, while \(H^{+}\to c\bar{s}\) can have a substantial branching ratio for low \(\tan\beta\). In the early data-taking period, the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) could either discover the light \(H^{+}\) or substantially improve the current Tevatron upper limits on \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\). We assume an integrated luminosity of 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) and \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV, and we evaluate expected upper limits for \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\), separately assuming \(\mathcal{B}(H^{+}\to c\bar{s})=1\) and \(\mathcal{B}(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu)=1\).

Introduction

One major task for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the ATLAS experiment is the exploration of the Higgs sector, in the Standard Model (SM) and beyond it [1]. The observation of scalar Higgs bosons is crucial in order to understand the electroweak symmetry breaking, as well as the mass generation of elementary particles, via the Higgs mechanism. In the SM, one doublet of scalar Higgs fields is needed to break the electroweak symmetry and, after absorption of three degrees of freedom by the electroweak gauge bosons, only one neutral scalar Higgs boson \(h^{0}\) is predicted.

However, several extensions of the SM require two isodoublets of scalar fields in the Higgs sector. In a generic Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), which the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM) assumes, there are five physical states. Two of them are charged (\(H^{+}\) and \(H^{-}\)) and, among the three neutral Higgs bosons, two are CP-even states, \(h^{0}\) and \(H^{0}\), and one is CP-odd, \(A^{0}\). The discovery of charged Higgs bosons would be a definite signal for new physics beyond the SM and it could even be the first experimental evidence for the MSSM. At tree level, the MSSM Higgs sector is determined by two independent parameters only, usually chosen for \(H^{+}\) studies to be the mass \(m_{H^{+}}\) and the ratio of the two Higgs doublet vacuum expectation values \(\tan\beta\). While radiative corrections may significantly modify the tree level values in the neutral MSSM Higgs sector, they have a more limited effect in the charged Higgs sector. In the MSSM, a light \(H^{+}\) decays primarily to \(c\bar{s}\), \(b\bar{b}W^{+}\) and \(\tau^{+}\nu\)1, depending on \(\tan\beta\) and \(m_{H^{+}}\)[2]. For \(\tan\beta<1\), \(c\bar{s}\) and \(b\bar{b}W^{+}\) dominate with \(\mathcal{B}(H^{+}\to c\bar{s})\) near 40% for \(m_{H^{+}}\simeq 130\) GeV. For \(\tan\beta>1\), \(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu\) dominates the other decays and for \(\tan\beta>3\), \(\mathcal{B}(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu)\) exceeds 90%.

Footnote 1: Charge conjugate states are implied throughout this note.

The combined LEP lower limit for charged Higgs bosons in any type-II 2HDM is about 80 GeV [3, 4, 5, 6] and does not depend on the branching ratios of the charged Higgs boson. In the MSSM, it can be indirectly strengthened to about 130 GeV by the experimental constraints on the mass \(m_{A}\) and the fact that \(m_{H^{+}}^{2}=m_{A}^{2}+m_{W}^{2}\). At the Tevatron, the searches for MSSM Higgs bosons in \(p\bar{p}\) collisions complement those performed at LEP, since they cover regions of the MSSM parameter space with either a small (below 1.5) or large (above 30) \(\tan\beta\), but no evidence for charged Higgs bosons has been found. As a result, limits were put on the branching ratio \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) by the Tevatron experiments for the light \(H^{+}\) (\(m_{H^{+}}<m_{top}\)), see Figure 1.

Figure 1: The 95% confidence level upper limits on the branching ratio \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) versus \(m_{H^{+}}\), assuming \(\mathcal{B}(H^{+}\to c\bar{s})=1\) (left, CDF) and \(\mathcal{B}(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu)=1\) (right, D0) for the charged Higgs boson. The CDF study [7] used a 2.2 fb\({}^{-1}\) dataset while the D0 study [8] used a 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) dataset.

Table 1 summarizes the limits on the branching ratio \({\cal B}(t\to bH^{+})\) from CDF and D0 for the four charged Higgs boson masses considered in this note, i.e. 90, 110, 130 and 150 GeV. Note that, for \(m_{H^{+}}=90\) GeV, the strongest limit on the leptophobic charged Higgs boson comes from D0 [8] rather than CDF.

Since none of the masses in the 2HDM Higgs sector is predicted by theory, one needs to make assumptions on the charged Higgs boson mass before deciding on search strategies. A detailed study aimed at determining the ATLAS discovery and exclusion sensitivity for a broad range of \(m_{H^{+}}\) values from 90 GeV to 600 GeV was reported in [9] for the hadronic \(\tau\) decay channel \(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}_{had}\nu\) is semileptonic and all hadronic \(t\bar{t}\) events, as well as for the leptonic \(\tau\) decay channel \(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}_{lep}\nu\) in semileptonic \(t\bar{t}\) events. That study also considered the heavy charged Higgs boson with \(H^{+}\to t\bar{b}\) and \(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}_{had}\nu\). In this note, we focus on two other channels not considered in [9]: \(H^{+}\to c\bar{s}\) in semileptonic \(t\bar{t}\) events and \(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}_{lep}\nu\) in dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) events.

If the charged Higgs boson is light enough (\(m_{H^{+}}<m_{top}\)), it can appear in the decay of an on-shell top quark. At the LHC, \(t\bar{t}\) pairs will be copiously produced, via the \(gg\) or \(q\bar{q}\) fusion process. In this note, we assume the \(t\bar{t}\) cross section at \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV to be \(\sigma_{t\bar{t}}=401.6\) pb [10]. Note that other processes may also contribute to the production of charged Higgs bosons, e.g. single top production, but they are not considered here. We consider four charged Higgs boson masses: 90, 110, 130 and 150 GeV. Because we assume the branching ratios to \(c\bar{s}\) or \(\tau^{+}\nu\) to be unity, \(\tan\beta\) does not play a role in this study.

We start this study by discussing the signal processes and their SM backgrounds, in Section 2. Then, in Section 3, we present the search strategy and expected results in the search for \(H^{+}\to c\bar{s}\) in semileptonic \(t\bar{t}\) events with an integrated luminosity of 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) assuming \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV. In Section 4, we introduce two new tools for the dilepton search (the helicity angle \(\cos\theta^{*}\) and the generalized transverse mass \(m_{T2}^{H^{+}}\)) and we present the search strategy and expected results for \(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu\to l\nu\bar{\nu}\nu\) in dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) events with an integrated luminosity of 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) and \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV. Finally, we summarize our results and conclude in Section 5.

## 2 Signals and Backgrounds

### Monte Carlo Simulation of \(t\bar{t}\to H^{+}W^{-}\) Signals

In order to study the signal with ATLAS full simulation, MC samples of \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}H^{+}W^{-}\) events were produced (together with their charge conjugates) with either \(H^{+}\to c\bar{s}\) or \(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu\to l^{+}\nu\bar{\nu}\nu\). This was performed in two stages. A first batch of MC samples was generated, where \(W\) only decays to electrons and muons directly. Additional samples for \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}H^{+}W^{-}\) with a \(W\to\tau+\nu\) decay were then produced. The signal cross sections, computed using the Tevatron upper limits for \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) are summarized in Table 2. Note that \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}H^{+}H^{-}\) events were not produced. However, we do not expect our results to be significantly affected by their absence: their branching ratio, assuming the Tevatron upper limits on \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\), is one order of magnitude smaller than for \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}H^{+}W^{-}\).

### Monte Carlo Simulation of SM backgrounds

The main background for \(H^{+}\to c\bar{s}\) and \(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu\) is the production of SM semileptonic and dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) events, respectively. Two generators were used to simulate such events: MC@NLO and AcerMC. The cross section for not fully hadronic \(t\bar{t}\) events is 218.4 pb.

Single top processes are the next major source of background in both studies. At the LHC, single top quark production is possible via three mechanisms [11]: \(s\)-channel production arising from the exchange of an off-shell \(W\) boson (\(\sigma_{s}=6.6\) pb), \(t\)-channel exchange of a virtual \(W\) boson (\(\sigma_{t}=124.5\) pb), and associated production of a top quark and a \(W\) boson (\(\sigma_{Wt}=32.7\) pb). For the \(s\)- and \(t\)-channels, only one \(W\) boson is produced (coming from the top quark decay) so there is usually only one charged lepton \(l=e,\,\mu\) in the final state. On the other hand, in the \(Wt\)-channel, two \(W\) bosons are produced and, as a result, some dilepton single top events may lead to final states which are very similar to dilepton decays of \(t\bar{t}\) pairs. Note that the production of light charged Higgs bosons via the single top processes is not considered in the following of this study.

The SM processes involving electroweak gauge bosons which decay leptonically (\(\ell=e,\,\mu,\,\tau\)) have also been considered:

* for \(W\to\ell\nu\) + 0-5 partons: \(\sigma=48.3\) nb,
* for \(Z\to\ell\ell\) + 0-5 partons: \(\sigma=4.5\) nb,
* for \(W(\ell\nu)+b\bar{b}\) + 0-3 partons: \(\sigma=17.9\) pb (the corresponding MC samples were generated using phase space cuts so that they can be used in addition to the \(W\) + 0-5 partons samples with only a minor overlap),
* for \(Z(\ell\ell)+b\bar{b}\) + 0-2 partons: \(\sigma=57.0\) pb (a cut at 30 GeV was applied on the dilepton invariant mass at the generator level).

Although QCD processes do not have the same signature as our signal, they may contribute to the background as a result of their huge cross section and a small rate of lepton misidentification. Due to the large computer resources that would be required for an accurate full simulation study of the QCD background, it is not included in our study and will instead have to be estimated on data itself. Still, simulations performed on the available QCD background samples suggest that it remains negligible, after full signal selection.

Search for \(H^{+}\to c\bar{s}\) in Semileptonic \(t\bar{t}\) Events

This analysis considers a potential non-SM decay of \(t\bar{t}\) pairs, in which one of the top quarks decays as \(t\to bH^{+}\), with the charged Higgs boson subsequently decaying to two jets. At low \(\tan\beta\), this is a viable decay scenario for a light charged Higgs boson.

### First stage selection

Similarly to the study of semi-leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) events reported in [12], we apply the following kinematic cuts:

1. Exactly one electron with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) OR exactly one muon with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\),
2. Missing transverse energy \(E_{T}^{miss}>20\) GeV,
3. At least four jets with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) (a cone algorithm with radius 0.4 is used),
4. Two of the four leading jets are \(b\)-tagged (with a \(b\)-tagging weight IP3D\(+\)SV1 [13] larger then 4.2).

When more than four jets fulfill the \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) requirements of cut 3, then the four jets with the highest \(p_{T}\) are assumed to be those coming directly from the \(t\bar{t}\) pair decay. Note that, since we want to accurately reconstruct a dijet mass, a precise measurement of the energy is important, which explains why we only select hadronic objects in the central region.

### Dijet Mass Distribution and Dijet Mass Filter

Since we select events with two \(b\)-tagged jets, we can assign the two untagged leading jets to the dijet system from \(H^{+}\) or \(W\) decays. The resulting dijet mass distributions for \(H^{+}\) and \(W\) are shown in the left-hand side plot of Figure 2. Their large width presents a problem to separate a small \(H^{+}\) signal from the SM \(t\bar{t}\) background, since the signal peak will lie close to that of the background. For this reason, we use a fitting technique to reduce the widths and tails of the dijet mass distributions.

The dijet system from the decay \(H^{+}\to c\bar{s}\) can be directly reconstructed. However, more information can be gained by reconstructing the entire \(t\bar{t}\) event. This requires the correct assignment of the jets from the top quark decays to the four original partons. Only the four leading jets described in Section 3.1 are considered in this assignment. With this method, it is also possible to include events with zero or one \(b\)-tagged events in the future. Since the two jets of the dijet system originate from the same charged boson, these jets are indistinguishable in terms of jet assignment. This leaves two possible jet configurations for the event as a whole. If 1 (0) of the jets have \(b\)-tags, this number is increased to 6 (12).

The reconstruction of the leptonically decaying \(W\) boson requires the knowledge of the neutrino momentum. The transverse momentum of the neutrino, \(p_{T}(\nu)\), is inferred from \(E_{T}^{miss}\). Then, the mass of the leptonically decaying \(W\) boson is constrained to be 80.4 GeV, allowing the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino, \(p_{L}(\nu)\), to be expressed in terms of two measurable quantities: \(p_{T}(\nu)\) and the lepton momentum \(p_{l}\). The resulting quadratic equation in \(p_{L}(\nu)\) provides two solutions for each permutation of jet assignment. This gives 4 (12, 24) possible combinations for events with 2 (1, 0) \(b\)-tagged jets.

For each combination, jet energies were scaled using a pre-defined light jet correction, which takes into account the dependence of the measured jet energy on the \(\eta\) region of the detector. An additional top-specific correction was applied to transfer, on average, the measured jet energy to a partonic level energy. This \(p_{T}\)-dependent scaling function was derived from MC@NLO \(t\bar{t}\) events as follows. The selection cuts described in Section 3.1 were applied, and events were selected where all four leading jets were matched to the truth partons within \(\Delta\)R \(<\) 0.2. The true parton \(p_{T}\) was then compared with the reconstructed jet \(p_{T}\), and a transfer function was derived as a function of the jet \(p_{T}\). This method additionally provides an estimate of the jet \(p_{T}\) resolution \(\sigma_{jet}\) as a function of \(p_{T}\).

The dijet mass fitter was then applied, the motivation for which is two-fold: it selects the combination of jets for which it is most likely that the jet assignment is correct (in events with two \(b\)-tagged jets, this is trivial) and it leads to an improved resolution of the dijet mass distribution.

Let \(\sigma_{W}\) and \(\sigma_{top}\) be the widths of the \(W\) boson and the top quark, respectively. The unclustered energy \(UE\) is defined as a quantity absorbing all jet \(E_{T}\) not associated with the primary lepton or the four leading jets, and is used to correct \(E_{T}^{miss}\). In the fitting process, MINUIT was used to minimize the following \(\chi^{2}\) function:

\[\chi^{2} = \sum_{i=l,4\,jets}\frac{(p_{T}^{i,fit}-p_{T}^{i,meas})^{2}}{ \sigma_{i}^{2}}\] \[+ \sum_{j=x,y}\frac{(p_{j}^{UE,fit}-p_{j}^{UE,meas})^{2}}{\sigma_{ UE}^{2}}\] \[+ \sum_{k=jib,bl\nu}\frac{(M_{k}-M_{top})^{2}}{\sigma_{top}^{2}}\] \[+ \frac{(M_{l\nu}-M_{W})^{2}}{\sigma_{W}^{2}}.\]

In the fitting process, the \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) of final state particles are fixed, while the measured momenta are permitted to vary within their experimental resolutions. It is this re-scaling of measured values that facilitates the improvement of the dijet mass resolution. The jet resolution \(\sigma_{jet}\) has been estimated as a function of \(p_{T}\) during the derivation of the top-specific correction, while the \(UE\) resolution is estimated to be \(0.4\sqrt{UE}\). In practice, the contribution to the total \(\chi^{2}\) from the lepton and \(UE\) terms is small in comparison to that from the four leading jets. In each event, only the combination with the lowest \(\chi^{2}\) value is used to extract the dijet mass. We require the lowest \(\chi^{2}\) value to be less than 10, and the reconstructed top mass in the hadronic channel (before jet energy rescaling) to be less than 195 GeV. If the best combination does not pass these cuts, the event is rejected. The resulting dijet mass distributions, shown in the right-hand side plot of Figure 2, are used as templates to fit the signal and backgrounds.

Figure 2: At left, the dijet mass templates (normalized to a unit area) for the reconstructed \(H^{+}\) and \(W\) bosons. At right, the dijet mass templates (normalized to a unit area) for \(H^{+}\) and \(W\) after fitting. In the fitted distributions, a cut was made on the \(\chi^{2}\) of the dijet mass fitter at 10 and we require the reconstructed top mass on the hadronic side to be smaller than 195 GeV.

This analysis is essentially a shape comparison and, as such, it will be sensitive to the jet energy scale (JES) which will alter the shape of the dijet mass distribution. To reduce this effect, we use a simple calibration method. Since the majority of the events are expected to be SM \(t\bar{t}\) pairs, we use the template distribution for these events to calibrate the dijet mass distribution. This technique is described in more detail in Section 3.4 and will largely correct for systematic bias caused by the JES. However, any relative bias in the JES between light quark jets and \(b\)-jets will not be accounted for, since the calibration is derived solely from the \(W\) mass. This effect is evaluated as an additional systematic. In the future, this relative bias can also be reduced by calibrating the \(b\)-jet energy scale using the measured top quark mass.

### Acceptances and Results

Table 3 shows the event flow at different stages of the analysis cuts. The estimated numbers of events are for 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) of data, with \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})=10\%\). Neither \(Z\)+jets nor \(Zbb\)+jets backgrounds survive the overall selection cuts. Note that the signal acceptance of the double \(b\)-tag decreases as the \(H^{+}\) mass approaches the top mass, since the lower energy \(b\)-jet is more difficult to tag.

Using the Tevatron upper limits for the branching ratio \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\), the expected experimental sensitivity is calculated for each \(H^{+}\) mass point according to \(\mathcal{S}=N_{\text{sig}}/\sqrt{N_{\text{bg}}}\), where \(N_{\text{sig}}\) and \(N_{\text{bg}}\) are the number of signal and background events under the \(H^{+}\) dijet mass peak after having applied all selection criteria (a \(\pm 3\sigma\) mass window is considered). The expected sensitivity, for each \(H^{+}\) mass point, is summarized in Table 4.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(H^{+}\) mass in GeV & 90 & 110 & 130 & 150 \\ \hline \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) & 22\% & 15\% & 8\% & 13\% \\ \hline \(\mathcal{S}=N_{\text{sig}}/\sqrt{N_{\text{bg}}}\) & 5.9 & 4.9 & 3.3 & 4.0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\end{table}
Table 3: Cut flow table for the charged Higgs boson signal with \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})=10\%\), and for the main SM backgrounds. The integrated luminosity is 200 pb\({}^{-1}\).

Assuming no signal beyond the SM, we use a binned maximum likelihood method to find the upper limit on the branching ratio \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) at 95% confidence level (CL), assuming \(\mathcal{B}(H^{+}\to c\bar{s})=1\). For each bin \(i\), let \(n_{i}\) be the observed number of events. The likelihood function \(LH\) is then defined as:

\[LH=\prod\frac{\nu_{i}^{n_{i}}\times e^{-\nu_{i}}}{n_{i}!}\bigotimes G (N_{bkg},\sigma_{N_{bkg}}), \tag{2}\] \[\text{where }\nu_{i} =N_{\bar{t}\bar{t}}\times 2\mathcal{B}(t\to H^{+}b)[1- \mathcal{B}(t\to H^{+}b)]\times A_{H^{+}}\times P_{i}^{H^{+}}\times\mathcal{B} (W\to\ell\nu)\] \[+N_{\bar{t}\bar{t}}\times[1-\mathcal{B}(t\to H^{+}b)]^{2}\times A_{W }\times P_{i}^{W}\times\mathcal{B}(W\to\ell\nu)[2-\mathcal{B}(W\to\ell\nu)]+N _{bkg}\times P_{i}^{bkg}.\]

Here, \(A_{H^{+}}\) and \(A_{W}\) are the acceptances for \(H^{+}\)- and \(W\)-mediated events, as derived from Table 3, while the prior probability \(P_{i}\) to find events in bin \(i\) is taken from the simulated dijet mass distributions of \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}H^{+}W^{-}\), \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}W^{+}W^{-}\) and non-\(t\bar{t}\) background events shown in Section 3.2.

The three fit parameters are the branching ratio \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\), the total number of \(t\bar{t}\) events \(N_{\bar{t}\bar{t}}\) and the number of non-\(t\bar{t}\) background events \(N_{bkg}\). However, non-\(t\bar{t}\) background events are independently estimated using SM Monte Carlo samples, with a predicted value \(N_{bkg}=30\pm 9\). Thus, \(N_{bkg}\) has a Gaussian constraint with its uncertainty in the likelihood function. MINUIT is used to minimise the negative log-likelihood based on Equation (2) and the performance of the likelihood fit is tested using 1000 simulated pseudo-experiments (PE). Each PE is generated using bin-by-bin Poisson fluctuations of the template dijet mass distribution, using a null-Higgs hypothesis. Thus, the fit result for \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) is expected to be zero.

The upper limit on \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) at 95% CL is extracted using the likelihood shape as a function of \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\). \(LH\) is computed over the range \(0\leq\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\leq 1\) by fixing \(N_{\bar{t}\bar{t}}\) and \(N_{bkg}\) to the fit results, and manually varying the branching ratio between 0 and 1. The projection onto the x-axis where the integration reaches 95% of the total positive area indicates the upper limit on \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) at 95% CL. The calculation of the upper limit is based on the Bayes' theorem assuming a flat prior probability. Figure 3 shows a PE likelihood value as a function of the branching ratio, as well as the integral of this function. This process is repeated for each PE, with the mean value of the 95% CL upper limit on the branching ratio over all PEs taken as the null-Higgs expectation for the upper limit at 95% CL.

Figure 3: Example likelihood shape normalized to have a maximum at 1 (solid line) and likelihood integral (dotted line) as a function of positive \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) for one PE. In both cases the maximum value is normalised to one. The arrow shows the position of the 95% CL upper limit from this particular PE.

### Systematic Uncertainties

There are many sources of systematic uncertainty in the extracted upper limit on \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) at 95% CL. These include the uncertainties on the jet energy scale (JES), the jet energy resolution (JER), the amount of initial and final state radiation (ISR and FSR) and the choice of Monte Carlo (MC) generator used in the event generation. These systematic uncertainties have two effects. Firstly they change the selection acceptances for \(H^{+}\) and \(W\) events, and secondly they perturb the shape of the dijet mass distribution. Note that the result of the upper limit on \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) is almost free from luminosity uncertainties. Any acceptance bias affects both signal and backgrounds at the same level. This also applies to uncertainties on the predicted \(t\bar{t}\) cross section as well as on trigger and reconstruction efficiencies. The effect of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency is also small if the \(H^{+}\) mass is close to the \(W\) mass.

The systematic uncertainty is estimated as the change in the upper limit on \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) due to a \(\pm 1\sigma\) change in each source of systematic error. For each source, the perturbed dijet mass distribution is simulated using MC samples. 1000 pseudo-experiments are generated from the perturbed distribution, and the shift in the output branching ratio is extracted by comparing the upper limit at 95% CL with that from the nominal samples. The full list of systematics, and the choices of \(\pm 1\sigma\) are shown in Table 5. In addition, the uncertainty due to the choice of MC generator is evaluated by comparing the results using the MC@NLO and AcerMC generators. Finally, \(t\bar{t}\) samples were used to check the acceptance change when the Pythia ISR/FSR showering was varied, the same factor being then applied to rescale the signal acceptance.

The effect of each systematic uncertainty on the acceptance for each channel was studied. The change in acceptance that is due to the JES uncertainty is initially quite large. This effect is minimised using a JES calibration based on the unfitted dijet mass distribution from SM \(t\bar{t}\) background events. The peak position of the dijet mass distribution after the effect of the JES has been simulated is compared to the peak value of the nominal sample using a Gaussian fit over a \(2\sigma\) range. The ratio of these two peak positions is used as a re-scaling factor. For all systematic samples whose jet energy scale is not consistent with that of the nominal sample, we apply this re-scaling factor to all jets and we re-obtain the acceptances and dijet mass distributions using these re-calibrated jet energies. These acceptances are found to be close to the value obtained for the nominal sample. We find that both the JES systematic samples and the ISR/FSR systematic samples need to be recalibrated. The variation of the 95% CL upper limit for \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) caused by each systematic is shown in Table 6. After the JES recalibration, the analysis is largely insensitive to the JES.

The expected 95% CL upper limit on \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) when all systematics are included is based on a Gaussian smearing of the likelihood function:

\[LH^{\prime}(x^{\prime})=\int_{0}^{1}LH(x)\times\frac{1}{\Delta(x^{\prime}) \sqrt{2\pi}}\ exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{x^{\prime}-x}{\Delta(x^{\prime })}\right]^{2}\right)dx. \tag{3}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Systematic & Definition \(\pm 1\sigma\) \\ \hline Jet Energy Resolution (\(|\eta|<3.2\)) & \(0.45*\sqrt{E}\) \\ Jet Energy Resolution (\(|\eta|>3.2\)) & \(0.63*\sqrt{E}\) \\ Jet Energy Scale (\(|\eta|<3.2\)) & \(\pm 7\%\) \\ Jet Energy Scale (\(|\eta|>3.2\)) & \(\pm 15\%\) \\ \(b\)-jet Energy Scale & \(b\)-tagged jet energy \(\pm 3\%\) \\ Lepton Energy Scale & \(\pm 1\%\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Chosen definitions of \(\pm 1\sigma\) for each systematic uncertainty.

In Equation (3), both \(x\) and \(x^{\prime}\) represent \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\). \(LH(x)\) is the likelihood function with no systematic smearing, an example of which is shown in Figure 3. The smeared likelihood function \(LH^{\prime}(x^{\prime})\) is calculated from the convolution of \(LH(x)\) with a Gaussian whose width describes the combination in quadrature of all systematic uncertainties. Basically, in the Bayesian approach, the total systematic uncertainty on \(\Delta\mathcal{B}\) is represented in the \(LH\) by a nuisance parameter which adds to the branching ratio, and has a Gaussian prior probability density function (PDF) with width \(\Delta\mathcal{B}\). We eliminate this nuisance parameter by Bayesian marginalization [14] and obtain a posterior PDF in \(\mathcal{B}\), assuming a uniform prior PDF in \(0\leq\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\leq 1\). The effect on the likelihood shape due to the total systematic uncertainty is shown in Figure 4 for a particular PE. This procedure is repeated for each PE, and the expected 95% CL upper limits on \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) are recalculated using the smeared likelihood function. Figure 4 also shows the 95% CL upper limit from each PE, and the resulting \(1\sigma\) and \(2\sigma\) bands around the mean value.

The expected limits for \(H^{+}\) masses of 90 to 150 GeV are shown in Table 7. The expected limits in the second row are based on the statistical errors only, but the expected limits in the third row are based on both statistical and systematic errors. The expected limit is considerably higher as the \(H^{+}\) mass approaches the \(W\) mass, because it becomes more difficult to separate the signal from the background distribution. These results are also summarized in Figure 13, along with the current Tevatron limits.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Systematic & \(\Delta\mathcal{B}\) \\ \hline Jet Energy Resolution & 0.71\% \\ Jet Energy Scale & 0.07\% \\ MC Generator & 0.56\% \\ ISR/FSR & 0.54\% \\ \(b\)-jet Energy Scale & 0.75\% \\ Lepton Energy Scale & 0.08\% \\ Combination in quadrature & 1.26\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Pile-up Effects

The limits calculated in Section 3.4 do not take into account the effect of pile-up. Assuming that during early data-taking the LHC reaches luminosities of the order \(10^{32}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), such effects cannot be assumed to be negligible. Following [15], we estimate the systematic uncertainty due to pile-up effects with an instantaneous luminosity of \(10^{32}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and a bunch spacing of 450 ns. The cavern safety factor (i.e. the simulated rate divided by the expected rate of Compton electrons and spallation protons in the muon system, due to the permanent neutron-photon bath in the ATLAS cavern) is set to 2.

This scenario brings an average of four additional interactions per event. As expected, the 4 jet cut efficiency is increased dramatically, due to the extra energy added to each jet. The additional jet energy is also seen to shift the template distributions to higher mass. Such a shift can have a large effect on the extracted upper limit on \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\), since the nominal shape of the di-jet mass distribution is used in the likelihood fit. We derive a correction to the jet energies using information about the number of additional reconstructed vertices in each event. Figure 5 shows the di-jet mass in the event, as a function of the number of additional vertices. A linear parameterisation was used to derive a jet energy correction, and 920 MeV per additional vertex was subtracted from the jet energies.

Using the method described in Section 3.4, the size of the systematic error due to pile-up after the jet energy recalibration was estimated to be 0.090 for a 90 GeV \(H^{+}\) and 0.004 for a 130 GeV \(H^{+}\). These numbers can be compared with Table 6. The recalibration using the number of reconstructed vertices in each event is found to improve the shape of the di-jet mass distribution significantly, and the acceptance changes for the signal and background events are quite similar. The systematic due to the pile-up is less than 1% in \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) when the signal \(H^{+}\) mass is far away from the \(W\) mass. However, the effect is not negligible (9 %) when the signal \(H^{+}\) mass is close to the \(W\) mass. The expected upper limits

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c c c c|} \hline \(m_{H^{+}}\) (GeV) & 90 & 110 & 130 & 150 \\ \hline Expected upper limit \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) (stat. only) & 5.8\% & 3.9\% & 3.4\% & 2.3\% \\ Expected upper limit \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) (stat + syst) & 17.8\% & 5.5\% & 4.4\% & 4.3\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

including pile-up are shown for a 90 GeV and 130 GeV \(H^{+}\) in Table 8. Since the size of the pile-up highly depends on the beam condition, and we do not have the samples required to estimate the size of the systematic over the full mass range, we decide not to include this systematic in the final quoted limits.

In summary, the effect of the presence of pile-up on the expected upper limits of \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) varies between 3% and \(<0.3\%\) as the signal mass increases from 90 GeV to 130 GeV.

## 4 Search for \(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu\to l^{+}\nu\bar{\nu}\nu\) in Dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) Events

Although dilepton decays of \(t\bar{t}\) pairs have a smaller branching ratio than the other decay channels, the presence of two charged leptons and two \(b\)-jets in the final state is a clean signature, which should be both easier to trigger on and cleaner than other \(t\bar{t}\) events with a higher jet multiplicity. On the other hand, the presence of undetectable neutrinos in the decay of both top quarks makes the reconstruction of their invariant mass impossible.

If the charged Higgs boson solely decays into \(\tau^{+}\nu\), then a small increase of the branching ratio for dilepton decays of \(t\bar{t}\) pairs occurs, because \(\tau\) decays leptonically more often than the \(W\) boson: indeed, \({\cal B}(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu\to l^{+}\nu\bar{\nu}\nu)\simeq 35\%\) while \({\cal B}(W\to l\nu)\simeq 25\%\). As a result, if \({\cal B}(t\to H^{+}b)\) is 17% (the D0 upper limit when \(m_{H^{+}}=130\) GeV), the branching ratio of dilepton decays of \(t\bar{t}\) pairs goes up by 14%. In the early stage of the LHC data taking, this increase is likely to be of the same order as the relative uncertainties coming from the integrated luminosity, the cross section, the trigger and reconstruction efficiencies. Search strategies for the charged Higgs boson in early LHC data can therefore not only rely on the presence or absence of an absolute excess of dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) events, as compared to the SM predictions, but instead require the identification of discriminative variables that allow distinction between leptons produced in \(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu\to l^{+}\nu\bar{\nu}\nu\) and leptons arising from \(W\) boson decays.

We present a search for charged Higgs bosons in dilepton decays of \(t\bar{t}\) pairs with full simulation of the ATLAS detector, based on the use of new tools: the helicity angle \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) and the generalized transverse mass \(m_{T2}^{H^{+}}\). The experimental sensitivity is estimated for an early data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 200 pb\({}^{-1}\).

### Helicity Angle \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\)

In the SM top quark decays (i.e. those mediated by a \(W\) boson with purely V-A couplings), a fraction \(m_{t}^{2}/(m_{t}^{2}+2m_{W}^{2})\simeq 0.69\) of the \(W\) bosons is expected to be found with a longitudinal polarization. The remainder, i.e. a fraction \(2m_{W}^{2}/(m_{t}^{2}+2m_{W}^{2})\simeq 0.31\) of the \(W\) bosons, is expected to have a left-handed helicity in the top quark rest frame. With \(\theta_{\ell}^{*}\) defined as the angle of the lepton momentum with respect to the helicity axis, in the \(W\) rest frame, this leads to the following normalized angular distribution for the charged lepton \(\ell=e\), \(\mu\), \(\tau\) arising from \(W\to\ell\nu_{\ell}\):

\[\frac{1}{N}\frac{dN(W\to\ell\nu_{\ell})}{d\cos\theta_{\ell}^{*}}=\frac{3}{4} \times\frac{m_{t}^{2}(1-\cos^{2}\theta_{\ell}^{*})+m_{W}^{2}(1-\cos\theta_{ \ell}^{*})^{2}}{m_{t}^{2}+2m_{W}^{2}}. \tag{4}\]

In the rest frame of the decaying top quark, the recoiling \(b\) quark has its momentum anti-parallel to the momentum of the \(W\) boson. For the sake of simplicity, we now neglect the mass of the \(b\) quark and we assume that the decay is mediated by an on-shell \(W\) boson. Let \(p_{b}\) and \(p_{\ell}\) be the 4-momenta of the \(b\) quark and the charged lepton \(\ell\), respectively. With our assumptions, \(\cos\theta_{\ell}^{*}\) can be expressed as [16]:

\[\cos\theta_{\ell}^{*}\simeq\frac{4\,p_{b}\cdot p_{\ell}}{m_{t}^{2}-m_{W}^{2}}-1, \tag{5}\]

Note that \(p_{b}\) and \(p_{\ell}\) can be advantageously chosen in the laboratory frame, since \(\cos\theta_{\ell}^{*}\) contains an invariant product. Also, no knowledge about the momentum of the neutrino accompanying the charged lepton is required to compute \(\cos\theta_{\ell}^{*}\). In the case of \(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu\), the decay products are distributed isotropically because the charged Higgs boson has a spin 0. Unfortunately, an experimental angular analysis of dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) events exclusively aimed at establishing the spin 0 of a presumptive charged Higgs boson in the top quark decays is very challenging, for two reasons. First, the kinematic assumptions that lead to Equation (5) are not valid as soon as \(m_{H^{+}}\) differs from \(m_{W}\). More importantly, the presence of two neutrinos in the leptonic \(\tau\) decays does not allow full reconstruction of its momentum.

Still, the presence of a charged Higgs boson in top quark decays does affect the angular distribution \(\cos\theta_{t}^{*}\), where \(l\) now denotes a final state electron or muon only. If a top quark decay is mediated through \(H^{+}\) instead of \(W\), the \(b\) quark usually receives a smaller momentum (provided that \(H^{+}\) is heavier than \(W\)). In addition, when \(l\) arises from a \(\tau\) decay, it is likely to have a smaller momentum than when coming directly from a \(W\) boson. As a result, the presence of a charged Higgs boson strongly reduces the invariant product \(p_{b}\cdot p_{l}\) in Equation (5) and hence leads to values of \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) mostly close to -1. Dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) with \(W^{+}W^{-}\), \(H^{+}W^{-}\) or \(H^{+}H^{-}\) in the intermediate state were produced using MadGraph/MadEvent [17]. Tauola [18] was used for the \(\tau\) decays. The samples were then weighted according to \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) and combined. Figure 6 shows the resulting \(\cos\theta_{t}^{*}\) distributions, as obtained in the SM case or assuming the presence of a 130 GeV charged Higgs boson in the top quark decays with \(\mathcal{B}(t\to H^{+}b)=17\%\).

### Generalized Transverse Mass \(m_{T2}^{H^{+}}\)

Another useful kinematic variable for the search of charged Higgs bosons in dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) events is \(m_{T2}^{H^{+}}\), i.e. the so-called _generalized transverse mass_ that provides an event-by-event upper bound on \(m_{H^{+}}\)[19]. The method by which such a variable is obtained for a general event topology is rather simple: one maximizes (or minimizes, depending on the nature of the constraints) an unknown particle mass in the event, subjected to the constraints which are imposed by the known particle masses and by momentum conservation in the transverse plane.

We consider \(t\bar{t}\to H^{+}bW^{-}\bar{b}\), with subsequent decays \(W^{-}\to\ell^{-}\bar{\nu}_{\ell}\) and \(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu\to l^{+}\nu\bar{\nu}\nu\). We assume that the top quarks and the \(W\) boson are on-shell, and that the missing transverse momentum in the event comes entirely from neutrinos produced in the decays of the charged Higgs and \(W\) bosons.

Figure 6: At left, the normalized \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) distributions of final state electrons and muons in dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) events, coming from \(W\to l\nu_{l}\) (dotted line), \(W\to\tau^{+}\nu\to l^{+}\nu\bar{\nu}\nu\) (dashed line) and \(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu\to l^{+}\nu\bar{\nu}\nu\) (full line). Note that only the normalized \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) distribution associated to \(W\to l\nu_{l}\) follows Equation (4). At right, generator-level \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) distribution of the final state electrons and muons in dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) events, assuming a correct assignment of the various decay products, in the SM (dashed line) and with a 130 GeV charged Higgs boson in the top quark decays with \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})=17\%\) (full line).

The following constraints are obtained for the particles in \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}W^{-}H^{+}\to b\bar{b}(\ell^{-}\bar{\nu}_{\ell})(l^{+}\nu\bar{ \nu}\nu)\):

\[(p^{H^{+}}+p^{b})^{2} = m_{top}^{2},\] \[(p^{\ell^{-}}+p^{\bar{\nu}_{\ell}})^{2} = m_{W}^{2},\] \[(p^{\ell^{-}}+p^{\bar{\nu}_{\ell}}+p^{\bar{\nu}_{\ell}})^{2} = m_{top}^{2}, \tag{6}\] \[(p^{\bar{\nu}_{\ell}})^{2} = 0,\] \[\vec{p}_{T}^{\,H^{+}}-\vec{p}_{T}^{\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}}+\vec{p}_{T }^{\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}} = \vec{p}_{T}^{\,miss}.\]

In these equations, we have chosen \(p^{H^{+}}\) and \(p^{\bar{\nu}_{\ell}}\) to represent the unknown quantities in the event, while all other 4-momenta are known. Hence, there are 8 unknown variables and only 6 constraints, meaning that the system is under-constrained with two degrees of freedom. We now define \(m_{T2}^{H^{+}}\) as the maximum of the invariant mass \((p^{H^{+}})^{2}\) subjected to the constraints of Equation (6):

\[(m_{T2}^{H^{+}})^{2}=\max_{\{Eq.~{}(\ref{eq:m_T2})\}}[(p^{H^{+}})^{2}]. \tag{7}\]

By choosing the \(z\)-component of the \(H^{+}\) momentum as one of the unconstrained degrees of freedom, half of the maximization can be performed analytically using the result obtained for the transverse mass of a charged Higgs boson in semi-leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) decays, see [20] for details. Doing this, we obtain:

\[m_{T2}^{H^{+}}=\max_{\vec{p}_{T}^{\,H^{+}}}[M_{T}^{H}(\vec{p}_{T}^{\,H^{+}})], \tag{8}\]

where

\[(M_{T}^{H})^{2}=\left(\sqrt{m_{top}^{2}+(\vec{p}_{T}^{\,H^{+}}+\vec{p}_{T}^{\, b})^{2}}-p_{T}^{\,b}\right)^{2}-(p_{T}^{H^{+}})^{2}. \tag{9}\]

Since \(\vec{p}_{T}^{\,H^{+}}\) is constrained by Equation (6), there is effectively one remaining degree of freedom. The rest of the maximization has to be done numerically. A program that computes the generalized transverse mass for dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) events was written. Its input parameters are the two components of the missing transverse momentum, as well as the 4-momenta of the two leptons and of the two \(b\) quarks. Exactly as when computing the \(\cos\theta_{t}^{\,+}\) distribution of the final state electrons and muons, we assume a correct assignment of the various decay products, i.e. a \(b\) quark and a charged lepton \(l\) always form a correct \((lb)\) pair. However, since the correct association between the two \((lb)\) pairs and the two bosons is presumably unknown, the computation of the generalized transverse mass must be performed twice and the output histograms must later be superimposed (if the assignment of the \(b\) quarks and the charged leptons is fully unknown, the computation must be performed four times). By construction, the generalized transverse mass satisfies \(m_{T2}^{H^{+}}\geq m_{H^{+}}\), where \(m_{H^{+}}\) is the true charged Higgs boson mass. It is this property that provides the potential for the generalized transverse mass \(m_{T2}^{H^{+}}\) to discriminate between charged Higgs and \(W\) bosons.

The left-hand side plot of Figure 7 shows the generalized transverse mass, as computed for two types of events: \(t\bar{t}\to bW^{+}\bar{b}W^{-}\to bl^{+}\nu_{l}+\bar{b}l^{-}\bar{\nu}_{l}\) and \(t\bar{t}\to bW^{+}\bar{b}H^{-}\to bl^{+}\nu_{l}+\bar{b}\tau^{-}\bar{\nu}_{\tau}\) (together with their charge conjugates), where \(\tau\) further decays into a charged lepton \(l\). One clearly observes a lower edge at \(m_{H^{+}}\) for the \(t\bar{t}\) events with a charged Higgs boson in the intermediate state, as expected. Taking into account all intermediate states for \(t\bar{t}\) decays, the right-hand side plot of Figure 7 shows the generalized transverse mass, in the SM or assuming the presence of a 130 GeV charged Higgs boson in the top quark decays with \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})=17\%\). In this case, one finds a shoulder at \(m_{H^{+}}\) in the generalized transverse mass distribution.

### Event Selection

The general selection of dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) candidate events first relies on the positive decision of a single electron or muon trigger with a \(p_{T}\) threshold of 15 GeV. We then require the presence of two oppositely charged leptons (electron or muon) with \(p_{T}>10\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\), also demanding at least one lepton with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV. The remaining events must then have at least two jets with \(p_{T}>15\) GeV and \(|\eta|<5\). The two jets with the highest likelihood of being \(b\)-jets are assumed to be daughters of the top and anti-top quarks. Note that these selection cuts are slightly different from those reported in a recent study of the (SM) dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) cross section measurement in ATLAS [15]. Indeed, we have relaxed the \(p_{T}\) cut on the sub-leading charged lepton, since a too hard cut would remove a large fraction of the events near -1 in the angular distribution \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\). Also, the \(p_{T}\) cut on the two jets is more relaxed in order to account for the fact that a \(b\) quark is likely to have less transverse momentum if the decay of its (mother) top quark is mediated by a charged Higgs boson, which is heavier than a \(W\) boson.

Note that there is a four-fold ambiguity in assigning the leptons and the \(b\)-jets to their parents. It is important to make this assignment correctly, as \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) values for incorrectly paired background events tend towards the signal region. In a first stage, we determine the correct \(l\)-\(b\) pairing by selecting only those events which have an easy-to-find incorrect pairing. These are identified as having either \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}>1\) or no solution for \(m_{T2}^{H^{+}}\) for either of the two \(l\)-\(b\) pairs. For such events with a clear incorrect pairing, the other solution gives the correct \(l\)-\(b\) combinations and the particles of the pair with the smallest \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) are assumed to originate from the \(t\to bH^{+}\) decay (the "\(H^{+}\) side"). For events that have \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}<1\) for all pairings, we assign the pair with the largest \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) value (out of all four possible ones) to the \(t\to bW\) decay (the "\(W\) side") and its partner pair to the \(t\to bH^{+}\) decay, defined as the "\(H^{+}\) side".

For background events with no charged Higgs mediated decays, the method of pairing the leptons and jets causes a bias towards smaller \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) values. However, since no fit to the SM expected shape is performed, this bias does not cause difficulties for the rest of the analysis. More importantly, the ability to assign the \(l\)-\(b\) pairs correctly for signal events potentially improves the ability to set the charged Higgs mass limit through the computation of the generalized transverse mass.

### Background Normalization

Although the cross sections for background processes can be estimated in theory, we cannot rely on them due to the possible presence of both theoretical uncertainties and new physics. Furthermore, the trigger sensitivities to various backgrounds may have high uncertainties in the early running, and one can not trust MC simulations alone to predict all instrumental effects and the backgrounds coming from distribution tails. Therefore, when data becomes available, we will have to scale the number of MC events in order to match the data, for various background types individually. The normalization factors are determined by isolating each background type to a unique sideband that is not sensitive to other processes and by finding the ratio of event numbers between MC samples and data. Table 9 summarizes the sidebands that are chosen (followed by event selection cuts) to isolate the signal and the dominant SM backgrounds. The variables used for the sideband isolation are the \(b\)-weight, \(E_{T}^{miss}\), the flavor and the invariant mass \(m_{ll}\) of the two leptons, as well as \(\cos\theta_{t}^{*}\) (only the \(H^{+}\) side is used when a cut is applied).

This procedure was tested using a sample of simulated "pseudo-data", known as the TopMixing sample. It was originally created for top physics studies and contains a mixture of different SM processes contributing to final states with real leptons, including \(t\overline{t}\), single top, \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons with and without additional jets (including heavy flavour jets) and diboson events. The production of fake and non-isolated leptons from QCD multi-jet events was not included. In order to exercise data-driven analysis and background normalization procedures, the events were ordered randomly, the Monte Carlo truth information was removed and the cross-sections of the different processes were scaled by up to about \(\pm 20\%\) from the central value of the SM expectations. These scale factors were not revealed to those using the TopMixing sample. When performing the background normalization, we use SM cross-sections as the starting point, and we determine the normalization factors as follows:

1. Events with a \(Z\) boson are selected first. In their sideband, the comparison between the number of events under the \(Z\) peak for the TopMixing and MC samples leads to a normalization factor of \(1.19\pm 0.06\) (the uncertainty reported here is purely statistical).
2. A pure \(t\overline{t}\) sample is then selected by requiring \(b\)-tagged jets, \(E_{T}^{miss}>50\) GeV, and \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}>-0.4\) on the \(H^{+}\) side to ensure that the selected top quarks decay only via a \(W\) boson. In this sideband, a comparison between the number of events coming from the TopMixing and MC samples leads to a normalization factor of \(0.87\pm 0.07\) for \(t\overline{t}\).
3. Events with a \(W\) boson are then selected. For this purpose, processes with a \(Z\) boson or at least one top quark are vetoed, e.g. by choosing \(e\mu\) combinations and light jets. Some \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Z\to\tau\tau\) events with \(e\mu\nu\bar{\nu}\nu\bar{\nu}\) final states survive this selection, however the normalization factor for those processes was derived prior to the analysis of the \(W\) sideband. A small amount of single top events are also found in the \(W\) sideband, for which we use the SM cross section normalized in the same way as the \(t\overline{t}\) events, since those are not easily isolated. We compute a normalization factor of \(1.11\pm 0.15\) for the \(W\to\ell\nu+\)jets samples.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c||c|} \hline Process & \(Z\)+jets & \(W\)+jets & Single top & SM \(t\overline{t}\) & \(H^{+}W\to 2\) leptons \\ \hline \hline \(b\)-weight cut & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\(<0\)} & \multicolumn{2}{c||}{\(>4.3\)} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\(>4.3\)} \\ \hline \(E_{T}^{miss}\) cut & \(<30\) GeV & \(>30\) GeV & \(<50\) GeV & \(>50\) GeV & \(>50\) GeV \\ \hline Leptons & \(ee\) or \(\mu\mu\) & \(e\mu\) & no cut & no cut \\ \hline \(m_{ll}\) cut & \(86\to 96\) GeV & \multicolumn{2}{c||}{no cut} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{no cut} \\ \hline \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) (\(H^{+}\) side) & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{no cut} & \multicolumn{2}{c||}{\(>-0.4\)} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\(<-0.6\)} \\ \hline \end{tabular}

At this stage of the analysis, i.e. after having renormalized the MC samples to the data, one will have to check the agreement between the MC samples of the SM processes and data, for various kinematic variables. In particular, the MC \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) distributions (on both the \(H^{+}\) and \(W\) sides) must agree with data in the sideband of e.g. \(Z+\) jets events, whether or not new physics is present in \(t\bar{t}\) events. The same must be true for the generalized transverse mass distribution. Figure 8 shows the \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) and generalized transverse mass distributions in the \(Z\) sideband: the filled histograms show the prediction from the (scaled) MC samples, while the black dots show the distribution obtained with the TopMixing sample. Having added dilepton \(t\bar{t}\to H^{+}W\) events with \(m_{H^{+}}=130\) GeV and \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})=17\%\) to the TopMixing sample, one obtains exactly the same distributions. As expected, the presence of a charged Higgs boson does not affect the \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) and generalized transverse mass distributions in the \(Z\) sideband.

A similar comparison is performed in the \(t\bar{t}\) sideband, however with no cut on \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\). Again, one obtains a good agreement for the \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) and generalized transverse mass distributions, see Figure 9.

### Data-driven Estimation of the Lepton Misidentification Rate

A large portion of the non-\(t\bar{t}\) background comes from lepton misidentification. For example, \(W\to l\nu\) events have only one true charged lepton, but the additional jets have a small chance of being misidentified as leptons. Although the probability of two such "fake" leptons is assumed negligible, sometimes a real lepton from a \(c\) or \(b\) quark may survive lepton selection criteria. Such events may be present in QCD background, but are difficult to quantify due to the insufficient MC statistics available. Thus, in this analysis, we are interested in determining directly from data what fraction of the selected leptons are fake leptons. In the case of an observed excess in fake-lepton count, possibly due to the unmodeled QCD contribution, we are able to achieve further QCD suppression by applying a higher \(E_{T}^{miss}\) cut until the agreement between MC and data is obtained. For the purpose of evaluating the fake-lepton count, we define two lepton selection criteria, loose and tight.

Figure 8: Comparison of the \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) and generalized transverse mass distributions, as obtained from the scaled MC samples and the TopMixing sample in the \(Z\) sideband (the \(Wbb\) and \(Zbb\) backgrounds are shown by the darker shaded histograms). Dilepton \(t\bar{t}\to H^{+}W\) events were later added to the TopMixing sample, however this sideband is not sensitive to the signal.

The fractions of real and fake leptons satisfying the tight selection criteria can be measured in some appropriate sidebands: the real lepton fraction, \(r\), is measured from leptons in the \(Z\) sideband and the fake lepton fraction, \(f\), is measured from the \(W\) sideband. The fractions \(r\) and \(f\) of real and fake leptons are defined as follows:

\[r=\frac{N_{\rm tight,real}}{N_{\rm tight,real}+N_{\rm loose,real}}\ {\rm and}\,f= \frac{N_{\rm tight,fake}}{N_{\rm tight,fake}+N_{\rm loose,fake}}. \tag{10}\]

Here, the sum of \(N_{\rm tight}\) and \(N_{\rm loose}\) may not be the total number of leptons in the sample. The values of \(N_{\rm tight}\) and \(N_{\rm loose}\) are measured measured using a "tag & probe" approach. That is, for each event with a tight lepton ("tag"), we count how often the other lepton ("probe") satisfies the tight and loose criteria, respectively. Using the two fractions, \(r\) and \(f\), we can express the number of real and fake leptons in terms of the number of leptons passing the tight and loose selection:

\[\left[\begin{array}{c}N_{\rm tight}\\ N_{\rm loose}\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}rr&rf\\ r(1-r)&r(1-f)\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}N_{\rm real}\\ N_{\rm fake}\end{array}\right]. \tag{11}\]

Inverting the matrix, we can compute the number of events with fake leptons, \(N_{\rm RF}\):

\[N_{\rm fakes}=N_{\rm RF}=\frac{N_{\rm TL}+\frac{r-1}{r}N_{\rm TT}}{r-f}. \tag{12}\]

Thus, after measuring \(N_{TT}\) and \(N_{TL}\) from data, we can determine if the MC fake lepton background expectation is accurate. The number of tight and loose leptons in the TopMixing sample were found to be \(139\pm 12\) and \(8\pm 3\) respectively, yielding \(N_{\rm fakes}=34\pm 12\) using Equation (12). Meanwhile, the sum of \(W/Z+{\rm jets}\) and single-top MC background, normalized to the TopMixing sample, gives an expectation of \(N_{\rm fakes}^{MC}=28\pm 5\), consistent with the data-driven estimate.

Figure 9: Comparison of the \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) and generalized transverse mass distributions, as obtained from the scaled MC samples (with no \(t\bar{t}\to H^{+}W\) event) and the TopMixing sample in the \(t\bar{t}\) sideband, however with no cut on \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\).

### Sensitivity Estimation

We apply the following selection cuts in order to isolate the dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) events with (presumably) a charged Higgs boson:

* two oppositely charged leptons (electron or muon) with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV (leading) and \(p_{T}>10\) GeV (sub-leading), and at least two jets with \(p_{T}>15\) GeV,
* \(b\)-weight greater than 4.3 (as in the \(H^{+}\to c\bar{s}\) study, we use the IP3D+SV1 \(b\)-tagger),
* \(E_{T}^{miss}>50\) GeV,
* \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}<-0.6\) (\(H^{+}\) side).

Table 10 shows the effect of these cuts on all processes that are considered in this study, assuming an integrated luminosity of 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) and \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})=10\%\) for all signal processes. In addition, we use the SM cross sections for all background processes, without any renormalization.

Figure 10 shows the \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) distributions (on both the \(H^{+}\) and \(W\) sides) in the SM case (dashed line) or with \(m_{H^{+}}=130\) GeV and \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})=17\%\). A significant excess of events in the bin closest to -1 in the \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) distributions of the \(H^{+}\) side can show evidence for the presence of a charged Higgs boson in the top quark decays, however it gives only little information on \(m_{H^{+}}\).

The expected experimental sensitivity was calculated separately for each \(H^{+}\) mass point, assuming the latest Tevatron upper limits, see Table 11.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Process & \multicolumn{6}{c|}{Number of events after} \\  & no cut & \(2l+2j\) & \(b\)-tagging & \(E_{T}^{miss}\) & \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) & Trigger \\ \hline \hline Signal \(m_{H^{+}}=90\) GeV & 1286 & 378 & 300 & 211 & 151 & 141 \\ Signal \(m_{H^{+}}=110\) GeV & 1286 & 416 & 330 & 233 & 173 & 165 \\ Signal \(m_{H^{+}}=130\) GeV & 1286 & 405 & 308 & 221 & 173 & 163 \\ Signal \(m_{H^{+}}=150\) GeV & 1286 & 380 & 269 & 199 & 152 & 142 \\ \hline SM \(t\bar{t}\) not hadronic & 43673 & 2958 & 2174 & 1287 & 602 & 597 \\ Single top \(Wt\)-channel & 2853 & 116 & 71 & 44 & 28 & 27 \\ Single top \(t\)-channel & 8635 & 128 & 66 & 29 & 19 & 18 \\ Single top \(s\)-channel & 303 & 5 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline \(Z\to\ell\ell\) + jets & 883570 & 4592 & 506 & 7 & 4 & 4 \\ \(W\to\ell\nu\) + jets & 9693973 & 824 & 64 & 26 & 22 & 17 \\ \(Wbb\) + jets & 3580 & 28 & 16 & 6 & 5 & 5 \\ \(Zbb\) + jets & 11485 & 833 & 540 & 8 & 5 & 5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 10: Cut flow table for the charged Higgs boson signal with \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})=10\%\), and for the main SM backgrounds. The integrated luminosity is 200 pb\({}^{-1}\).

Figure 11 shows how the generalized transverse mass distributions are affected by the presence of a charged Higgs boson, again with \(m_{H^{+}}=130\) GeV and \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})=17\%\). While the generalized transverse mass distribution may provide additional insight on \(m_{H^{+}}\) if a signal is observed, we refrain from placing a cut on it _a priori_.

The branching ratio upper limits are evaluated in the case of non-observation of signal according to:

\[\mathcal{B}=\frac{N_{\text{obs}}-N_{\text{bg}}}{2\times\sigma_{\bar{t}t}\times L _{int}\times\epsilon_{\text{sig}}}. \tag{13}\]

where \(N_{\text{obs}}\) is the number of observed events surviving the selection criteria, with an expectation value \(N_{\text{bg}}\) for the background.

We evaluate \(\mathcal{B}\) for 10000 toy MC experiments, varying the input parameters by their uncertainties. A probability weight for each \(\mathcal{B}\) is determined by:

\[W_{\mathcal{B}}(N_{\text{bg}},N_{\text{obs}},\epsilon_{\text{sig}})=P(N_{ \text{bg}})\times P(N_{\text{obs}})\times P(\epsilon_{\text{sig}}). \tag{14}\]

Figure 11: Comparison of the generalized transverse mass distributions in the SM case (dashed line) and as obtained when assuming \(m_{H^{+}}=130\) GeV together with \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})=17\%\) (filled histogram). All selection cuts are applied, except the one on \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\).

Here, \(P(x)\) are modeled by Gaussian probability density functions. The width of the \(N_{\rm obs}\) distribution is the Poisson uncertainty \(\sqrt{N_{\rm obs}}\), while the widths of \(N_{\rm bg}\) and \(\epsilon_{\rm sig}\) are determined by the MC statistics and systematic uncertainties. The branching ratios \(\mathcal{B}\) are evaluated with and without the systematic uncertainties, resulting in distributions similar to the one shown in Figure 12. The 95% confidence level upper limit is determined by solving for \(\mathcal{B}^{95\%}\) in:

\[0.95=\int_{0}^{\mathcal{B}^{95\%}}\mathcal{B}d\mathcal{B}. \tag{15}\]

In the case of signal non-observation (\(N_{obs}-N_{bg}=0\)) we expect to be able to compute the upper limit for \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\). The precise values are dependent on the charged Higgs boson mass, and are listed in Table 12.

### Systematic Uncertainties

The estimated background (\(N_{bg}\)) and the signal efficiency (\(\epsilon_{sig}\)) may be affected by both assumptions at the theoretical level and the performance of the detector. The associated systematic uncertainties must be calculated and included in our sensitivity estimation for finding new physics, as well as in the computation of the signal branching ratio upper limit. The contributing sources of systematic uncertainties are listed in Table 13. Since the background MC samples are normalized to data, many of the efficiency uncertainties actually do not affect the expected number of background events.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Mass & Signal & Expected upper limit on \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) \\ (GeV) & Efficiency & without systematics & with systematics \\ \hline
90 & 11.0\% & 8.3\% & 10.4\% \\
110 & 12.8\% & 7.1\% & 8.9\% \\
130 & 12.7\% & 7.1\% & 8.9\% \\
150 & 11.1\% & 8.0\% & 10.3\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure 12: Determination of the branching ratio upper limit with (dashed line) and without (solid line) systematic uncertainties, for a 130 GeV charged Higgs boson.

Whenever possible, we use data driven methods to normalize the MC background contributions to the levels observed in data. By doing so, we are not sensitive to the uncertainty on the integrated luminosity, and we reduce the effect of the uncertainty on the cross sections for the signal and background processes, which are model-dependent and may also vary with the center of mass energy. The uncertainties in the normalization are driven by the available statistics in both the data and the MC samples, and they are of the order of 7%. Furthermore, although the data driven MC normalization works for many of the backgrounds, we must rely on the relative theoretical cross sections between some background processes (e.g. \(t\bar{t}\) and single top). The theoretical uncertainty on the single top cross section is 3-8% [21] resulting in an additional uncertainty below 1% for the total number of background events.

The uncertainty in the trigger and reconstruction efficiencies for leptons are both assumed to be 1%, as estimated in [22] for 100 pb\({}^{-1}\) at 14 TeV.

The energy scale uncertainty is 1% for leptons. The largest uncertainty when estimating the number of jets faking electrons comes from defining the control sidebands. In order to quantify this uncertainty, we calculate the real and fake lepton selection efficiencies (\(r\) and \(f\)) after varying the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) cut, and conservatively take twice the largest variations as our systematic uncertainty.

The jet energy scale uncertainty is 7% for \(|\eta|<3.2\), and 15% for \(|\eta|>3.2\). In addition to the \(p_{T}\) requirements, the energy scale has an effect on the \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) selection efficiency, which depends on the assumed mass of the charged Higgs boson.

We have varied both lepton and jet energies within their uncertainties. The largest resulting variations in \(N_{bg}\) and \(\epsilon_{sig}\) are taken as their respective systematic uncertainties.

The missing transverse energy is affected by the lepton and jet energy scale measurements described above. Since we normalize the dominant \(t\bar{t}\) process only after having applied the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) cut, we expect any other effect due to \(E_{T}^{miss}\) mis-modeling to be negligible.

Using the \(b\)-tagger at the default operating point (with an efficiency \(\epsilon_{b}=60\%\)), the uncertainty in the efficiency is estimated to be 4%. The fake rejection rate affects mainly the \(Z/W+\)jets and QCD backgrounds, for which we assign an additional uncertainty of 10% on the number of background events.

The dominant \(t\bar{t}\) process is studied with both AcerMC and MC@NLO samples. We observe only minor differences in the distribution shapes, consistent with statistical fluctuations, and we refrain from considering additional systematic uncertainties.

Finally, note that we do not consider systematic uncertainties coming from ISR/FSR, because the dilepton channel has no cut on the jet multiplicity (other than requiring at least two jets). Additional jets in the event should not have a large effect on selecting \(t\bar{t}\) events, especially since we pick the jets with the highest \(b\)-weights.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c||c|c|} \hline Source & Uncertainty & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Effect (in \%) on} \\  & (in \%) & \(N_{bg}\) & \(\epsilon_{sig}\) \\ \hline \hline Normalization & 7 & 7 & n/a \\ Trigger & 1 & \(<1\) & 1 \\ Lepton ID efficiency & 1 & \(<1\) & 1 \\ Lepton fake rate & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ Lepton energy scale & 1 & \(<1\) & 1 \\ Jet energy scale & 7-15 & 7 & 4 \\ \(b\)-tagging efficiency & 4 & \(<1\) & 4 \\ \(b\)-tagging fake rate & 10 & 1 & \(<1\) \\ \hline Total & & 10 & 6 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Pile-up Studies

As for the \(H^{+}\to c\bar{s}\) study, the effect of pile-up was studied with the following parameters:

* Luminosity \(=10^{32}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\),
* Bunch spacing \(=450\) ns,
* Cavern safety factor \(=2\).

Table 14 shows how the cut flow is affected by pile-up for two mass points (90 and 130 GeV). A comparison with Table 10 suggests a slight increase of the signal efficiency, however the event counts after each cut remain consistent with those obtained without pile-up, within statistical uncertainties. We thus conclude that pile-up does not significantly affect our results. The same conclusion was drawn in the study of the (SM) dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) cross section measurement in ATLAS [15].

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Process & \multicolumn{6}{|c|}{Number of events after} \\  & no cut & \(2l+2j\) & \(b\)-tagging & \(E_{T}^{miss}\) & \(\cos\theta_{t}^{*}\) & Trigger \\ \hline \hline Signal \(m_{H^{+}}=90\) GeV & 1286 & 395 & 310 & 219 & 154 & 147 \\ Signal \(m_{H^{+}}=130\) GeV & 1286 & 430 & 321 & 232 & 178 & 170 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 14: Cut flow table for two charged Higgs boson signal samples with \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})=10\%\). Here, pile-up was added to the signal events.

Summary and Conclusion

We have described two searches for a light charged Higgs boson in ATLAS, using the early LHC data (i.e. with \(\int dt\mathcal{L}=200\) pb\({}^{-1}\) and \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV), after having reviewed the current upper limits on the branching ratio \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) established by the Tevatron experiments. The two channels considered in this study are \(H^{+}\to c\bar{s}\) in semileptonic \(t\bar{t}\) events and \(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu\to l+\nu\)s in dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) events. For \(\tan\beta<1\) in the MSSM, \(H^{+}\to c\bar{s}\) has a branching ratio of nearly 40% for \(m_{H^{+}}\simeq 130\) GeV, while for \(\tan\beta>1\) the \(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu\) channel dominates and the branching ratio exceeds 90% for \(\tan\beta>3\).

The \(H^{+}\to c\bar{s}\) search in semileptonic \(t\bar{t}\) events follows the same approach as that search at CDF [7]. After a preselection for the semileptonic \(t\bar{t}\) event topology, the search identifies the two light quark jets and considers the corresponding dijet mass distribution. It then employs a dijet mass fitter, which substantially improves the mass resolution. A binned maximum likelihood method which includes systematic uncertainties is then used with the fitted mass shapes to obtain 95% CL upper limits on \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\), assuming \(\mathcal{B}(H^{+}\to c\bar{s})=1\).

In the search for \(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu\to l+\nu\)s in dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) events, two new tools have been used: the helicity angle \(\cos\theta_{t}^{*}\) and the generalized transverse mass \(m_{T2}^{H^{+}}\). After selecting the dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) event topology, both \(\cos\theta_{t}^{*}\) and \(m_{T2}^{H^{+}}\) are used to determine the correct lepton and \(b\)-jet pairing. Having normalized the background MC samples to data in signal free regions, the \(\cos\theta_{t}^{*}\) distribution is used to search for an excess of events (near -1) over the SM prediction for nonzero \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\). The expected 95% CL upper limits on \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\) assuming \(\mathcal{B}(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu)=1\) were evaluated in toy MC experiments where the expected signal and background are fluctuated according to their systematic uncertainties.

For both searches, the 95% CL upper limits substantially improve on the current limits at the Tevatron experiments, with 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity at \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV, see Figure 13.

The LHC is now running at 7 TeV and is scheduled to collect 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data. We have recently reviewed our results for this center-of-mass energy and integrated luminosity, which will be presented in a future report.

Also shown for reference are the current Tevatron upper limits on \(\mathcal{B}(t\to bH^{+})\). No pile-up is included here.
