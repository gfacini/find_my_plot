B0 short or long

Discussions on a possible B0 coil have started with the Conceptual Design Review 1994 asking for an intermediate step between the racetrack coil and the industrial production of the series coils in order to learn a maximum by doing something identical, apart from the length, before the industrial production of the series coils.

At that stage a collaboration for the production of the B0 coil was launched with a view to absorb part of the incremental cost, to try out the "in-kind" contribution mechanism and to enlarge the collaboration base of the Barrel Toroid.

The collaboration has been described in detail in the Addendum 1 to the TMoU and has been signed by all parties. The collaboration works very well.

In the Preliminary Design Review of 1996 the question of a "spare" coil was raised and the notion that a B0 coil extended to full length could become a spare coil.

Finally the MOB (end 1996 and 1997) stressed the point that model work should be done as far as possible in those industries which will do the final series work and on devices or activities as similar as possible to the final ones. Therefore the MOB supported initially the idea of a long B0 coil produced almost under industrial and series production conditions and completely made in industry with close supervision by the laboratories involved in the B0 work.

The path from these recommendations and notions to the decision to maintain the first idea of a short B0 fabricated as expressed in the Addendum 1 is summarised below.

## 2 Discussion

Given the various requests for evaluation, the collaborating magnet laboratories and ATLAS management have carefully analysed the pro and cons.

The long B0 coil, realised in industry as the first of 9 coils produced with special participation and supervision of the collaborating laboratories with special sensors and devices attached for the wanted tests was not retained for contractual and cost reasons.

In order to obtain good offers from the final industries doing the series coils the contracts for the long industrial B0 would have to be written with an option for the series coils for which the magnets laboratories were not ready. Furthermore to obtain RRB authorisation for such a procedure would have been difficult. In addition the desired learning process would lead to contract negotiations concerning the options which might be costly.

To have the whole B0 work done in industry without an option to do the series coils may lead to different industries for the B0 and the series coils which is not desirable. The cost of this procedure was considered to exceed largely what the collaborating laboratories were willing to spend on B0. Therefore this option was not retained.

The long B0 to be made according to the original Addendum 1 was not retained for reasons of considerable increased material and labour cost not covered by the magnet laboratories. Moreover the existing facilities such as lab-space and crane capacity were not adequate.

A change of the signed and RRB approved Addendum 1, would require an agreement between all partners. The RRB did approve the Addendum 1 and the short B0 because of the implied R&D efforts. A change to an industrial full-size B0 would be difficult. The procedure to arrive at a new agreement with all partners would cause an estimated delay in the B0 execution by about one year minimum. It would make the B0 time schedule completely incompatible with the ATLAS master schedule. In particular the present starting date for the manufacturing of the first full-size industrial coil B1 can not maintained.

The existing collaboration proposed therefore to proceed with the original proposal as the fastest and safest way to realize the whole series of coils as argued below:

The production of the conductor is done by two, possibly all firms which will make the final conductors for the Barrel and End-Cap Toroids.

The winding of the B0 coil will be made on the final winding machine which can be extended easily for the long coils. The firm envisaged for this operation itself prefers strongly to have this intermediate step as soon as possible and in preparation of the winding of the long coils.

The fabrication of the coil casing consists of a simple operation, namely to machine the pieces of the coil casing, and a critical operation, namely to assemble these machined parts without distortions to the final casing applying electron beam welding to very thick (>40 cm) material. The device and the procedure used can be applied to the final coil casings.

The tie rods will be the final version also used in the series coils.

The difficult first integration of all pieces of the B0 coil to the assembled coil on the other hand will still be done at Saclay as foreseen in the Addendum 1. This is considered by the collaborators of the B0 to be the most critical activity of the B0 and to be done best in the leading laboratory of the Barrel Toroid.

3. Conclusion

Given the above arguments ATLAS management has decided to continue with the short B0 as originally planned but under strict conditions.

In order to do the B0 exercise successfully the laboratories involved in the B0 coil and the MPG have agreed to a firm list of milestones leading to the B0 coil (see milestones attached).
