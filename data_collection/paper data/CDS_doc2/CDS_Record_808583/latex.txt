## 1 Mother boards

### Introduction

The granularity of the detection cells for the E.M. barrel presampler is \(\Delta\phi\times\Delta\eta\simeq 0.1\times 0.025\). Sixteen detection cells are read out by one MB (2 in \(\phi\) and 8 in \(\eta\)), except for the MB of type 8 where only 10 detection cells are read out (2 in \(\phi\) and 5 in \(\eta\)). The surface covered by each of the first 7 MB types is \(\Delta\phi\times\Delta\eta\simeq 0.2\times 0.2\). The modules and therefore the MBs are arranged in rows (or presampler sectors) composed of 8 modules (or MBs type 1 to 8) in \(\eta\) and 1 module (or MB) in \(\phi\) (\(\Delta\phi=\)2\(\pi\)rd/32 or half a calorimeter module in azimuth, see figure 13).

The functions of the mother boards are :

1. to collect the electronic signals from the presampler,
2. to distribute the calibration pulses,
3. to distribute the high voltage.

### Description of the mother boards

The mother boards (MB's) are 5-layered printed circuits (35 \(\mu\)m, class 4), see figure 1. The overall thickness is \(2.3^{+0}_{-0.2}\) mm, (each of the 5 FR4 layers being about 0.4 mm thick). The trace width (in the signal and injection layers) is 320 \(\pm\) 30 \(\mu\)m in order to obtain an impedance close to 50 \(\Omega\). The finishing, (only the external ground layer of the MB), is tin and lead melted by infrared, and with neither varnish nor sergiraphy applied to the outer surfaces. The function of the additionnal FR4 layer is to protect the MB from the HV buses located on the top of the modules. Only 38 mechanical holes will be machined through this FR4 layer.

There are 8 mother board types of different sizes corresponding to the 8 different modules. They are 169 mm wide and their lengths are equal to 280, 297, 321, 356, 404, 477, 562 and 395 mm for the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, respectively. For a given type of MB, all the signal traces have the same length, and, in the same way, all the injection traces have also the same length. The transit times of signal and calibration pulses are equalized by

25 ppm/\({}^{\circ}\)C, are used.

The calibration method consists in having the injection resistors in the cold and bringing from outside a voltage pulse reproducing the physical signal. The output voltage of the pulser will not exceed 5 V and therefore the injection resistors are adjusted to the dynamic range.

Monte Carlo simulations show that the maximun current will be of the order of 100 \(\mu\)A, see figure 10.

The schematic diagram of the injection system on the mother boards is shown on figure 11. There will be 17 44 \(\Omega\), 16 of 51 \(\Omega\) and 2 K\(\Omega\) resistors per MB. The injection line remains adapted to 50 \(\Omega\) even if one of the 51 \(\Omega\) resistors is not or badly connected. The 2 K\(\Omega\) resistors are soldered as close as possible to the detection cell connection points in order to keep the total detector capacitance small.

### Calibration cabling

Eight coaxial cables of the same type will be used to distribute the calibration signals (1 per module). One extremity is soldered on the proper MB and the other one on a special pad located at the end of the MB 8. Sixteen holtites are inserted in this pad in order to receive 2 "AXON 4x2 points low profile" connectors, of the same type as those used for the calorimeter, see figure 15. The lengths of the coaxial cables are adjusted to provide a time distribution of the signals close to the particle time of the flight sequence, see table 3.

The required stripping dimensions are the same as for signal cables, i.e. : conductor wire / isolation / braided shield = 3 mm / 2 mm / 3 mm.

### High Voltage distribution

The high voltage is supplied via 8 coaxial kapton cables per presampler sector (\(\Delta\phi\simeq 0.2\)) : 2 lines for each pair of contiguous modules in \(\eta\) with the left and the right sides of the anodes separately connected. This design will prevent from the full loss of a module in case of sparks. The HV cable shields are soldered at one of their extremities to the ground of the mother boards and left unconnected at the other side, ended by a special HV 8-channel connector located close to the center of the calorimeter "low front patch panel". The lengths of the HV cables are given in table 4. The required stripping dimensions are : conductor wire / isolation / braided shield = 3 mm / 5 mm / 3 mm.

Figure 16 shows the design and the arrangement of the cables.

## Radiation levels and qualification

The maximum doses in the ATLAS E.M. calorimeter for 10 years of operation is expected to be around \(2.10^{14}\) neutrons/cm\({}^{2}\) and 500 KRad.

In September 1997, 2 mother boards were irradiated with neutrons (\(\sim 2.10^{14}\)\(n/cm^{2}\)) at liquid argon temperature at the SARA facility in Grenoble. Possible signal loss was measured using an alpha cell immersed in liquid argon. But no significant pollution was observed which allows us to continue the production process.
