A highly portable, PC-based liquid argon purity monitor (APM) system was constructed in 1995 for the purpose of FCAL argon poisoning studies. The mechanical construction and readout electronics are described in detail. The system was used to monitor the liquid argon purity for a beam test of a brass EM FCAL module during the months of July-September 1995. This was the first major test of the system outside of bench studies during its development. Results from the beam test are reported. Improvements to the system based on this experience are under way.

## 1 Dynamics of source-based APM's

The operation of ionization detectors depends upon the mean number of ion pairs produced by the ionizing particle and on the fraction which can be collected by an applied field. The average energy required to produce an ion pair in liquid argon is 23.6 eV. In the absence of impurities, the charge collection is affected by two processes: germinate and columnar recombination. Germinate recombination is the process where the electron produced by ionization does not escape the parent ion but is driven back to recombine with it. A severe recombination occurs in the case of heavily ionizing particles such as low energy \(\alpha\)-particles; it is very small in the case of minimum ionizing particles (MIP's). The recombination for MIP's is so small that it has not been measured independent of trapping by impurities in the liquid argon [1]. Those ionization electrons which do not undergo germinate recombination are then free to drift to the anode of the device under the influence of an applied electric field. However, because the ionization density along a track is large in liquids, the drifting electrons can meet positive ions and recombine. This is columnar recombination. This is, however, an effect which need only be taken into account at very low values of the applied field, where the drift velocity of the free electrons is small.

The electrons which do not undergo recombination drift through the liquid under the influence of the electric field; some eventually reach the anode while others are trapped by impurities in the liquid to form negative ions. Since the mobility of these ions is orders of magnitude smaller than the drifting electrons, they do not contribute to the prompt electric pulse seen at the anode. The effect of trapping by impurities is to reduce the collected charge. For a parallel plate geometry where the ionization is evenly distributed between the plates (as would be the case for a MIP traversing the gap), the ratio of the collected charge \(Q\) to the charge \(Q_{0}\) which would be collected in the absence of trapping is given by [2]:

\[\frac{Q}{Q_{0}}=\frac{2\lambda}{D}\left[1-\frac{\lambda}{D}\left(1-e^{-D/ \lambda}\right)\right]\]

where \(\lambda\) is the mean free path length for the attachment of the electrons, and \(D\) is the interelectrode distance. For ionization produced near one side of the gap, as is the case for \(\alpha\)-particle ionization, this equation becomes:

\[\frac{Q}{Q_{0}}=\frac{\lambda}{D}\left(1-e^{-D/\lambda}\right).\]

The dependence of \(\lambda\) on the electric field \(E\), and on the concentration \(p\) of impurities, is of crucial importance in the design of radiation detectors [1]. The evidence available thus far supports the view that in liquid argon, before they are trapped, the electrons drift a mean distance which is inversely proportional to the impurity concentration and approximately proportional to the magnitude of the electric field:

\[\lambda=\frac{\alpha E}{p}\]

where \(p\) is expressed as the ratio of the number of impurity atoms (or molecules ) to the number of argon atoms, and \(\alpha\) is the _trapping constant_. This trapping constant is impurity dependent (for example, it is approximately 200 times larger for N\({}_{2}\) contamination, which is practically harmless in most liquid ionization detectors ). However, because O\({}_{2}\) was identified early on as a serious liquid argon contaminant, this trapping constant is usually used to describe the effects of other contaminants in terms of O\({}_{2}\)-equivalent concentrations. For the LAr/O\({}_{2}\) system, the trapping constant is

\[\alpha=(15\pm 3)\times 10^{-9}\ \ \mathrm{mm^{2}/V}\]

Fig. 1 shows the theoretical charge yield as a function of applied electric field (0 - 12 kV/cm) on a parallel plate ionization detector, for three different impurity concentrations. For the \(\alpha\)-signal there is a significant amount of initial recombination; increasing the electric field has the effect of reducing this recombination, but even at 10 kV/cm less than 10% of the ionization charge is collected. For the \(\beta\)-signal, there is very little initial recombination, so the collected charge quickly saturates to its maximum value. This can be beneficial since at high enough electric field it provides a charge which is relatively insensitive to impurity concentration, a feature which will be utilized in the APM design.

## 2 The APM Hardware

Many APM's have been been developed over the years, most using radioactive sources of one type or another to produce ionization. We have chosen to build and develop a D0-type APM [3]. An isometric view of the detector is shown in Fig. 2. The monitor consists of two ionization gaps formed by three G10 substrates (signal, HV, and trigger planes) stacked on each other with 2.3 mm spacers between them. The outer two planes are 1.6 mm thick, while the HV plane is 0.8 mm thick. The center strata was chosen to be as thin as possible to allow \(\beta\)'s traversing the first gap to enter the second with as little energy loss as possible. The first gap (the _signal gap_) houses two separate cells, one equipped with an \({}^{241}\)Am \(\alpha\)-source, the other with a \({}^{106}\)Ru \(\beta\)-source. The \(\alpha\)-source consists

of a 25.4 mm stainless steel disk onto which the radionuclide was electrodeposited with an active diameter of 5 mm. Ruthenium oxide locked in a ceramic matrix and encased in a 5 mm diameter stainless steel canister serves as the \(\beta\)-source. This canister is placed in a specially designed holder to give it the same dimensions as the \(\alpha\)-source. The surfaces of the sources serve as the signal electrodes. G10 spacers are used above the sources to maintain the 2.3 mm ionization gap. These spacers, shown in Fig. 2, have radial channels cut in them to allow for liquid argon flow through the gap. The second ionization gap (the _trigger gap_) simply holds the spacers required to maintain a 2.3 mm gap.

Electrically, each of the G10 substrates have copper pads etched on their surfaces. The signal gaps are readout via the outer substrate, which is in contact with the sources. The trigger gaps is readout via the third outer substrate. The center substrate is a double sided board and provides separate high voltages for each of the gaps.

Because of the nature of the ionization process and the sources used, three signals are read out from the cell. The \(\alpha\)-particles are heavily ionizing and lose their energy very close to the source. The electrons that result from the ionization drift through the gaps above the source, and one signal is derived from this cell. The \(\beta\) is able to traverse

both the first and second ionization gaps, providing two signals for the readout. In this manner, the trigger gap gives a signal which can be used to ensure that only energetic \(\beta\)'s emitted in a small solid angle are accepted for the measurements.

The entire cell structure is housed in an aluminum die-cast box shown in Fig. 3.

The high voltage and signal planes are wired to SHV and lemo feedthroughs on the box respectively. These connections were tested with liquid nitrogen prior to operation to ensure that good contact was maintained with signal cables in the cold.

## 3 The APM Readout Electronics

### The design philosophy

The design of the electronics follows very closely that described in [3], but does include some significant changes. To minimize noise pick-up, the pre-amps were designed to be stand alone devices placed as close as possible to the ionization cell. The rest of the electronics (shapers, triggering logic, PC interface) were packaged into a small, highly portable, NM standard module. This ensures that the system could be easily transported to various sites for liquid argon poisoning studies. The decision to make the system completely computer controlled by a PC required that the triggering logic and computer interface be designed to match the capabilities of a commercially available ADC card.

Figure 3: The APM cell enclosure. The cell is mounted on 25 mm G10 spacers to centre it in the box. High voltage and signal connectors are placed on one end. There are multiple holes on all four sides of the box to allow for good argon flow.

### The pre-amplifier design

The number of ionization electrons available to be read out when an \(\alpha\) or \(\beta\)-particle is emitted from the source is small. Assuming that all the energy of an \(\alpha\)-particle from \({}^{241}\)Am is available in the ionization process (5.4 MeV), there are initially \(2.3\times 10^{5}\) electrons produced. However, because of initial recombination, the net yield is an order of magnitude smaller than this. As discussed earlier the \(\beta\) ionization is quite different than the \(\alpha\) ionization. For a gap width of 2.3 mm, \(2.1\times 10^{4}\) electrons are produced and most are available for impurity attachment (a yield comparable in number to the \(\alpha\)-cell).

Because of the very small signals produced in both of the ionization cells, care was taken to use low-noise electronics to keep the signal to noise ratio as large as possible. The pre-amps were housed in a separate box located as close to the ionization cell as possible (on the warm side of a cryostat). The pre-amp circuit used is shown in Fig. 4.

A separate pre-amp was used for each of the signal cells, and also for the trigger gap in the \(\beta\)- cell. The pre-amps were attached to a distribution board which provided power for their operation. This board also provided attenuation circuitry for test pulser signals so that calibration pulses could be injected into the front end of the pre-amps.

The preamp is a common source FET design which is charge sensitive in the bandwidth of interest, and presents a very high signal gain on the order of 0.1 \(\mu\)V/e\({}^{-}\). An equivalent noise of 500 electrons for this circuit has been measured on the test bench. The circuit noise as an output voltage is determined dominantly by the FET

Figure 4: The APM pre-amplifier circuit. A number of JFET’s were tested at Q1, with the 2SK152 giving the best results. Q2 was a 2SK6523 pnp transistor, while both Q3 and Q4 were 2SK6521’s.

and the gain set point of the rest of the amplifier, and is essentially independent of the front end conditions. This means that it is very useful for capacitive cells such as the APM. The required operational frequency for the APM is not high, being \(\sim\)1MHz. The best available devices are audio JFET's. Three acceptable JFET's were compared: the 2SK152, 2SK147, and 2N4416A. The 2SK152 operated with the best noise characteristics, with the 2SK147 a close second. The differences seen between the two could have been due to batch variations.

#### 3.2.1 Circuit analysis

The FET gate is connected directly to the signal source, which has only capacitive connections other than a very large value feedback resistor. The front end is therefore a pure integrating capacitor, and the signal is seen at the FET base as a voltage proportional to the integral of the signal current from the cell. This voltage results in a proportional current at the FET drain, which the drain resistor converts to a voltage. This voltage drives a current across the emitter resistor of Q2, since its base is tied to a fixed bias point. This current is then once again converted to a voltage by the emitter follower stage Q3 driving the line load. The output is low pass filtered by the output blocking capacitor, at a corner frequency of \(1/(2\pi\cdot C_{out}\cdot 2\cdot Z_{0})\). The choice of this capacitor determines the recovery rate of the circuit, and also the shape of the waveforms in the following shaping filters. The high frequency limit is determined dominantly by internal capacitances in the circuit. The circuit is stabilized by the feedback loop consisting of a large value resistor (10M\(\Omega\)) in parallel with a small value capacitor. The purpose of this component is to stabilize the DC bias of the rest of the circuit, and to compensate for the cell signal, considered as a DC leakage current. The theoretical discussion of this circuit may be found in [4], wherein it is asserted that capacitive feedback will compensate for the low frequency response of the circuit. In practice, this is only barely true. The frequency response of the circuit may be inferred from the shape of the Fourier transform of the output noise, and from analytic or numeric calculations of the frequency response. Preliminary measurements and calculations indicate that the circuit does indeed operate on the descending slope of the forward frequency characteristic, which is the assumption leading to the compensation assertion. However, there are several capacitances in the circuit giving time constants, both poles and zeros, which lie very close to each other and to the operating point. These give rise to very complex behavior in the region of interest, which is only partly compensated by the feedback capacitor. Fortunately, this does not affect the measurement of the parameter of interest. Unfortunately, it does result in a very large intrinsic gain for the dominant noise frequencies at very low frequencies. This results in significant low frequency bounce in the output signal.

### The shaper design

The shaper circuitry was designed to accommodate a PC-based voltage sensing ADC. The output voltage of the shaper cards had to reflect the collected charge in the cell. The shaper circuit is shown in Fig. 5

The \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) and \(\beta\)-trigger channels each used the same shaper layout. The boards were designed so that each channel could be read out independently, that is, self-triggered in stand-alone mode. It uses only single pole or zero stages, and is therefore very stable and relatively immune to problems of component tolerances. The first two stages provide the primary bandpass filter, centred on 2MHz. The shoulders are very shallow, at \(\pm\)3dB/decade, so the rejection of adjacent frequencies is not strong. This is necessary to produce the correct shape, but unfortunately admits a lot of the dominant front end noise as well. The output of this stage (labeled "Trigger Out" in Fig. 5) goes to the trigger circuitry and into the

Figure 5: A block schematic of the shaper circuitry. Two signals are derived from this board, a fast trigger pulse (“Trigger Out”) plus a stretched out signal pulse. The delay between the two is required in order to make a pedestal measurement of the shaper output to eliminate baseline shifting effects.

delay line, which provides about \(18\mu s\) of delay for measurement of pedestal values after the trigger. Owing to difficulty in obtaining suitable delay circuits, delays were built using lumped inductances and capacitances, in six stages per delay line. The first trials were built with hand wound toroids. However, subsequent circuits were built using mass produced mini-inductors, ganged in back to back pairs to improve noise rejection. Both solutions proved satisfactory. The extracted "'Trigger Out" signal is discriminated to provide the trigger pulse for the acquisition hardware. For the \(\alpha\)-cell, this signal is used for self-triggering. To trigger the \(\beta\)-cell, the "Trigger Out" signal from the \(\beta\)-trigger cell was used.

The delay line output goes into an isolation stage, which also restores the baseline, and then to an integrator. The output signal is sampled at the peak of the integrator stage output, about \(20\mu s\) after the trigger. The different pulse shapes and their relative timing to a pulser input are shown in Fig. 6.

The shaper circuit depends on getting a long decay time integrated signal from the preamp. This is easily provided, but results in the unfortunate inclusion of the low frequency \(1/f\) noise also. This is because the 3dB/decade slope of the bandpass filter cannot compete with the rising gain curve of the preamp. A useful addition to the shaper would therefore be a sharp cut low frequency filter at a frequency like 100kHz. This would reduce the general noise acceptance by some amount, and will also reduce the low frequency bounce which is particularly troublesome for low threshold triggering. Correspondingly, the high frequency response, above 2MHz or so, contributes nothing to

the signal, but includes a lot of induced noise. It would be useful to add a sharp cut high frequency filter to reduce this noise contribution.

### Triggering logic for the APM

To minimize the effects of baseline shifting in the shaper circuitry, two measurements of the shaper output signal are made. First, a pedestal measurement is made just before the integrated pulse begins to rise. The second measurement is timed to correspond to the peak of the integrated pulse. The trigger circuitry is shown in Fig. 7.

The "Trigger Out" signal from the shaper board is first amplified and compared to an adjustable threshold level. If the signal passes this discrimination, it is used to generate a "hold" signal for a Sample-and-Hold circuit. In the mean time, as long as the readout is not in a busy state, the pedestal measurement has also been sampled and held. Therefore

Figure 7: The APM trigger logic. The peak and pedestal voltages of the shaper output are sampled and held when the “Trigger Out” signal from the shaper surpasses the adjustable threshold level. The time difference between the peak and pedestal measurement is externally adjustable (“Peak delay adjust”). The “Ready Out” is used to trigger the PC-based DAQ board.

two voltage levels (pedestal and peak) are passed onto the readout board, plus a "Ready out" signal to trigger it. These voltage levels are held until the readout has completed its digitization and generates a "Clear" signal. The relative timing between the pedestal and peak measurements is also externally adjustable from 13 - 20 \(\mu\,s\).

## 4 The PC-based Readout and Control Interface

The readout and control of the APM is completely computerized using a PC in conjunction with a National Instruments AT-MIO-16E-10 dat a acquisition board. This board has 16 single ended analog input channels, each with 12 bits of resolution, a programmable gain, and capable of a maximum sampling rate of 100 KS/s. This device also has 8 digital I/O channels, plus an additional 8 digital lines which could be programmed to receive trigger pulses. Two timer lines can be used for pulse generation. Two 12 bit analog output DAC's are also critical to the data acquisition system.

Six of the analog input lines are used to measure each of the signals' pedestal and peak values (\(\alpha\), \(\beta\), \(\beta\)-trigger). Two channels are used to monitor the HV levels on the APM, while another two for reading back the \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) trigger threshold levels. Two digital lines monitor the HV supply's trip indicators. Two of the boards digital trigger lines are used to accept the "Ready" signals from the triggering logic when events are being held. "Clear" signals are generated on the timer lines to release the held voltages. The analog output DAC's are used to remotely set the signal and trigger gaps' high voltage.

The readout software is written in LabView. It was written to maintain as many different data acquisition configurations as possible. It also monitors vital online information. Data can be acquired in three different ways. The first is a manual configuration, where the user sets the signal gap HV and the number of events to acquire. The second allows for a HV scan to be acquired, with the lower and upper bounds on the signal gap HV being set along with the number of intervals between the bounds. A set number of triggers can then be acquired at each interval. Finally, a prepared run configuration file can be loaded and executed automatically. Each line of this file can contain information on the HV to set and the number of triggers to acquire. In the first two configurations one type of data can be acquired (\(\alpha\) or \(\beta\)), while in the automatic mode, each line can set a different trigger type.

As well as these triggering options, other options exist for the display and storage of the data. HV scans are displayed online after acquisition. Every acquired event can be stored, or simply the mean and sigma of the trigger set. During a scan the mean value of a completed trigger set is always displayed. The HV on the trigger and signal gaps is continually monitored graphically on the PC, as well as the trip state of the supply. Options also exist for the automatic repetition of measurements.

## 5 Purity Monitoring for the 1995 FCAL Beam Test

### Beam test setup

This APM system was transported to CERN during July-September of 1995 and used during the beam test of the FCAL EM module. This was the first major test of the system outside of bench studies during its development. A schematic of the test beam setup is shown in Fig. 8.

The APM ionization cell was placed beside the FCAL module and submerged in approximately 75 litres of liquid argon. Teflon core and jacketed coaxial cables were used to connect the cell to a feedthrough on the top of the cryostat for both the HV and the signals. On the warm side of the cryostat lid, the pre-amp box was placed as close as possible to the feedthrough. A local low voltage supply powered the pre-amps. The signals from the pre-amps were driven 10 metres along coaxial cable to the NIM module housing the shapers and triggering logic. The cell high voltage was supplied by a VKA 6900 Dual MWPC power supply housed in the same NIM crate. Before entering the cryostat, each of the two HV lines was filtered.

Figure 8: The APM configuration during the 1995 beam test. The HV filters and pre-amp box were placed on the warm side of the cryostat lid very close to their feedthroughs. The signals coming from the cell were grounded at the cryostat lid.

### Beam test results

As this beam test represented the first implementation of the entire system, a number of problems were encountered, the most serious of which was noise. Although the circuitry performed very well under test conditions when subjected to a calibration pulser, unacceptably large pick-up was encountered at the front end of the pre-amps when they were attached to the cryostat and the ionization cell. Although a number of techniques were employed to try to minimize this noise, it remained high. Further investigations to improve the grounding and shielding schemes of the APM are underway. However, for the purposes of the beam test, the noise effectively limited the usefulness of the \(\alpha\)-channel and no results were obtained from it. On the other hand, because the \(\beta\)-channel had the capability of being independently triggered by the trigger gap, even very small signals could be picked out of the noise. Therefore it was possible to make HV scans with this channel.

To determine the purity of the liquid argon, triggers were collected at cell high voltages ranging from 0 - 10 kV/cm. The trigger gap was maintained at a high voltage of 5 kV/cm. Fig. 9 shows the results of one such HV scan of the \(\beta\)-cell performed during the beam test. The fitted curve is a convolution of functions to account for ion recombination [5]

Figure 9: An argon purity HV scan. Results of the curve fitted indicate an O\({}_{2}\) equivalent argon impurity of 0.5 ppm.

and liquid argon impurity trapping [2]. For the \(\beta\)-cell, ion recombination is small, but the Thomas prescription [5] was included for completeness. Such HV scans were taken twice per day for each day that the experiment was running. The results showed that the purity of the argon during the running period remained constant at about 0.5 ppm O\({}_{2}\) equivalent. These results were consistent with an O\({}_{2}\) analyzer used throughout the run period. To be sure that the cell was indeed properly measuring argon impurities, air was purposely introduced into the cryostat at the end of the beam test. The APM responded as expected in measuring an increase in the impurities. Fig. 10 is a summary plot showing the measured impurities throughout the beam test run.

## 6 Future work and development

Investigations continue in a number of areas. As this test beam represented the first major test of the monitor system, a number of problems arose which will require further study and modification of the system. Induced noise was seen to increase the measured noise from the minimum lab measurement of 500 equivalent electrons to over 2000 electrons.

Figure 10: Summary of measured argon impurities during the test beam run. The large impurities indicated near the end of the run were measurements taken when air was purposely introduced into the liquid argon.

This resulted in the \(\alpha\)-channel being marginal at best. It is clear that the grounding scheme has to be improved to increase the signal to noise ratio by eliminating ground loops. As well, a significant amount of time was spent optimizing the readout and trigger timing of the electronics. This has led to a few slight modifications of the electronics to improve its performance. These changes will be reflected in upcoming revisions of the electronics boards.

The preamp noise is dominated by thermal noise, which is proportional to \(1/f\). By reason of the large gain, it is reasonable to suppose that this noise is dominantly generated in the FET itself. We wish to verify this on the bench, in order to ensure that no other noise source is making a significant contribution. Under this assumption, it is in principle possible to obtain a further 50% reduction in noise by operating the FET at cryogenic temperatures. Because the signal gain is inversely proportional to the input capacitance, the relative noise figure is proportional to the input capacitance. Therefore it is desirable to reduce the capacitance of all cabling and extraneous equipment at the front end by placing the FET in the cold, beside the cell.
