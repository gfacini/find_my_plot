The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

This note documents updated prospects for studies of \(H\to Z\gamma\) at the HL-LHC, building on the analysis documented following the European Committee for Future Accelerators workshop in 2013 with the addition of background yield corrections and more sensitive kinematic categories. The ultimate expected reach of the ATLAS experiment, with an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), assuming average pile-up corresponding to \(\mu\)=140, is discussed in detail, and its intermediate potential with 300 fb\({}^{-1}\)and \(\mu\)=60 is briefly described. Assuming the Higgs boson discovered in 2012 with a mass of 125 GeV to be the Standard Model Higgs boson, the expected local significance is 3.9(2.3) \(\sigma\) with 3000(300) fb\({}^{-1}\).

Introduction

The channel \(H\to Z\gamma\) is interesting because in the Standard Model the decay proceeds proceeds entirely via loops, predominantly involving heavy charged particles, a property that makes it sensitive to possible new heavy states [1, 2, 3]. The measurement of the \(H\to Z\gamma\) decay rate can also provide insight into physics beyond the SM. For example, it can be used to differentiate between a Higgs boson and other electroweak singlets and triplets [2, 3].

On the experimental side, this channel suffers from a large background of Z bosons accompanied by radiative photons. With the full Run I data collected by the ATLAS detector, the observed (expected) 95% CL limit is 11 (9) \(\times\sigma_{SM}\) at \(m_{H}\)=125.5 GeV with the background-only assumption [4]. The high-luminosity data of the HL-LHC will be crucial for detecting this channel and for measuring the \(H\to Z\gamma\) coupling.

This note documents updated prospects for studies of \(H\to Z\gamma\) at the HL-LHC, building on the analysis documented following the European Committee for Future Accelerators workshop [5] in 2013 with the addition of background yield corrections and more sensitive kinematic categories. The assumption of the ultimate reach of the ATLAS detector is an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)with average pile-up \(\mu\)=140. The intermediate potential for 300 fb\({}^{-1}\)and \(\mu\)=60 is also briefly discussed.

## 2 \(Z\gamma\) event selection

The reconstruction of \(H\to Z\gamma\) is simulated by applying parametrized performance assumptions to generator-level particles. These give the expected performance of electrons, muons and photons at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 14 TeV and average pile-up per bunch crossing \(\mu\)=140 [6]. Only the \(Z\to ee\) and \(Z\to\mu\mu\) final states are considered in the selection. Particle four-momenta are smeared before kinematic cuts with the expected detector resolution at 14 TeV. The identification efficiencies are considered for the leading leptons and photons based on their momenta and their detector positions. In order to be selected, an event must fire either a single-lepton trigger with a 25 GeV threshold, or a double-lepton trigger with a 15 GeV threshold. These \(p_{T}\) thresholds introduce 1.2% inefficiency with respect to the offline selection for signal events.

The selection of the \(Z\gamma\) events follows closely the selection developed for the \(H\to Z\gamma\) search in ATLAS at Run I [4]:

* Two same-flavor opposite-sign electrons or muons.
* One photon with \(E_{T}>\)15 GeV, within \(|\eta|<\)2.37 and outside the transition region \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\). It is required to be separated from the selected leptons with \(\Delta R>\)0.3.
* Electrons: \(p_{T}>\)10 GeV and \(|\eta|<\)2.47
* Muons: \(p_{T}>\)10 GeV and \(|\eta|<\)2.7
* \(m_{ll}>m_{Z}^{\rm PDG}-10\) GeV.

Other processes, including \(WZ\), \(ZZ\) and \(t\bar{t}\) processes, contribute less than 1% of the selected events in the 8 TeV analysis [4]. These processes are neglected in this study.

The signal sample consists of Powheg Monte Carlo simulated events generated at 14 TeV with a 125 GeV Higgs boson. The \(Z\) boson candidate, which is the decay product of the Higgs boson, is simulated to decay into \(e^{+}e^{-}\), \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\). The results of the selection on signal events are shown in Table 1. The Sherpa background samples are generated at 14 TeV with a Z boson and at least one initial- or a final-state-radiation photon with \(p_{T}>\)10 GeV. The background shape is taken from this \(Z+\gamma\) continuum MonteCarlo. The smaller \(Z\)+jets contribution is assumed to have the same shape. The size of the background is evaluated by scaling the background from the 8 TeV analysis by the \(Z+\gamma\) continuum cross section ratio \(\sigma^{Z\gamma}_{14\text{TeV}}/\sigma^{Z\gamma}_{8\text{TeV}}\)=1.82, and scaled by factors to correct from the Run I to the HL-LHC efficiencies, including photon ID (63%), lepton ID (97%) and lepton trigger (97%), giving an overall acceptance ratio of 59% [6, 7]. The acceptance at 8 TeV includes assumptions of a photon ID efficiency of 82%, a lepton ID efficiency of 86% and a trigger efficiency of 98% [4] for the \(Z+\gamma\) background process. It is assumed that photon background arising from pile-up interactions can be neglected.

Signal and background distributions of \(m_{ll\gamma}\) and \(m_{ll\gamma}-m_{ll}\) after the full selection are shown in Figure 1. The variable \(m_{ll\gamma}\) is used for the signal search.

### Categorization

To enhance the sensitivity of the signal search, the events are divided into three categories in each final state, according to their \(p_{Tt}\) and \(|\Delta\eta_{Z\gamma}|\), following the procedure used for the 7+8 TeV analysis [4]. The \(p_{Tt}\) is defined as the projection of \(p_{T}^{Z\gamma}\) onto the thrust axis, which is defined by the direction of the difference in \(p_{T}\) between the \(Z\) boson and the photon, as shown in Figure 2.

Events with \(p_{Tt}\) larger than 30 GeV are put in the high-\(p_{Tt}\) category. The remaining events are put in the low-\(p_{Tt}\) low-\(|\Delta\eta_{Z\gamma}|\) category (\(|\Delta\eta_{Z\gamma}|\) less than 2.0) or the low-\(p_{Tt}\) high-\(|\Delta\eta_{Z\gamma}|\) category (\(|\Delta\eta_{Z\gamma}|\) larger than or equal to 2.0).

### Signal and background parametrization

In each category, the reconstructed signal \(m_{l\gamma}\) invariant mass is parametrized as the sum of a Crystal Ball lineshape and a Gaussian function, fixing the fraction of events in each category to the MC predictions.

A model for the background is constructed for each category by choosing a function with sufficient flexibility (a seventh order Chebychev polynomial is used) and fitting it to the background-only MC. The function thus obtained is then used to generate background pseudo-datasets equivalent to 3000 \(\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\)of integrated luminosity. In each category, the background pseudo-datasets are fitted using a signal plus a particular tested background model. The systematic uncertainty (bias) of the background parametrization in the signal region due to the tested background model is the average number of fitted signal events for \(m_{H}\)=125 GeV. The functions that are tested to model the background distributions include an exponential, exponentiated polynomials, second to fourth order Bernstein or Chebychev polynomials. The pseudo-dataset generation and fitting are repeated 1000 times for each tested background model in each category, with the mean value of fitted signal events over the background expectation in the region under the signal peak taken as the final systematic uncertainty. One example of pseudo-datasets with the \(ee\gamma\) and \(\mu\mu\gamma\) final states combined can be found in Figure 3. In each category, the background function is chosen

to be the one that has the fewest free parameters while satisfying the requirement that the systematic uncertainty due to the background modeling be less than 5% of the expected SM signal yield after the selection.

Table 2 shows the selected background models and the correponding systematic uncertainty in each category on the background parametrization for \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\).

The fitted mass shapes are shown in Figure 4. The fit range is optimized based on the total fitted significance.

### Other systematic uncertainties

The following systematic uncertainties are included:

* Luminosity uncertainty 3% 1 Footnote 1: Based on the experience gained with luminosity measurements at LHC Run-I, it is anticipated that it will be possible to measure the luminosity at HL-LHC with an uncertainty of about 3%. This level of uncertainty should also be achievable by indirect measurements, from the observed rate of \(Z\to ll\) production, for which the theoretical accuracy is already at the level of 3 to 4%.
* Signal reconstruction efficiencies: 3% on photon ID for both \(e\nu\) and \(\mu\mu\gamma\) final states, 3% on electron ID for \(e\nu\) final state only. Other efficiency uncertainties are assumed to be negligible. [4]
* The Higgs boson decay branching ratio uncertainty is estimated to be 8.9% and the cross section uncertanties used are listed in Table 3[8].
* The resolution uncertainty on the signal shape is 10% in the \(H\to Z\gamma\to ee\gamma\) final state and 3% in \(H\to Z\gamma\to\mu\mu\gamma\) one, taken from the 8 TeV analysis [4].

## 3 Results

The final discrimination between signal and background events is based on a likelihood fit to the \(m_{\ell\ell\gamma}\) spectra. The likelihood function depends on a single parameter of interest, the Higgs boson production

signal strength \(\mu\), defined as the signal yield normalized to the SM expectation, as well as on several nuisance parameters that describe the shape and normalization of the background distributions in each category and the systematic uncertainties.

The final model, obtained from the product of the likelihood functions for each event category, includes eight nuisance parameters describing theory uncertainties (five for the scales and two for PDFs as in Table 3, one for the \(H\to Z\gamma\) branching ratio) and five for the experimental uncertainties (luminosity, photon and electron ID, mass resolution and background modeling systematics). Including the background normalization parameters (six, independently for \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) final states) and the background shape parameters (twelve) the total number of nuisance parameters is thirty-one. For each of the nuisance parameters describing systematic uncertainties the likelihood is multiplied by a constraint term which exploits the experimental estimate of the systematic uncertainty evaluated as described in Sec. 2.2 and Sec. 2.3. For systematic uncertainties affecting the expected total signal yields for different lepton flavours, a log-normal constraint is used.

Table 4 shows the number of signal and background events in the mass region 122 GeV\(<m_{ll\gamma}<\)128 GeV, and the signal to background ratio at 14 TeV for 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity. The average FWHM on \(m_{ll\gamma}\) is 3.4 GeV. With 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)data collected by the ATLAS detector, at \(m_{H}\)=125 GeV,

* The expected CL limit in the absence of a Higgs signal is 0.52\(\times\sigma_{\rm SM}\).
* The expected \(p_{0}\), assuming the presence of a SM Higgs signal with \(m_{H}\)=125 GeV, is 3.9 \(\sigma\)
* The expected measured signal strength with the uncertainties is \(1.00^{+0.25}_{-0.26}(stat.)^{+0.17}_{-0.15}(sys.)\). The dominant systematic on the signal strength measurement is the signal mass resolution.

The prospects for obtaining an intermediate result with 300 fb\({}^{-1}\)of data collected by the ATLAS detector at 14 TeV have also been studied, assuming that these data will be taken with a lower pile-up rate of \(\mu\)=60, allowing the 8 TeV photon ID efficiency to be used. With the fitting method and background modeling uncertainties linearly scaled with luminosity at \(m_{H}=125\) GeV from 8 TeV analysis [4], and the other systematics mentioned in this note, the expected \(p_{0}\) is 2.3 \(\sigma\).
