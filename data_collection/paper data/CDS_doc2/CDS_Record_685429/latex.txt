The sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment to low mass SM Higgs produced via Vector Boson Fusion mechanism is investigated. An event selection has been chosen to optimize the expected signal significance for \(115<M_{H}<130\,\mbox{GeV}\) with the channel \(H\to W^{+}W^{-}\to l^{+}l^{-}/\!\!\!\!/_{T}\). The improvement in signal significance with respect to previous analyses ranges between \(20\%\) and \(30\%\). Likelihood ratios are implemented in the calculation of confidence levels to improve the signal significance. This improves the signal significance by an additional \(10-15\%\).

Introduction

In the Standard Model (SM), there are 4 gauge vector bosons (gluon, photon, W and Z) and 12 fermions (six quarks and six leptons) [1]. These particles have been observed experimentally. The SM predicts the existence of one scalar boson, the Higgs boson [2]. The discovery of the Higgs boson remains one of the major cornerstones of the SM.

Nowadays, the observation of the Higgs boson is a primary focus of the of ATLAS detector [3]. It is most interesting to investigate the observability of the Higgs boson in a similar mass range in the conditions of the LHC with the ATLAS detector.

In this note we consider the production of Higgs via vector boson fusion (VBF). An early analysis performed at the parton level with the decay \(H\to W^{+}W^{-}\) indicated that this process could be the most powerful discovery mode in the range of the Higgs mass, \(M_{H}\), \(115<M_{H}<\,200\,\mathrm{GeV}\)[4]. A first analysis using a simulation of the ATLAS detector has been presented in [5, 6]. Improvements of the analysis presented in [5, 6] are proposed for the Higgs mass range \(115<M_{H}<130\,\mathrm{GeV}\). In this mass range the observation of the Higgs boson at the LHC is most challenging.

## 2 Higgs Production via Vector Boson Fusion

The Higgs at the LHC is produced predominantly via gluon-gluon fusion. For Higgs masses such that \(M_{H}>100\,\mathrm{GeV}\) the second dominant process is vector boson fusion. The lowest order Feynman diagram of the production of Higgs via VBF is depicted in Figure 1. The decay channel chosen is \(H\to W^{+}W^{-}\to e^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}\nu\overline{\nu},\;e^{+}e^{-}\nu\overline{ \nu},\;\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\nu\overline{\nu}\)1. Depending on \(M_{H}\), one or both of the decaying \(W\)'s may be off-shell.

Footnote 1: These channels will also be referred to as \(e\mu\), \(ee\), \(\mu\mu\), respectively.

Earlier analyses of the production of Higgs bosons via Vector Boson Fusion were initially optimized for Higgs masses around the threshold of \(W^{+}W^{-}\) production and improved for masses closeto the limit placed by the LEP experiments [4]. Additionally, the identification of decay channels of the Higgs produced via VBF provides a privileged tool to study a number of properties of the Higgs boson due to the relatively small theoretical uncertainties in the VBF matrix element calculation [7]. In particular, the absolute normalization of the \(HWW\) coupling is accessible via the extraction of the \(H\to W^{+}W^{-}\) partial width in VBF.

The guidelines of the present study have been defined in analyses performed at the parton level [4]. It is relevant to understand the extent of the impact of partonic shower, hadronization and detector simulations on the expected production rates of the signal and the corresponding backgrounds.

### Generation of Signal and Background Processes

The cross-section for the VBF process has been obtained with the matrix element calculation provided within PYTHIA 6.1[8]. The Higgs branching ratio to two \(W\)'s, have been calculated with the package HDECAY[9]. Table 1 shows the values of the Higgs branching ratio to two \(W\)'s as obtained by PYTHIA 6.1 and HDECAY. The values obtained with PYTHIA 6.1 are systematically lower than those obtained with HDECAY.

The basic signature of this process is:

* Two oppositely charged leptons (a muon and an electron, two electrons or two muons) with large transverse momentum, \(P_{Tl}\).
* Large missing transverse momentum, \(\not{p}_{T}\).
* Two energetic jets in the forward detectors (tagging jets).
* Suppressed hadronic activity between tagging jets.

A sizable contribution from the production of Higgs via gluon-gluon fusion is expected to appear. This note is concerned with the feasibility of the observation of a Higgs signal with a dedicated event selection. Therefore, the contribution from Higgs production via gluon-gluon fusion is considered as a signal processes. The production of this process has been modeled with PYTHIA 6.1.

A number of background are relevant to the channels under consideration:

* \(t\overline{t}\) production. This process yields the largest contribution to the background due to its large cross-section at the LHC and the large branching ratio \({\cal B}(t\to Wb)\). In this process, a pair of \(W\)'s and a pair of \(b\)-jets are produced. The matrix element

calculation in PYTHIA 6.1 has been used to simulate this process. Additionally, the cross-section for the \(t\overline{t}\) production has been scaled up by 20% in order to take into account effects related to the finite width of the top quark [10].
* QCD \(W^{+}W^{-}\)+jets production 2. This is due to QCD emissions to the production of \(W^{+}W^{-}\). The matrix element calculation in PYTHIA 6.1 has been used to simulate this process. Footnote 2: QCD refers to processes mediated by the exchange of quarks and gluons.
* EW \(W^{+}W^{-}\)+jets production 3. These processes come from \(W^{+}W^{-}\) bremsstrahlung in quark-quark, \(q-q\), or quark-antiquark, \(q-\overline{q}\), scattering via \(t\)-channel EW boson exchange. Despite its small cross-section compared with QCD \(W^{+}W^{-}\)+jets production, the contribution of this process is the second largest in the analysis. Like the VBF signal process, the \(W^{+}W^{-}\) production produces little activity in the central area of the detector. A generator from the MadCUP 4 project has been used for this process [11]. Footnote 3: EW refers to processes mediated by the exchange of electro-weak bosons.
* QCD \(Z\)+jets production. The production of \(Z\)+jets is dominated by QCD corrections to the Drell-Yan process \(q\overline{q}\to Z,\gamma^{\star}\to ee,\mu\mu,\tau\tau\). The leptonic decay of \(\tau\)'s is a source of electrons and muons and neutrinos that may be wrongly associated as originating from \(W\)'s. This is relevant to the \(e\mu\) channel. The production of \(Z\)+jets with \(Z\to ee,\mu\mu\) is most relevant for the \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) channels. The \(2\to 2\) matrix elements 5 in PYTHIA 6.1 have been used here. Footnote 4: MadCUP stands for **Madison** Collection of **U**ser **P**rocesses.
* EW \(Z\)+2 jets. The matrix elements for the \(Zjj\) production via charged-current exchange and the \(W^{+}W^{-}\)-fusion have been been used. A generator from the MadCUP project has been used for this process.

For the calculation of the total cross-sections in \(pp\) collisions the CTEQ5L structure function parameterization was used [12]. The impact of initial state radiation (ISR), final state radiation (FSR), fragmentation and hadroniza

PYTHIA 6.1. In the case of the production of \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) the spin correlations have been modeled with the help of the TAUOLA package [13]. In order to simulate the response of the ATLAS detector the ATLFAST package version 00-02-21 has been used [14].

### Pre-selection Cuts for MC Generation

A number of processes considered have a significantly larger cross-section compared to that of the VBF signal process. In order to save disk space, pre-selection cuts have been applied at the generator level for a number of processes. Once the kinematics of the event have been produced by PYTHIA 6.1 the ATLFAST package is called. The detector simulation and reconstruction produced by ATLFAST has been improved by an additional corrections applied to the forward jet tagging efficiency and central jet veto rejection (see Section 3). The following pre-selection is applied:

* Two oppositely charged leptons found in the pseudorapidity range 6\(|\eta|<2.5\) with \(P_{Te}>10,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(P_{T\mu}>5,\mathrm{GeV}\), where \(P_{Te}\) and \(P_{T\mu}\) are the transverse momentum of the electrons and muons, respectively. Footnote 6: Pseudorapidity, \(\eta\), is defined as \(\eta=-\log(\tan\theta/2)\).
* Two tagging jets in opposite hemispheres, with transverse momentum greater than \(1\,5\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and with at least two units of pseudorapidity difference between them.
* Both leptons should lie between the tagging jets (in pseudorapidity).

The processes whose generation includes these pre-selection cuts are: Higgs production via gluon-gluon fusion, \(t\overline{t}\) and QCD \(Z+\)jets production. The results on effective cross-sections after the application of cut **a** only (see Section 4.1) shown in Tables 5, 6 and 7 are affected by this pre-selection.

## 3 Tagging Jets

The topology of the final state produced by the signal is characterized by the presence of two highly energetic forward jets, which are called tagging jets. Because the production of Higgs via VBF is mediated by the exchange in the t-channel of two EW bosons (see Figure 1) it is expected that the production of hadrons in the central region of the detector will be suppressed. This feature makes the topology of the final state of this process distinct from that of the QCD processes, such as the \(t\overline{t}\) production. A number of issues arise when implementing jet reconstruction in this particular analysis: the correction of the energy, the tagging efficiency and the definition of tagging jets.

The jet energy has been corrected with the package ATLFAST-B [14]. This package corrects the \(P_{T}\) of the observed jets to that of the particle. The result of this correction has been tested using real \(Z\) decays with \(Z\to q\overline{q}\). The invariant mass of the corrected jets agrees with the mass of the \(Z\) to better than 1%. This has been tested for light and heavy quarks.

The same test has been performed for Higgs decays \(H\to q\overline{q}\) for masses ranging \(100<M_{H}<200\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The reconstructed invariant mass of the quarks agrees well with the generated \(M_{H}\) for \(M_{H}=115\,\mathrm{GeV}\). However, the corrected invariant mass lies systematically below \(M_{H}\) for larger \(M_{H}\). The reconstructed invariant mass is around 3% too low with respect to the generated \(M_{H}\) for \(M_{H}=200\,\mathrm{GeV}\).

The efficiency of tagging forward jets in the ATLAS detector with a full GEANT simulation in the presence of pileup has been studied [15]. A correction has been calculated to account for detector effects that are not sufficiently well modeled in the ATLFAST simulation. The size of the correction remains within 10% in the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<4.5\). However, the correction is very large for larger pseudorapidities 7.

Footnote 7: The size of the correction applied in signal and background events is illustrated in Figure 6. It should be noted that selection cuts **a** and **b** have been applied (see Section 4.1).

Tagging jets have been defined in [5, 6] as the jets with highest transverse momentum in each hemisphere. Originally in [4] tagging jets had been defined as the two jets with the highest transverse momentum. The distribution of pseudorapidity of the tagging jets for VBF signal events and various simulations of the \(t\overline{t}\) production 8 is shown in the upper left plot of Figure 2. The distinct behavior of the final state of the VBF signal, an EW process, as opposed to \(t\overline{t}\) production, a QCD process, is observed. In \(t\overline{t}\) production, tagging jets tend to peak at small values of pseudorapidity, whereas the tagging jets from the VBF signal tend to be well separated in \(\eta\). The upper right and lower left plots in Figure 2 show the separation in \(\phi\) and \(R\)9.

Footnote 8: In the present note the cross-section for the production of \(t\overline{t}\) has been obtained with the matrix element calculation provided by PYTHIA. Studies are going on to determine the effect of color flow information in the reaction and the more proper simulation of the production of additional real partons in the final state. In a first instance a comparison of the output given by different MC generators based on LO matrix element calculations was performed. Three codes were used. First the matrix element calculation provided by PYTHIA, which is referred to as “tt (Pyth.)”. Secondly, a version of the code recently released within MadCUP referred to as “tt0j (MCUP)”. This code implements detailed information of the color flow in the reaction. However, because PYTHIA6.1 does not consider effects related to the interference between ISR and FSR the angular distributions of additional partons in the final should not be affected by the implementation of this feature. Currently the effect of this feature is being studied in HERWIG, a generator which does consider interference effects between ISR and FSR. Thirdly, an early version of this code which was interfaced to PYTHIA6.1 and ATLFAST by R. S. Harper, is referred to as “tt0j (Harp.)”.

Footnote 9: \(\Delta R\) is defined as \(\sqrt{(\Delta\phi)^{\,2}+(\Delta\eta)^{2}}\).

The results obtained with the definition of tagging jets used in [5, 6] are compared to the one used in [4]. Figure 3 shows the same distributions shown in Figure 2 for signal production for the two different tagging schemes. The lower two plots in Figure 3display peaks at low values of the difference in pseudorapidity between the tagging jets and their invariant mass. With the definition of tagging jets used in [4] it is more probable to find events in which at least one jet coming from ISR/FSR is chosen as a tagging jet. In the final analysis this effect does not lead to a significant loss of signal efficiency. Figure 4 displays the same distributions for \(t\overline{t}\) production as generated by PYTHIA. The dominant contribution to the contamination from \(t\overline{t}\) production comes from the production of \(t\) quarks associated with jets [4]. The definition used in [4] tends to pick up jets which are balanced in transverse momentum and with a small separation in pseudorapidity, as illustrated in the upper right and lower left plots of Figure 4. Figure 5 shows the distributions of the pseudorapidity of the non-tagging jet with the highest \(P_{T}\) for the two definitions of tagging jets.

The definition of tagging jets implemented in [4] is used in the present analysis.

The upper left plot shows the pseudorapidity distributions, where the solid points correspond to the signal, the different lines corresponds to various simulations of \(t\overline{t}\) production. The upper right and lower left plots show the distance in \(\phi\) and in \(\eta\), correspondingly. The lower right plot shows the invariant mass of the two tagging jets.

## 4 Event Selection

The main guidelines for the selection cuts, which provide the best signal significance in the VBF cut based analysis have been defined in [4]. A re-analysis was performed within the ATLAS Higgs working group taking into account relevant additional effects such as ISR, FSR, parton showers, hadronization and more detailed detector effects [5, 6]. The event selection developed in this re-analysis is referred to in this note as the reference event selection. The reference event selection was chosen to be independent of the Higgs mass and was optimized for \(M_{H}\) close to the threshold of \(W^{+}W^{-}\) production.

In Section 4.1 we go through the cuts applied in the reference event selection. A number of kinematic variables are defined which are useful to optimize the event selection for Higgs masses in the range \(115<M_{H}<130\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The cuts obtained in this optimization are shown in Section 4.2.

Figure 3: Same distributions as in Figure 2 are shown for signal production with two definitions of tagging jets. The solid line corresponds to the definition used in [5, 6] and the dashed line to the definition given in [4].

### Reference Event Selection

The cuts that comprise the reference event selection may be found in [5, 6]10. Before the application of the selection cuts specified below, a b-jet veto is applied in the range \(|\eta|<2.5\). The efficiency assumed for tagging \(b\)-jets in this range of pseudorapidity is 60 % with rejection against c-jets and light jets of 10 and 100, respectivelly 11. This requirement is effective in suppressesing the \(t\overline{t}\) background.

Footnote 10: Some additional changes were implemented later on in the reference event selection. These were reported in [16].

Footnote 11: This corresponds to \(NSET=5\) when calling the routine ATLFBJE of the package ATLFAST-B.

The cuts applied in the reference event selection are:

* Two isolated, oppositely charged leptons (one electron and one muon or two electrons or two muons) with \(P_{Tl}>20\) GeV in the central detector region \(|\eta_{l}|<2.5\).

Figure 4: Same as Figure 3 for \(t\overline{t}\) production.

* Two tagging jets, one with transverse momentum, \(P_{Tj_{1}}>40\,\)GeV and the other with \(P_{Tj_{2}}>20\,\)GeV, separated in pseudorapidity by \(|\eta_{j_{1}}-\eta_{j_{2}}|>3.8\). The pseudorapidities of the charged leptons are required to lie between the pseudorapidities of the tagging jets. The pseudorapidity distributions of the tagging jets after applying cuts **a** and these cuts for signal and background events are shown in Figure 6. 
* Charged lepton angular cuts. Separation in \(\phi\) and \(R\) between leptons it is required that \(\Delta\phi_{ll}<1.05\) radians and that \(\Delta R_{ll}<1.8\). For the separation in polar angle between leptons it is required that \(\cos\Delta\theta_{ll}>0.2\). Additionally, we require that \(M_{ll}<85\,\)GeV and that the maximum transverse momentum of the leptons, \(P_{Tl}^{max}<120\,\)GeV. The distributions of some of these kinematic variables after applying cuts **a** and **b** for signal and backgrounds are shown in Figure 7. Similar plots are shown in Figure 8 for signal events for different values of \(M_{H}\). It is observed that the angular correlation between leptons in the laboratory frame becomes stronger for lower values of \(M_{H}\). Because of the large contribution from QCD \(Z\)+jets production with \(Z\to ee,\mu\mu\), in the analysis of the \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) channels we require that \(M_{ll}<75\,\)GeV.
* Tau rejection. A set of cuts was proposed to suppress the contribution from the production of \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) pairs from the decay of the \(Z\) boson [17]. The momentum of the decay products of the \(\tau\)'s, to a good approximation, may be considered in the lab frame as being collinear with the momentum of the \(\tau\)'s. Variables \(x_{\tau

are defined as the energy fraction of the decaying \(\tau\)'s carried by the leptons. By using the conservation of transverse momentum, \(\sum_{i=1,2}P_{T\tau i}=\sum_{i=1,2}P_{Tli}+\not{p}_{T}\). The variables \(x_{\tau 1}\) and \(x_{\tau 2}\) are the solution of two linear equations. The mass of the \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) pair, \(M_{\tau\tau}\), may be computed as \(M_{\tau\tau}=M_{ll}/\sqrt{x_{\tau 1}x_{\tau 2}}\). In the case of the \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) production from decays of real \(Z\)'s the values of \(x_{\tau 1}\) and \(x_{\tau 2}\) lie mainly between 0 and 1, and \(M_{\tau\tau}\) displays a resonant structure. In the case of leptons of the decay of \(W^{+}W^{-}\) pairs, this approximation fails, as illustrated in Figure 9. For illustration purposes, Figure 9 shows the comparison of the correlation of \(x_{\tau 1}\) and \(x_{\tau 2}\) for leptons for the decay \(H\to W^{+}W^{-}\to e^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}\nu\overline{\nu}\) and for \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to e^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}\nu\overline{\nu}\). In the latter case the approximation is a good one. The resolution obtained for \(M_{\tau\tau}\) here is \(\approx 10\,\)GeV, consistent with previous studies [18]. Similar plots are given in Figure 10 for different relevant background processes. Events in which \(x_{\tau 1}>0\), \(x_{\tau 2}>0\) and \(|M_{\tau\tau}-M_{Z}|<25\,\)GeV are rejected.

Figure 6: The plots in the left correspond to the pseudorapidity of tagging jets for signal and various backgrounds after requiring cuts **a** and **b** (see Section 4.1). The plots in the right correspond to the total forward efficiency correction applied.

This cut is very effective against \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) production and changes slightly the signal efficiency, as illustrated in Figures 9 and 10.
* Invariant mass of the two tagging jets, \(M_{jj}\), \(M_{jj}>550\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The distribution of \(M_{jj}\) for signal and background events after the application of cuts **a** and **b** is shown in Figure 11. The distributions of \(M_{jj}\) for signal with different values of \(M_{H}\) shown in Figure 12 indicate a rather weak dependence of \(M_{jj}\) on \(M_{H}\).
* Sum of the transverse momentum vectors of tagging jets, charged leptons and missing momentum: \[\overrightarrow{P}_{T}^{tot}=\sum_{i=1,2}\overrightarrow{P}_{Tji}+\sum_{i=1,2} \overrightarrow{P}_{Tli}+\overrightarrow{P}_{T}^{\overrightarrow{\cdot}}\] (1) This variable is insensitive to extra QCD radiation. The distributions of \(\overrightarrow{P}_{T}^{tot}\) for

The upper left and upper right plots show the distance in \(\phi\) and \(R\) between leptons, respectively. The lower left plot shows the invariant mass of the leptons and the lower right corresponds to the highest transverse momentum of the leptons.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]

In the analysis of the \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) channels it is required that \(\not{p}_{T}>30\,\mbox{GeV}\). This is done to suppress contribution from the large Drell-Yan background.

**i**: Transverse mass, \(M_{T}\). The transverse mass is defined as:

\[M_{T}=\sqrt{\left(E_{T}^{ll}+E_{T}^{\nu\overline{\nu}}\right)^{2}-\left(\overrightarrow {P}_{T}^{ll}+\overrightarrow{\not{p}_{T}}\right)^{2}} \tag{3}\]

where

\[E_{T}^{ll}=\sqrt{\left(\overrightarrow{P}_{T}^{ll}\right)^{2}+M_{ll}^{2}} \tag{4}\]

and

\[E_{T}^{\nu\overline{\nu}}=\sqrt{\left(\overrightarrow{\not{p}_{T}}\right)^{ 2}+M_{ll}^{2}} \tag{5}\]where \(\overrightarrow{P}_{T}^{ll}\) is the total transverse momentum of the two charged leptons. The reconstructed transverse mass in the event is supposed to lie in the mass window, 50 \(<\)_M\({}_{T}\)_\(<\)_M\({}_{H}\)_ + 30 GeV.

### Optimization of Cuts for Higgs Mass \(115<\)_M\({}_{h}\)_\(<\)_ 130 GeV

The selection cuts presented in the previous section are optimized _M\({}_{H}\)_ close to the \(W^{+}W^{-}\) production threshold. Therefore, it is interesting to study the possibility of improving the signal cross-section and the ratio of signal to background for low mass regime (115 \(<\)_M\({}_{H}\)_\(<\) 130 GeV). A number of cuts have been modified to optimize the significance of the signal for the integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\).

In the reference analysis it is required that both charged leptons in the final state

Figure 10: The upper left and upper right and lower left plots correspond to the correlation between \(x_{\tau 1}\) and \(x_{\tau 2}\) for _t\(\overline{t}\)_, EW \(W^{+}W^{-}\)+jets and EW \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\)+jets, respectively. The lower right plot shows the invariant mass of the \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) pair for these processes. Cuts **a** and **b** have been applied.

have transverse momentum of at least \(20\,\mathrm{GeV}\). This requirement significantly reduces the signal efficiency specially for values of \(M_{H}\) around the LEP limit. For this \(M_{H}\) the Higgs decays into two virtual \(W\)'s. The angular separation between the charged leptons becomes smaller with decreasing \(M_{H}\). These features have been taken into account as a benchmark for the optimization. Additionally, the definition of tagging jets used in [4] is implemented.

Cuts **b, d, f, g** and **i** from the reference event selection have remained in the optimized event selection. The following cuts have been modified:

* Transverse momentum of the electrons, \(P_{Te}>15\,\mathrm{GeV}\), and transverse momentum of muons, \(P_{T\mu}>10\,\mathrm{GeV}\).
* Lepton angular cuts, \(\Delta\phi_{ll}<1.5\) and \(\Delta R_{ll}<1.6\) and \(M_{ll}<65\,\mathrm{GeV}\).

Figure 11: Various kinematic distributions of signal and backgrounds after applying cuts **a** and **b**. For the signal \(M_{H}=115\,\mathrm{GeV}\) has been chosen. Shown are the distributions of invariant mass of the tagging jets (upper left), the modulus of the vector of the transverse momentum balance (upper right), the transverse mass of the \(ll\nu\overline{\nu}\) system (lower left) and the modulus of the missing transverse momentum (lower right).

* Invariant mass of the tagging jets, \(600<M_{jj}<2500\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The upper bound significantly reduces the EW \(W^{+}W^{-}+\)jets production.
* Minimum lepton-neutrino transverse mass, \(M_{T}^{ll\nu\overline{\nu}}>20\,\mathrm{GeV}\).

The comparison of the reference and optimized event selections is given in Table 2. Figure 13 shows the transverse mass distributions \(M_{T}\) expected for the channel \(H\to W^{+}W^{-}\to e^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}\not{p}_{T}\). Plots are shown for four different values of \(M_{H}\) and have been normalized to the signal and background cross-sections. The signal and background display different shapes for the transverse mass distribution. The transverse mass is a good discriminating variable, which will help us to increase the discovery potential of the VBF channels. The impact of this feature will be discussed in Section 5.

## 5 Results and Discovery Potential

The present analysis has been performed for the two event selections specified in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. The results in Tables 3-8 are presented in terms of effective cross-sections, _i.e._,cross-sections multiplied by the branching ratios of the corresponding decays and corrected for detector efficiency and acceptance effects.

Tables 3 and 4 display the expected effective cross-sections of Higgs produced via VBF after the application of successive cuts from the reference and optimized event selections, respectively. These tables show results for the three di-lepton channels for four different values of \(M_{H}\) in the range \(115<M_{H}<130\,\mathrm{GeV}\) in steps of \(5\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The improvement in the effective cross-sections ranges between 30% and 85% and varies with the channel and \(M_{H}\). The improvement is largest for the \(\mu\mu\) channel, is smallest for the _ee_ channel and decreases with \(M_{H}\). These effects are due mainly to the decrease

Plots are shown for four different values of \(M_{H}\) and have been normalized according to cross-sections.

of the \(P_{t}\) thresholds on the charged leptons.

Table 5 shows the effective cross-sections for the second signal process considered, Higgs production via gluon-gluon fusion, obtained with the optimized event selection.

Table 6 shows the contribution from the relevant backgrounds obtained for successive cuts within the reference event selection. In Table 6 cuts have been set for the \(e\mu\) channel and \(M_{H}=1\,20\,\mathrm{GeV}\). Similarly, Table 7 shows the results for the optimized event selection. The contribution from \(t\overline{t}\) production increases with respect to the result shown in Table 6, whereas the contribution from EW \(W^{+}W^{-}\)+jets decreases. The latter is mainly due to the change implemented in cut \(\mathbf{e}\).

Table 8 shows the summary of the contribution from different background processes as a function of \(M_{H}\) and the channels considered for the optimized event selection. Overall, the ratio of expected signal to background events increases with the optimized event selection.

The results in terms of number of expected events are given for \(30\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity. Table 9 shows expected number of signal events, \(S\), and number background events, \(B\), for the reference event selection. \(\sigma_{P}\) is the signal significance calculated with Poisson statistics and simple event counting. Details on the definition of \(\sigma_{P}\) and the combination of results from different channels are given in [19]. Results obtained with the optimized event selection are given in Table 10. In the \(M_{H}\) range under study, the improvement of the signal significance introduced by the optimization ranges between \(20\,\mathrm{\%}\) and about \(30\%\) and decreases with \(M_{H}\). This improvement is illustrated in Table 11 and Figure 14.

In Table 10 the values of signal significance are also given in terms of \(\sigma_{L}\): the result obtained by implementing likelihood ratios in the calculation of confidence levels 12. Details on this calculation may be found in [19]. For this result \(M_{T}\) has been used as a discriminating variable (see Figure 13).

the final analysis. This feature helps us increase the signal significance with respect to the optimized cut analysis by an additional \(10-15\,\%\). This improvement decreases slowly with \(M_{H}\). Combining all channels results in a signal significance of \(\sim 4.5\,\sigma\) for \(M_{H}\) = \(120\,\)GeV.

With respect to the results obtained with the reference analysis the improvement after the optimization of cuts and the implementation of likelihood ratios in the calculation of confidence levels ranges between \(30\,\%\) and \(50\,\%\). This improvement is illustrated in Table 11 and Figure 14. The sensitivity for the discovery of a SM Higgs boson is illustrated in Figure 15.

Tables for the Scientific Note

A number of selection cuts have been modified in order to match the event selection cuts adopted by ATLAS for the Scientific Note [20]. These are:

* Define tagging jets as the highest \(P_{T}\) jet in each hemisphere.
* Tagging efficiency of b-jets has been set to 70% with mistag efficiency of 25% for c-quarks and 4% for light quarks and gluon jets.
* Sliding \(M_{T}\) window, \(50<M_{T}<M_{H}+10\,\mathrm{GeV}\).

As pointed out in Section 2.2, a number of pre-selection cuts were applied when generating MC samples for Higgs production via gluon-gluon fusion, \(t\overline{t}\) and QCD \(Z+\)jets production. Here a different definition of tagging jets has been used [20]. The effect of this inconsistency was studied by comparing results obtained with the MC samples generated by us with pre-selection cuts and smaller samples generated by the Higgs working group without pre-selection cuts [21]. In the case of MC samples for Higgs production via gluon-gluon fusion dedicated samples were generated by us. It was observed that the effective cross-sections for Higgs production via gluon-gluon fusion and QCD \(Z+\)jets production after applying all cuts do not seem to depend on the choice of the definition of tag jets. This is not the case for \(t\overline{t}\) production. The rejection efficiency for \(t\overline{t}\) production obtained with the definition of tagging jets used here is lower than in the case of the one used in Section 4.1. The difference in the rejection efficiency between the two definitions of tagging jets decreases rapidly with increasing the b-jet tagging efficiency. For the b-jet tagging efficiency chosen here this effect is of the order of 5%.

In this Appendix results are produced for the optimized event selection (see Section 4.1). Similar tables shown in Section 5 are given here (see Tables 12 - 20).

Table 12 shows the effective cross-sections for VBF signal for the event selection used here for different channels as a function of \(M_{H}\). In previous sections the contribution to signal processes from leptonic decays of \(\tau\)'s of the decay of the \(W\)'s in the final state were not taken into account. This contribution is added here. The effect of the inclusion of leptonic \(\tau\) decays for the three channels and different cuts and \(M_{H}=120\,\mathrm{GeV}\) is illustrated in Table 13. Table 14 displays the increase of the signal due to the inclusion of leptonic \(\tau\) decays after the application of all cuts as a function of \(M_{H}\). The increase ranges between 15% and 40% and it grows with \(M_{H}\).

Table 15 shows the effective cross-sections from signal coming from gluon-gluon fusion for the three channels and different cuts for \(M_{H}=1\,20\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The effect of the inclusion of leptonic \(\tau\) decays is illustrated in Table 16 for \(M_{H}=120\,\mathrm{GeV}\).

The MC samples for \(t\overline{t}\) used here correspond to those available in [21]. The values of the effective cross-sections for QCD \(Z+\)jets production after cuts **a** through **g** given in Table 17 were calculated using the MC samples available in [21]. Because of the lack of statistics the results obtained for this process after all cuts were not calculated with these samples. Instead, the MC samples generated with the pre-selection cuts were used. The contribution from all background processes after all cuts with the event selection used in the present Appendix is given in Table 18.

The inclusion of leptonic \(\tau\) decays leads to an increase of the effective cross-section by \(20-25\%\), depending on the cut. The contribution from \(t\overline{t}\) and EW \(W^{+}W^{-}\)+jets reported in Tables 17 and 18 include the effect of the \(\tau\) leptonic decays. This is not the case for the the effective cross-sections for the contribution of EW \(W^{+}W^{-}\)+jets. This effect could not be studied with the present MC set. In order to estimate this effect a sample of QCD \(W^{+}W^{-}\)+jets without \(\tau\)'s was generated. The inclusion of the leptonic \(\tau\) decays increases the effective cross-section of QCD \(W^{+}W^{-}\)+jets by some \(13\%\). The effective cross-sections of EW \(W^{+}W^{-}\)+jets are scaled up by \(13\%\). This is included in the final results reported in Tables 19 and 20. Table 20 shows the final results obtained by scaling up the effective cross-section by a factor of 2.1. This is due to the uncertainty in the estimation of the background [5].

It should be noted that the combined significance for \(M_{H}=130\,\)GeV reported in Tables 19 and 20 have been obtained by adding up in quadrature the Poissonian significances of the three channels.

The distribution of the transverse mass for \(M_{H}=120\,\)GeV and the channel after all cuts in the event selection used in this Appendix is shown in Figure 16. The accepted cross-section is shown in \(M_{T}\) bins of \(10\,\)GeV for signal and background. The left plot corresponds to the nominal analysis which results are shown in Table 19. The plot in the right is obtained after multiplying the contribution from \(t\overline{t}\) by 2.1.

The sensitivity for the discovery of a SM Higgs boson is illustrated in Figure 17 for the two estimations of the background.

Table 20: Same as Table 19 after multiplying the contribution from \(t\overline{t}\) background by a factor of 2.1 (see text).

Figure 17: Sensitivity for the discovery of a SM Higgs boson obtained with the optimized event selection as a function of the Higgs mass. The significance is calculated with Poisson statistics and simple event counting. The upper curve corresponds to the results of the nominal event selection and MC set and reported in Table 19. The lower line corresponds to the significance obtained by multiplying the contribution from \(t\overline{t}\) background by a factor of 2.1 and reported in Table 20.
