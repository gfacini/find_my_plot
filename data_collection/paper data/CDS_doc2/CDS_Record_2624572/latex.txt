# Review of ATLAS Open Data 8 TeV datasets, tools and activities

The ATLAS Collaboration

The ATLAS Collaboration

The ATLAS Collaboration has released two 8 TeV datasets and relevant simulated samples to the public for educational use. A number of groups within ATLAS have used these ATLAS Open Data 8 TeV datasets, developing tools and educational material to promote particle physics. The general aim of these activities is to provide simple and user-friendly interactive interfaces to simulate the procedures used by high-energy physics researchers.

International Masterclasses introduce particle physics to high school students and have been studying 8 TeV ATLAS Open Data since 2015. Inspired by this success, a new ATLAS Open Data initiative was launched in 2016 for university students. A comprehensive educational platform was thus developed featuring a second 8 TeV dataset and a new set of educational tools.

ATLAS Open Data 8 TeV datasets and associated tools as well as a selection of activities studying these datasets are presented and discussed.

## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS Data Access Policy [1] sets out guidelines regarding open access to ATLAS data by non-ATLAS members. It was endorsed by the ATLAS Collaboration Board in June 2014. It states: 'The main objective is to make the data available in a usable way to people external to the ATLAS collaboration. [...] ATLAS recognises the vital role of outreach and education, and participates in and encourages outreach and education activities, and makes selected data available for them.'

The ATLAS Collaboration [2] has since released two 8 \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) datasets, 2 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) in XML format and 1 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) in ROOT [3] ntuple format. Both datasets were recorded in 2012. The former was released in 2015 to be used for the well-established International Masterclass activities for high school students. The latter was released in 2016, with various tools, on an educational platform aimed at undergraduate physics students.

All 8 \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) datasets, tools, software and documentation for studying the 8 \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) datasets, including the educational platform, are collectively known as 8 \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) ATLAS Open Data. The 8 \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) ATLAS Open Data are presented and discussed here, as well as a selection of activities studying the datasets.

## 2 Overview of the aims, objectives and target audiences

The aim of ATLAS Open Data is to provide data and tools to high school, masters and undergraduate students, to help educate them in physics analysis techniques used in experimental particle physics. Sharing data collected by the ATLAS experiment aims to generate excitement and enthusiasm for fundamental research, inspiring physicists of the future.

International Masterclasses, which are described in Section 6.1, introduce particle physics to high school students and have been running very successfully for the last 20 years. ATLAS data were first used in 2011 [4], and 8 \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) ATLAS Open Data in 2015.

Inspired by the success of International Masterclasses, a new ATLAS Open Data initiative was launched in 2016. The target audience is physics undergraduate and masters students, but may also include advanced high school students or indeed anyone with some basic understanding of particle physics and coding experience. A comprehensive educational platform was developed featuring a new 8 \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) dataset and a set of educational tools at a more advanced level. The objectives of this initiative are to provide:

* 8 \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) proton-proton data collected by ATLAS plus associated simulated data.
* Tools and software of varying technical difficulty to analyse the data.
* An educational platform providing easy access to the data, software and tools with documentation in the form of step-by-step instructions for users.

## 3 Overview of ATLAS Open Data 8 TeV datasets

The ATLAS Collaboration has released two 8 TeV datasets, 2 fb\({}^{-1}\) in XML format and 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) in ROOT ntuple format. They are both available to the public and so are referred to as open data. The former will be called the 8 TeV ATLAS Open Data masterclass dataset, the latter the ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset. Both datasets were recorded in 2012, but produced in independent and unrelated processes, at different times, using different selection criteria.

The 8 TeV ATLAS Open Data masterclass dataset contains 26000 events. The ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset contains nearly 15 million events, thus allowing for more in-depth studies.

Another important difference between the two datasets is that the ATLAS Open Data masterclass dataset is rigorously selected for one particular analysis, such as Higgs \(\to ZZ\), whereas the ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset is multi-purpose allowing for various analyses.

All the 8 TeV datasets, the tools, software and documentation for studying the 8 TeV datasets, including the educational platform, are collectively known as 8 TeV ATLAS Open Data.

### ATLAS Open Data masterclass dataset

There are two International Masterclass activities using ATLAS data:

* The \(W\)-path [5] studies the \(W\) boson, using ATLAS 7 TeV data recorded in 2011 and 2012.
* The \(Z\)-path [6] studies the \(Z\) boson, using ATLAS 8 TeV data recorded in 2012.

The \(W\)-path uses ATLAS 7 TeV data so will not be discussed further in this note.

The 8 TeV ATLAS Open Data masterclass dataset consists of 26 datasets in XML format comprising 26000 events. There are 267 variables available in the XML files. The XML files are produced by a dedicated interface called JiveXML running within the ATLAS Athena framework [7]. Athena is a concrete realisation of a component-based architecture which was designed for a wide range of physics data-processing applications.

### ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset

The ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset consists of proton-proton collisions collected by ATLAS with an integrated luminosity of \(1.00\pm 0.02\) fb\({}^{-1}\)[8] plus relevant simulated data. The data were recorded in 2012 and made available to the public in 2016 in a simplified data format.

Events from fourteen runs were selected, namely runs 207490, 207532, 207582, 207589, 207749, 207772, 207845, 207865, 207934, 207982, 208126, 208184, 208189, and 208258. All runs belong to period D of the 2012 data taking.

Event selection was carried out, reducing the size and information content of the standard data format used in ATLAS, enabling faster event processing. The final dataset fits onto a typical hard disk drive, easing storage issues. The resulting format is a TTree tuple (or ROOT ntuple) with 45 branches as detailed in Table 1.

The layout is optimised towards simplicity to reduce the complexities encountered in a full-scale analysis, emphasising the educational character of the dataset.

\end{table}
Table 1: Description of the ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset variables. ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (\(r\),\(\phi\)) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the \(z\)-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta\) =-ln tan(\(\theta\)/2).

The event selection involved:

* Corrupted event protection. Events corrupted due to detector problems happening for short periods (less than 1 minute) were individually removed. This affected less than 0.1% of events.
* Single-lepton trigger satisfied (where the lepton is an electron or muon), with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold of 5.
* Veto on events containing bad jets. Bad jets are jets not associated to energy deposits in the calorimeters. They arise from various sources, including LHC beam conditions and cosmic-ray showers.
* Primary vertex requirement of at least one primary vertex with at least four tracks.
* At least one lepton passing a 25  threshold.

Event reduction resulting from the preselection is summarised in Table 2.

ATLAS Open Data 2016 contains two data files; one where the presence of an electron triggered the event recording (called the 'gamma dataset') and the other where a muon triggered the event recording ('muon dataset'). The data are accompanied by relevant simulated data:

* ATLAS Open Data 2016 gamma dataset containing \(\sim\)8 million events.
* ATLAS Open Data 2016 muon dataset containing \(\sim\)7 million events.
* ATLAS simulated data consisting of 42 datasets containing \(\sim\)45 million events.

Overlap removal was applied to ensure that the same event does not exist in both the egamma and muon datasets. The previous means that electron-triggered events may contain a muon with high transverse momentum, for that reason the muon dataset has a veto on such events.

The use of the ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset in simple but realistic physics analyses shows that the agreement between data and simulated data is good and certainly sufficient given the limited statistics of this educational dataset. For further details regarding the ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset see [8].

\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} Data & \(N_{\mathrm{Events}}^{\mathrm{total}}\) & \(N_{\mathrm{Events}}^{\mathrm{preselected}}\) & \(\mathcal{L}\) [pb\({}^{-1}\)] & Total size/Mb \\ \hline egamma dataset & 33575219 & 7917590 & 1000.6 & 750 \\ muon dataset & 33815203 & 7028084 & 1000.6 & 620 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 4 Overview of ATLAS Open Data tools

### Tools using the 8 TeV ATLAS Open Data masterclass dataset

#### 4.1.1 HYbrid Pupil's Analysis Tool for Interactions in ATLAS (HYPATIA)

HYPATIA is an event analysis tool to study ATLAS data for educational purposes and is used by both high school and university students. HYPATIA has been developed at the University of Athens [9] and is currently available in two different versions.

Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the off-line version of HYPATIA. This off-line version [10] is based on the ATLANTIS [11], a graphics package which displays the trajectories of particles produced by proton-proton collisions in the ATLAS detector. Tracks are displayed together with their signature in the different sub-detectors: the inner tracking detectors, the calorimeters and the outer muon spectrometer. On top of the ATLANTIS functionalities, the off-line version of HYPATIA adds significant functionality to the platform. This is mainly used in the International Masterclasses [12] as part of the \(Z\)-path activity. The students use HYPATIA to browse through real data looking for \(J/\psi\), \(\Upsilon\), \(Z\), Higgs boson decays and some hypothetical particles. They study the tracks in different parts of the detector, identify different leptons and finally insert the corresponding decay tracks into the invariant-mass window to reconstruct the mass of the particles they are trying to 'discover'. This is a simplified simulation of the work being done by particle physics researchers. It aims to give the students a basic understanding of particle physics beyond what they learn at school and an insight into what researchers do, in order to attract their interest towards physics and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). The \(Z\)-path exercise is used by more than 4000 students each year in more than 30 countries worldwide.

HYPATIA has been used by an impressive number of students, with more than 500 sessions having been run in high schools and 50 at university level.

#### 4.1.2 ATLAS Tracer

ATLAS Tracer [13] is a 3D web application for visualisation of the ATLAS detector and physics events.

It is designed to be used in outreach and educational programmes, to let users learn about particle physics detectors and to explore simplified event data. The latest web technologies are used enabling a CAD like application in a browser. No installation is needed and the application is platform (hardware/software) independent.

ATLAS Tracer is under development by a team at the Georgian Technical University [14]. The full ATLAS detector geometry is described by Geant4 [15]. ATLAS Tracer uses a simplified detector model, to describe the large and complex detector systems with minimum memory consumption.

As shown in Figure 2, ATLAS Tracer can visualise tracks and jets and allows to explore events through zooming, rotating and moving the event/display. It allows to 'cut-out' parts of the detector material to get a clearer view of the of the event reconstruction.

Currently ATLAS Tracer uses the ATLAS Open Data masterclass dataset, which is in XML format.

### Tools using the ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset

The ATLAS Open Data educational platform was developed to feature the ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset. A set of analysis tools were developed to accompany the data on the educational platform:

* Histogram Analyser offers an interactive online visualisation of a simple cut-based analysis.
* ROOTbrowser allows online investigation of all the data ntuple variables.
* ATLAS Open Data ROOTbooks provide web based analyses which are easy to run, edit and save.
* ATLAS Open Data Software implements the protocols needed for reading the data files, writing out histograms and plotting results, forming the basis for more involved analysis exercises.
* ATLAS Open Data Virtual Machines bundle the ATLAS Open Data Software and ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset to run predefined physics analyses.
* Documentation gives step-by-step instructions for users
* A web-based version of HYPATIA was developed to manage event samples of smaller sizes with a simpler format, allowing several thousands of events to be analysed.

These analysis tools will be described in more detail in the following.

#### 4.2.1 Histogram Analyser

A web based tool for fast, cut-based analysis of data and visualisation of the data using interactive histograms.

Four processes are displayed in Histogram Analyser; the Higgs \(\to WW\) signal and three main background processes: di-boson production (\(WW\)), top-pair production (\(t\bar{t}\)) and single \(Z\)-boson production (\(Z\)). Each process is represented by a different colour. Histograms of eight key variables are displayed.

Two flavours of Histogram Analyser applications are available:

* Higgs \(\to WW\) simulated data. As you can appreciated in Figure 3, it displays the full set of simulated data. Three different leptonic channels are available; electron-electron, muon-muon and electron-muon. This simulated data includes 17 Higgs \(\to WW\) events, overwhelmed by 611276 \(Z\) background events.
* Higgs \(\to WW\) simulated and real data. As you can appreciated in Figure 4, it displays data and simulated data for just the electron-muon channel. In this reduced data sample, 8 Higgs \(\to WW\) simulated events are available.

The cursor can be used to apply selections to a particular variable. The effect on the other variables is immediately reflected in the remaining histograms. This tool shows how physicists differentiate between physics processes. The signatures of different physics processes can look very different from one another. By applying selection criteria to data, the simulated Higgs signal can be isolated from the background processes.

The Histogram Analyser applications show the data and the relationship between the signal and background processes. They can therefore simplify and speed-up the optimisation of selections, before coding an analysis.

A very useful feature of the Histogram Analyser applications is the histogram displaying the number of events per 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) for the signal and each of the three background processes. The significance of the Higgs \(\to WW\) signal is calculated (the ratio of the number of Higgs events to the square root of the number of background events) and displayed. This allows the user to see very clearly whether the selections they have put in place are doing a good job of extracting the signal.

Figure 3: Histogram Analyser: Higgs \(\to WW\) using simulated data. The signal plus the three main background processes, \(WW,t\bar{t}\) and \(Z\) are displayed, using the full simulated ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset.

#### 4.2.2 ATLAS Open Data Analysis Software

To allow for a more in-depth analysis of the ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset a software framework, referred to as ATLAS Open Data Software, was created. It was written in Python interfaced to ROOT and is publicly available on Github [16]. It contains a set of tools an features that make it more powerful than Histogram Analyser, since it gives more flexibility to study and present the data. The software reads the data files, writes out histograms and plots results. Ease of use and clear structure were considered as the key factors when writing the code, with an emphasis on the educational nature of the exercise. Seven example analyses are provided and are intended to be starting points for further development.

The seven analyses are:

* Three high-statistics Standard Model analyses: a \(W\) boson decaying to leptons, a \(Z\) boson decaying to a lepton pair, and a selection of top quark pairs resulting in a final state with a lepton, a neutrino and four jets. Each of these analyses have sufficiently high event yields to study the processes in detail.

Figure 4: Histogram Analyser: Higgs \(\to WW\to ev\mu\nu\) using data and simulated data. The expected contributions from signal plus the three main background processes, \(WW,t\bar{t}\) and \(Z\) are displayed. Data (black dots) and simulated data (color-bars) are displayed for just the electron–muon channel. The error (black) bars correspond to the statistical uncertainty.

* Three low-statistics Standard Model analyses: \(WZ\), \(ZZ\), and a Higgs \(\to WW\) analysis. Analyses for these processes, with lower production cross sections, are used to illustrate the statistical limitations of the dataset. Only leptonic decay modes are considered.
* A beyond the Standard Model (BSM) analysis: multiple samples of simulated data containing \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) signal events are provided to implement a simplified analysis for searching for new physics.

Each of the seven data analyses imposes different selection criteria on the events. See Table 3 for the selection criteria applied in the six Standard Model analyses.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c} Cuts applied to each analysis & \(W\) & \(Z\) & \(tt\) & \(WZ\) & \(ZZ\) & \(H\to WW\) \\ \hline Single lepton trigger satisfied & \(\times\) & \(\times\) & \(\times\) & \(\times\) & \(\times\) \\ Event in data passes GRL & \(\times\) & \(\times\) & \(\times\) & \(\times\) & \(\times\) \\ Event has good vertex (N\({}_{\text{tracks}}\) \(>\) 4) & \(\times\) & \(\times\) & \(\times\) & \(\times\) & \(\times\) \\ Number good leptons with \(p_{\text{T}}\) \(>\) 25 GeV & 1 & 2 & 1 & 3 & 1 & 2 \\
4 good leptons with \(p_{\text{T}}\) \(>\) 10 GeV & & & & & \(\times\) & \\ \(E_{T}^{miss}\) \(>\) 30 GeV & \(\times\) & \(\times\) & & & & \\ Transverse Mass \(>\) 30 GeV & \(\times\) & \(\times\) & & & & \\ Leptons same flavour & & \(\times\) & & \(\times\) & & \\ Leptons opposite charge & & \(\times\) & & \(\times\) & \(\times\) & \\ \(|m_{ll}-m_{Z}|<\) 20 GeV & & \(\times\) & & & & \\ \(|m_{ll}-m_{Z}|<\) 10 GeV & & & \(\times\) & & & \\ At least four good jets & & \(\times\) & & & & \\ At least two b-tagged jets & & \(\times\) & & & & \\ No jets \(p_{\text{T}}\) \(>\) 25 GeV & & & & & \(\times\) \\ \(p_{\text{T},\ell\ell}>\) 30 GeV & & & & & \(\times\) \\ \(\Delta\phi(\ell\ell,E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}})>\pi/2\) & & & & \(\times\) & \\ \(m_{\ell\ell}<\) 55 GeV & & & & \(\times\) & \\ \(\Delta\phi(\ell\ell)<\) 1.8 radians & & & & \(\times\) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: ATLAS Open Data Software: Selection criteria applied in the six Standard Model analyses.

Once the analysis code is downloaded, the main directory 'ATLAS-DataAndTools' contains two Python scripts and six folders. The folders are:

* Analysis: contains the analysis code for the seven analyses.
* Configurations: contains the configuration files for running the analysis code and plotting.
* Input: the data and simulated data files are here.
* results: the initial histograms are written here after running an analysis, which are then used for plotting.
* Plotting: contains files defining key features of the plots.
* Output: the final plots are written here.

RunScript.py and PlotResults.py are the two scripts required to run an analysis. RunScript.py produces histograms of individual variables. The histograms are written to the Results folder. See Figure 5 (left) for an example histogram. PlotResults.py scales the histograms, colours them in and stacks them to produce final plots representing all the data and their comparison with simulated data. These plots are written to the Output folder. See Figure 5 (right) for an example plot.

Figure 5: ATLAS Open Data Software: Running the software with RunScript.py produces histograms of individual variables. Running PlotResults.py then scales the histograms, colours them in and stacks them to produce the final plots. As an example, the jet transverse momentum histogram (left) and final plot showing data and simulated data (right).

#### 4.2.3 Analysis Browser

An interactive physics analysis is available, the top-quark-pair analysis. The selection criteria for the top quark pair analysis are detailed and interactive plots displayed. The plots are produced from running the top quark pair analysis in the ATLAS Open Data Software. These interactive plots can be inspected, to learn more about the data points, they can also be zoomed into and the axis scales changed. Figure 6 is a screenshot of the Analysis Browser.

The analysis software developed at CERN, ROOT, is widely used in High Energy Physics research. It is a modular scientific software framework which provides all the functionalities needed to deal with big data processing, statistical analysis, visualisation and storage. It is mainly written in C++ [17] but integrated with other languages such as Python [18]. The ROOT Browser is a web-based tool for the more advanced user. It is often used to inspect datasets and to help understand the data before writing analysis code.

The ROOT Browser tool can be used in the Analysis Browser section on the ATLAS Open Data educational platform. A number of ROOT ntuples are available to be inspected. These ntuples have been produced from running the top-pair analysis in ATLAS Open Data Software, as described in Section 4.2.2.

Distributions can be displayed and selections imposed by using the cursor. One or more files can be loaded. See Figure 7 for a look of the ROOT Browser in action.

#### 4.2.4 ATLAS Open Data ROOTbooks

Jupyter [19] Notebook technology allows data analysis to be performed directly with only a web browser. The ROOT framework has been integrated into Jupyter Notebook technology such that ROOT commands can be executed on a Jupyter Notebook. This combination is called a ROOTbook. ROOTbooks are an interactive computing environment, presenting a playground where users can write, run and save their own code.

Physics analyses in the form of ROOTbooks are to be made available on the ATLAS Open Data educational platform using SWAN [20] and Binder [21]. SWAN (Service for Web based ANalysis) is a platform to perform interactive data analysis in the cloud. The user code, executions and data live entirely in the cloud. Binder is a public service to render and run Jupyter notebooks hosted in repositories accessible online. It can be used to perform live testing of ideas, like new selections in the data to analyse, or even enhanced documentation using HTML and CSS. ROOTbooks, therefore, will avoid local installations by using notebooks in a Software as a Service environment on a computer or in the cloud.

Educational and training material will be created that is easy to use and share. The same seven analyses as described in ATLAS Open Data Software, in Section 4.2.2, will be available as interactive ROOTbooks. They are currently work in progress, and some examples are available in the ATLAS Open Data web platform for testing. For further details see Ref. [22]. The material under creation is a set of ROOTbooks and complementary documentation to teach concepts of particle physics, data analysis, computing and statistics. See Figure 8 for first page of the planned \(W\)-boson analysis ROOTbook. HTML capabilities will allow rich in-situ documentation.

#### 4.2.5 ATLAS Open Data Virtual Machines

A Virtual Machine (VM) allows for an unmodified operating system with all of its installed software to run in a special environment, on top of another operating system. A physical computer is the 'host', while the virtual machine is the 'guest'. Most of the guest code runs unmodified, directly on the host computer, and the guest operating system behaves as if it is running on a real machine.

ATLAS Open Data Virtual Machines are offered to study the ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset, since they remove the need to download and install various packages. Everything that is needed is included.

Five different VMs are being prepared. They include software to carry out physics analysis using the ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset. The VMs can run on essentially any common operating system. The VMs range in size, to suit all types of users. The five VMs are detailed in Table 4.

The large VM, or **VM-L**, contains the latest version of Scientific Linux [23] and ROOT [24], plus all the ATLAS Open Data Software and the complete ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset.

The medium VM, or **VM-M**, is essentially the large VM but without data.

The small VM, or **VM-S**, hosts the minimal necessary software to run the ATLAS Open Data analysis code. It comes with just 10% of the data to reduce download time, allowing a user to setup and run the analyses quickly. A script is included, to download the full dataset. Lubuntu [25] is used in this case, since it is smaller in size than Scientific Linux OS 6.7. However Lubuntu comes with ROOT v5 which does not allow running of the ROOT notebooks.

The **VM-N** is even smaller but needs internet access to work since it uses the CernVM File System (CVMFS [26]). The user can access all the common scientific software for the physics experiments curated by the CERN SFT group [27]. The advantage is that the latest stable ROOT version is readily available.

The smallest VM, **VM-\(\mu\)**, is work in progress. The proposal is for it to be much smaller than **VM-N**. It is intended for expert users, who are used to working remotely e.g. on LXPLUS (LinuX Public Login User Service) the interactive logon service to Linux for all CERN users. It will not have a graphical interface, so will essentially be a black and white terminal where the analyses can be run.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l} Size & Name & Size (GB) & ROOT version & Operating System & Data (fb\({}^{-1}\)) \\ \hline Large & VM-L & 10.6 : 22 & 6-07-06 & Scientific Linux 6.7 & 1.0 \\ Medium & VM-M & 4.6 : 11 & 6-07-06 & Scientific Linux 6.7 & 0 \\ Small & VM-S & 2 : 2.13 & 5-34-14 & Lubuntu 16.04 & 0.1 \\ Net & VM-N & 5.2 : 17 & latest & Scientific Linux 6.7 & 1.0 \\ Micro & VM-\(\mu\) & work in progress & 6 & Scientific Linux & 1.0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 6 Conclusion

Figure 7: ROOT Browser: Ntuples produced from running the top-pair analysis can be inspected using ROOT Browser.

We now want to see our results. At first we will create a canvas, the entity which in ROOT holds graphics primitives. Then we draw the histogram on the canvas and after that the canvas on which the histogram lies. Once the histogram is created you can zoom in and out because it is interactive.

#### 4.2.6 Documentation

The ATLAS Open Data educational platform is divided into three sections: 'Get Started', 'Web Analysis' and 'Data & Tools'. The documentation mimics this structure. GitBook [28] was chosen for the written documentation since it is a medium that works both on and offline. The documentation consists of GitBooks, which give step-by-step explanations, as well as short videos hosted on YouTube [29] which show the user what to expect if they follow the steps in the documentation.

The documentation is primarily targeted at undergraduate physics students, so assumes some physics knowledge and computing experience. However the instructions are intended to be simple to follow, with many links for further reading.

The 'Get Started' book begins by describing the Higgs Boson, how it is produced and how it decays, according to the Standard Model predictions. To help explain how Higgs Bosons are searched for in ATLAS, terminology such as event, primary vertex and simulated data is explained. The visualisation tool, Histogram Analyser, is then presented, explaining how the Higgs signal and three background processes are represented. An exercise follows suggesting variable selections that can be made, motivated by real Higgs physics analyses, to separate the Higgs events from those coming from other Standard Model events like the \(WW\)-bosons or \(Z\)-boson events. The selection criteria are shown in Figure 9. See Figure 10 for the results of the selection seen in Histogram Analyser. The ROOT Browser visualisation tool is then presented, explaining how to query the data files. To complete the 'Get Started' book, a glossary is available. This is not intended to be an exhaustive glossary, but provides a starting point in understanding the physics and the ATLAS detector.

The 'Web Analysis' section of the educational platform is still under development and so, as of now, there is no documentation.

Data & Tools has two GitBooks. The main documentation for this section is the 'Software' book. As in the 'Get Started' book, an introduction to the relevant physics is given. The seven available analyses that study the following processes are explained: \(W\) boson, \(Z\) boson, \(t\bar{t}\), \(WZ\), \(ZZ\), \(H\to WW\) and \(Z^{\prime}\). Instructions are then given on how to set up a Virtual Machine and how to run one of the analyses. Various plots are produced, after running an analysis. The key plots are explained, including a discussion comparing data and simulated data. The code is explained in more detail, along with code snippets and links to the software in the GitHub repository. To complete this book, event selection for each analysis is listed, variable names inside the datasets are defined and a glossary helps explain some of the terminology used. See Figure 11 and Figure 12 for examples of documentation in the 'Software' book.

The 'Data & Tools' documentation includes two videos, 'Setup your environment' and 'Take a look at the data'. Both videos follow the steps explained in the GitBook chapter of the same name, to give the user a feel for the different steps and a visual display of what to expect.

The second book in the 'Data & Tools' section, the 'Virtual Machine' book, focuses on the technical issues of setting up one of the ATLAS Open Data Virtual Machines. This involves downloading, installing and preparing VirtualBox [30], then downloading and adding the Virtual Machine. This book is intended for people who know what they want to do, and simply need the technical advice on the specific ATLAS Open Data Virtual Machines.

The documentation is an introduction to particle physics and the ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset. Example exercises are given, with suggestions on how to modify and extend the code. The user is encouraged to continue to modify the code as desired. Likewise, collaborators are open to develop exercises using the existing framework.

Figure 9: Documentation: The ’Get Started’ book describes selection criteria inspired by a real Higgs analysis, encouraging users to make selections using the Histogram Analyser.

Figure 10: Documentation: The ’Get Started’ book describes selection criteria inspired by a real Higgs analysis, encouraging users to make selections using the Histogram Analyser. The results of the selections are shown here. Three Higgs events are extracted from the background, with a significance of 0.277.

#### 4.2.7 HYPATIA online

The need to easily manage event samples of smaller sizes with a simpler format led to the development of the online version of HYPATIA [31]. This does not require the download or installation of any software or event files and can be used on any device including mobile phones and tablets. The online version of HYPATIA uses a simplified interface that retains all the necessary functionality for the International Masterclasses and adds new functionality for additional exercises.

One of the new functionalities takes the user to participate in an exercise using similar computational infrastructure like that one used by the researcher. Students use batches of several thousand events (data and simulated signal and background data), and instead of looking at them individually, they optimise a series of parameters which are used to select the desired events automatically. Their goal is to improve the signal-to-background ratio to make discoveries while retaining a high efficiency for the signal. Figure 13 shows a screenshot of the online version of HYPATIA. Figure 14 shows a 'batch event' analysis window for Higgs decaying to four leptons.

The 'batch event' samples are produced from running over the Open Data 2016 dataset, selecting just lepton information. These samples corresponds to 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data.

## 5 Access Points to ATLAS Open Data resources

At the ATLAS Open Data project, one of the key objectives is to make the resources available to as many people as possible around the World. To try to accomplish with that aim, the data, tools, tutorials and documentation can all be accessed using the following web-based and offline platforms:

* ATLAS Open Data educational platform.
* CERN Open Data Portal.
* ATLAS Open Data Key.

### ATLAS Open Data educational platform

The ATLAS Open Data educational platform [32] provides access to the ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset, described in Section 3.2, and associated tools described in Section 4.2. These are accompanied with documentation, as described in Section 4.2.6, that explains the data and how to use the tools. See Figure 15 for a screenshot of the educational platform.

The video on the homepage starts with a view of the world which zooms into CERN where particles are colliding in the centre of ATLAS. In this way, the idea of data being collected and represented in histograms is introduced. The user is then guided through how to visualise the data, how to download and use the data, and how to run open-source software 'for you to make your own discoveries'.

The ATLAS Open Data educational platform is divided into three sections: 'Get Started', 'Web Analysis' and 'Data & Tools'. Each section has a page with a description of the section and a video detailing what is available in that section. See Figure 16 for a screenshot of the 'Data & Tools' section. Links are available on the educational platform for the tools and documentation as well as to social media, feedback surveys and a public forum to post questions.

Figure 15: Screenshot of the ATLAS Open Data educational platform website.

The Get Started section includes data visualisation tools which enable the study of the data in a browser; Histogram Analyser, as described in Section 4.2.1, an interactive physics analysis and ROOTbrowser, as described in Section 4.2.3. These tools provide easy access to the data, without requiring much knowledge or effort by the user.

The 'Web Analysis' section will provide online ROOTbooks, as described in Section 4.2.4, and documentation, but these are currently work in progress.

The 'Data & Tools' section provides links to the documentation, datasets, ATLAS Open Data Software and Virtual Machines. The ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset, as described in Section 3.2, can be downloaded either separately or in bulk. The ATLAS Open Data Software, as described in Section 4.2.2, is available on GitHub or directly as a zip file for download. The ATLAS Open Data Virtual Machines, as described in Section 4.2.5, are available for download. GitHub and videos provide step-by-step instructions, on how to set up a VM, download the data and run the software locally.

The ATLAS Open Data educational platform was launched in July 2016. Since then it has been promoted in ATLAS meetings, at various conferences, on Facebook and Twitter, to increase awareness and encourage more users. Figure 17 shows tweets and Figure 18 an infographic announcing the Open Data educational platform launch.

Links to social media are provided on all pages, as well as a public forum to post questions. The user is encouraged to become engaged. Visitors to the educational platform are asked for feedback regarding the content and its presentation. The feedback has proven useful and prompted changes to improve the user experience.

Figure 16: The ATLAS Open Data educational platform: There are three sections, called ’Get Started’, ’Web Analysis’ and ’Data & Tools’. Each section has a page with a description of the section and a video detailing what is available in that section. The ’Data & Tools’ page is shown here.

### CERN Open Data Portal

The CERN open data portal [33] provides data and tools for each of the four main LHC experiments: ATLAS, CMS [34], ALICE [35] and LHCb [36]. Figure 19 shows the portal resources. ATLAS Open Data is found under Education.

8 TeV ATLAS Open Data is separated into four categories on the portal:

* 'ATLAS Derived Datasets' contains 58 data samples. These include the two ATLAS Open Data 2016 data files (egamma and muon) plus a single dataset containing all the ATLAS Open Data 2016 data and associated simulated data samples. The rest of the samples are from the ATLAS Open Data MasterClasses dataset.
* 'ATLAS Simulated Datasets' contains the 42 individual simulated data samples for ATLAS Open Data 2016.
* 'ATLAS Learning Resources' provides a link to the International Masterclasses.
* 'ATLAS Tools' provided are the ATLAS Masterclass \(W\)-path software, ATLAS Open Data Software and ATLAS Open Data Virtual Machines.

The CERN Open Data Portal is currently undergoing a redesign with the aim to provide a more user friendly site with a story focused approach. See Figure 19 for the current look. The redesign is scheduled to be delivered by the end of 2017.

Figure 19: The CERN Open Data Portal [33] provides access to data recorded by experiments at the LHC.

the CERN open data are released under the Creative Commons CC0 waiver [37]. Creative Commons provides free, easy-to-use copyright licenses to make a simple and standardised way to give the public permission to share and use a variety of projects. It is made clear that neither the experiments nor CERN endorse works, scientific or otherwise, produced using these data.

### ATLAS Open Data Key

The ATLAS Open Data Key project is an extension of the web platform. We use pen drives to distribute the ATLAS Open Data resources to teachers and researchers developing educational programs outside the ATLAS Collaboration. We had a pilot program between 2016 and 2017, and now we have a new external and internal design. The keys are loaded with educational resources, with the aim to share the data and tools with students with poor or no internet access. This simple idea has been compelling to distribute resources and as a diplomatic "present" when meeting new ATLAS Open Data consumers and academic organisations. See Figure 20 for a photograph of the ATLAS Open Data Key. The 32 GB pen drive currently contains:

* Documentation for the ATLAS Open Data educational platform, in PDF and GitBook format.
* ATLAS Open Data small Virtual Machine.
* ATLAS Open Data Software.
* Complete ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset
* All videos that appear on the ATLAS Open Data educational platform in mp4 format.

Their content will soon be extended to include:

* ROOT notebooks (when completed).
* All ATLAS Open Data Virtual Machines.
* The Histogram Analyser Applications and ROOTbrowser to work standalone.

Figure 20: ATLAS Open Data Keys.

See Figure 21 for an infographic summarising the contents of the Key.

The CEVALE2VE project [38] in Latin-America has been using a pilot study to test the product. The project is described in more detail in Section 7.5

ATLAS will provide the Key free of charge to universities in developing countries. The Key is also intended to be an easy way for ATLAS collaborators to carry the ATLAS Open Data resources.

## 6 Activities using the ATLAS Open Data masterclass dataset

### International Masterclasses

The International Particle Physics Outreach Group (IPPOG) [39] has developed educational activities that share the excitement of particle physics research. IPPOG offers International Masterclasses [12], which provide an opportunity for 15 to 19 year old students to discover particle physics. Each year more than 13000 high school students visit one of about 200 universities or research centres for one day to participate.

International Masterclasses studied LEP [40] data until 2010, then switching to simulated LHC [41] data. ATLAS data were first used in 2011 [4] and 8 TeV ATLAS Open Data was added in 2015.

In 2016 there were 228 International Masterclasses video conferencing with CERN, of which 125 were studying ATLAS data. In the same year there were also 48 International Masterclasses video-conferencing with Fermilab, of which 15 were ATLAS based.

In the first five months of 2017, 264 International Masterclasses video-conferenced with CERN, of which 138 were studying ATLAS data. In the same period 50 International Masterclasses video-conferenced with Fermilab, of which 15 were ATLAS based. In 2017 International Masterclasses ran in 50 countries from all continents except Antartica. ATLAS data was studied in 34 of these countries. Figure 22 displays the worldwide reach of International Masterclasses using ATLAS Open Data.

## Z-Path

_Welcome to the Z-path Here you will learn about some particles, such as the Z boson and the Higgs boson, and their importance to our understanding of Nature. In this quest you will use real ATLAS data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN._

_Before taking on this task, we will lead you through a journey into the tiniest structures known to me. The elementary particles. You will see how these can be produced in proton-proton collisions at the LHC, and you will learn how to identify elementary particles in the ATLAS detector. Finally, you will do a real physics measurement on fresh data from the ATLAS detector: identify the Z boson and other lighter particles and measure their properties! You will have the opportunity to search for the Higgs boson in a similar way the ATLAS physicists have done. You will then realize that you have mastered a tool for discovering the unknown!_

The data is thus used for students to get a feeling for the concept of spin. The Z-prime boson, \(Z^{\prime}\), is a heavier partner the \(Z\) boson that is predicted to exist by many new physics theories.

Figure 26 is a screen shot of some results from an ATLAS International Masterclass, showing invariant mass plots for \(\ell\ell\), \(4\ell\) and \(\gamma\gamma\) final states.

Figure 26: International Masterclass: Activity studying invariant mass. The top three distributions have a mass range from 0 to 200. The aim of those is to search and visualise the and Higgs bosons. The lower three distributions have a mass range from 800 to 1800. In this exercise, some simulated data of an hypothetical and Graviton have been injected into the data-samples to show the students how new particles could appear in the data and to trigger the discussion about new physics beyond the Standard Model.

## 7 Activities using the ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset

### Projects using the ATLAS Open Data educational platform

The ATLAS Open Data educational platform is described in Section 5.

A number of university lecturers have used the educational platform directly with undergraduates or developed courses around the platform. University summer students and high school students visiting CERN have also used the educational platform to learn about ATLAS and particle physics. A selection of activities based on the ATLAS Open Data educational platform are presented here.

#### 7.1.1 University of Montreal undergraduate physics course

Subatomic physics is a course in second-year undergraduate physics at the University of Montreal, Quebec [43]. It is the first time the students learn about particle physics, so the first four weeks involve a general introduction to particles and detectors. The following few weeks are spent in a class equipped with computers and the ATLAS Open Data educational platform is used to learn about and perform particle physics data analysis. The undergraduate course started in February 2017.

The Associate Professor running the course has been in contact a number of times, making suggestions and asking questions. The feedback has been very useful, understanding how the data is being used by undergraduate students.

#### 7.1.2 Lund University advanced particle physics undergraduate course

Twenty students from the fourth-year advanced particle physics course participated in a two hour session held at Lund University, Sweden [44]. Working in four groups, each group studied an analysis using the small ATLAS Virtual Machine. The session ended with presentations by each group.

#### 7.1.3 The University of Michigan - CERN Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates Program

The University of Michigan [45] - CERN Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates Program (UM-CERN REU) [46] provides undergraduate students from around the United States an opportunity to conduct nine weeks of summer research based at CERN. The program is conducted in concert with the National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program and is supported by funds from the National Science Foundation [47]. Every year the program runs from the beginning of June to the beginning of August.

In 2016 the program involved 17 students. Four students attended a two hour session dedicated to using and testing the educational platform. They provided very useful verbal feedback and some suggestions for improvements. Extensive email feedback was received from one student, who was unable to attend the session. In 2017, the students had a dedicated workshop organised for them at CERN to study ATLAS Open Data with the ATLAS Open Data educational platform.

#### 7.1.4 California State University physics undergraduate course

A group of California State University [48] undergraduate physics students are using the ATLAS Open Data educational platform to learn about particle physics alongside their particle physics lecture courses.

#### 7.1.5 LIP particle physics introductory lectures

Laboratorio de Instrumentacao e Fisica Experimental de Particules (LIP) is using the ATLAS Open Data educational platform for teaching and outreach work within the university.

A one-week particle physics introductory lecture course, followed by a two-month research project, is offered to undergraduate physics students. The lectures include a first session with HYPATIA, focused on understanding the characteristics of different events as seen by the detector. Following by a session with ATLAS Open Data, where the job is focussing on the \(W\) analysis since LIP works on the \(WH(H\to bb)\) and \(ZH(H\to bb)\). In the ATLAS Open Data session, students learn how to run an analysis, produce distributions of the quantities they saw qualitatively during the first session mentioned above.

The ATLAS Open Data educational platform is also used for two-three days workshops on particle physics for students thinking about starting a master thesis.

It is intended that the ATLAS Open Data will be used for master-level students as an introduction to physics analysis.

#### 7.1.6 Maastricht University liberal arts and sciences program

The physics department at Maastricht University, Netherlands [49], offers a lecture course twice a year which includes a four week research based learning project studying LHC open data. The intention is to give undergraduate students a taste for doing independent research. In 2015 CMS open data was used. In 2016, 8 TeV ATLAS Open Data was used.

At the time of the 2016 course, the ATLAS Open Data Virtual Machines were not available, so students were provided with two simple ROOT scripts, one to iterate over the data and the other to plot and make distributions. The students, working in groups of four to six, used the ATLAS Open Data educational platform documentation and tried coding up the different selections described for the different processes.

#### 7.1.7 Technical University of Dresden particle physics course for masters students

The Technical University of Dresden [50] offered the course 'Exploring Particle Physics Hands-on methods using LHC data' for master students during the summer term 2017. The goal of the course was to provide an overview of the ATLAS detector, discuss particle identification and highlight the latest LHC results. The course had 13 lectures coupled to 13 tutorials where the students implemented some basic experimental methods discussed in the lectures using ATLAS Open Data.

In the tutorials the students received a skeleton analysis based on the Python \(H\to WW\) analysis provided in ATLAS Open Data, then developed their own \(H\to WW\) analysis. The students prepared the full analysis chain from selection optimisation, signal estimation, background calculation using data-driven techniques and finally estimated the Higgs signal significances.

The students had previous programming experience with Python and were able to quickly run the framework and produce data-to-simulation comparisons. Since they had to develop their own analysis they faced real-life challenges of physicists, like issues with normalising the simulation, having to consider other backgrounds in the control regions, limited Monte Carlo statistic. All of these issues triggered a lively and interesting discussion about analysis techniques and particle physics. The course was a great success.

Additionally, the Technical University of Dresden supervises high school students in a voluntary final-year project in the context of their high school exams ('Besondere Lernleistung'). By the time this survey was done, two students were doing their projects with ATLAS Open Data. One senior student was working on an optimisation of the default event selection in the \(Z^{\prime}\) analysis. Using a script to calculate the expected significance, the student implemented several selection criteria and optimised the selection values for different \(Z^{\prime}\) mass hypotheses. The second student was studying the different decay possibilities of a \(Z\) boson on her own using a reduced version of the ATLAS Open Data \(Z\) analysis. An expended goal for this project is to redo a basic electron calibration using the provided data.

#### 7.1.8 KTH Royal Institute of Technology masters in Engineering and Education

Two students from KTH, Sweden [51], created a website [52] incorporating the ATLAS Open Data tool Histogram Analyser (Section 4.2.1). The website aims to give simple explanations of experimental particle physics for people without higher education in physics. Concrete examples and everyday analogies are used to make the physics content more accessible.

Analogies can be used to relate abstract concepts to more familiar phenomena and are useful for providing conditions for the understanding of science [53]. The website includes a tool to study some animal's common quantities. The tool is a simplified version of Histogram Analyser, just showing three variables; number of animals, continent and mass. In this way selection criteria, as carried out in physics analysis, are explained.

Figure 27 shows a screen shot of the homepage.

#### 7.1.9 High school students with work experience projects at CERN

Thanks to the different ATLAS member's outreach programs, we, the ATLAS Open Data team, had the opportunities to interact with high school students at CERN. This set of interplays allow us to test our resources with students at this education level and to get valuable feedback from them. At the same time, the students got some experience in how with perform experimental particle physics and data analysis. We can mention two concrete examples below:

Two high school students visited CERN on a one-week work placement. These students had a great advantage having ATLAS physicists as parents. They therefore had easy access to age specific help and advice. They both managed to download a Virtual Machine, run the software and produce plots. As part of their school work they were required to write a report of their week. This took the form of a very detailed report, containing extremely useful comments and suggestions.

A sixth form student from the UK visited CERN for a one-week work experience. She worked through all the educational material provided on the ATLAS Open Data educational platform and wrote thorough notes which provided excellent feedback. It was pleasing to know that a sixth form student, with minimal support, could work independently using the educational platform.

### Technical University of Dortmund Particle Physics Laboratory Course

The Technical University of Dortmund, Germany [54], has produced a particle physics laboratory course [55] in which students search for a leptophobic \(Z^{\prime}\) decaying to a pair of top quarks using the ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset. This one day course (in German only) is for undergraduates and postgraduates. It has so far run about five times with student evaluations being very favourable.

In the course multiple topics such as detector behaviour, data analysis, and statistical evaluation are discussed. The students receive a skeleton analysis written in C++ to which they add simple rectangular selections to optimise the phase space for the task at hand. The optimisation tries to find the best expected limits for rejecting the hypothesis of an existing \(Z^{\prime}\) in the context of a cut-and-count analysis. Expected and observed exclusion limits are calculated using different mass points for the hypothetical particle.

Figure 27: Website written as a masters thesis project, inspired by the ATLAS Open Data educational platform, to explain particle physics to everyone.

The Dortmund group has been instrumental in producing the ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset. The laboratory course was created to make use of the data and to share it with other interested parties. The course includes hands-on activities, independent learning as well as a written and oral exam.

### University of Oslo physics undergraduate courses

Research-based teaching projects have been introduced in the University of Oslo, Norway [56], physics undergraduate subatomic physics and advanced particle physics courses.

The \(Z\)-path International Masterclass data contains photon information and has been used for quite some time to study Higgs \(\to\gamma\gamma\) events and spin related variables. The Oslo group successfully modified the ATLAS Open Data 2016 gamma dataset to extend this study. Simulated \(Z^{\prime}\) and graviton events have been added to the data. The former, being spin-1, decays only into \(\ell\ell\) while the latter, with spin-2, can decay to \(\ell\ell\), \(4\ell\) and \(\gamma\gamma\).

A requirement of \(\geq\)1 leptons or \(\geq\)2 good photons is made on the existing gamma dataset and then a completely new dataset is created with photon information added. For the moment, this has been implemented on a fraction of the ATLAS Open Data 2016 gamma dataset. See Figure 28 for an example plot from an undergraduate project looking for \(Z^{\prime}\).

As part of the mentioned particle physics courses, three 3-month student research projects are available to students for developing, using this data:

* What do 4-lepton final states tell us about the Standard Model and the Higgs boson?
* Do new fundamental forces or extra space dimensions show up at the LHC the way the \(Z\) and Higgs bosons did?
* Is the world supersymmetric and/or where is Dark Matter?

It is intended that the full gamma dataset, with photon information added, plus accompanying simulated data will be produced and made available on the CERN Open Data Portal.

### University of Athens undergraduate particle physics laboratory

The University of Athens undergraduate particle physics laboratory uses HYPATIA online, as described in Section 4.2.7.

The students perform the analysis and event selection optimisation using the user friendly graphics interface which controls the selection parameter values and generates all the necessary histograms and significance plots based on the students' settings. The students perform the analysis and event selection optimisation using the user-friendly graphical interface which controls the selection parameter values and generates all the necessary histograms and significance plots based on the students' settings. This GUI-driven exercise involving data analysis is used as part of the Particle Physics laboratory at the Universities of Athens and Birmingham [57].

See Figure 29 for an example result of a HYPATIA online analysis, showing simulated data histograms before and after parameter optimisation.

### CEVAL2VE

CEVALE2VE [38] (Centro Virtual de Altos Estudios de Altas Energias) is building collaborative networks with and between Latin American institutions. The aim is to motivate physics undergraduate and master students to consider a career in scientific research by introducing them to particle physics. The ATLAS Open Data educational platform is fundamental to achieve these goals and is one of the main educational tools used.

The members of CEVALE2VE are a group of about ten Venezuelan and Colombian researchers, currently involved in projects related to High Energy Physics (HEP) and data science. Since 2014 CEVALE2VE have organised several HEP e-courses for undergrad and master students and webinars for Colombian and Venezuelan universities. The e-courses consist of lectures and hands-on exercises.

The ATLAS Open Data Key, as described in Section 5, has been produced with such countries in mind to provide ATLAS Open Data to students with limited access to the internet.

There are currently three main activities being run by CEVALE2VE using ATLAS Open Data, described below.

* e-course 'Introduction to particle physics' The e-course runs for about 16 weeks, introducing master and final-year undergraduate students to particle physics and associated data-analysis techniques. Hands-on exercises use ATLAS Open Data. A set of ten students followed the educational activities on the ATLAS Open Data educational platform and two of them used the ATLAS Open Data for their final course project. The set of tools provided in ATLAS Open Data Software helped to improve the IT skills of the students.
* Student theses A Venezuelan student at the Central University of Venezuela (UCV) [58] defended her masters thesis in May 2017. She used ATLAS Open Data to perform estimations of Dark Matter candidate production at 8 TeV. Another student at UCV successfully defended her undergraduate thesis in July 2017. She studied different kinematic variables and reconstruction techniques for \(W,Z\) and Higgs bosons at 8 TeV using the ATLAS Open Data Jupyter and ROOT notebooks. The main aim of this thesis was to use basic analysis techniques as used by ATLAS physicists. Both students got their corresponding degree and continue working in physics.
* 'Physics Without Frontiers' [59] The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical [60] 'Physics Without Frontiers' programme works to inspire, train and motivate physics and mathematics university students in developing countries to help build the next generation of scientists. Five universities in Venezuela and Colombia were visited in October 2016. This was a substantial outreach programme to inspire and engage physics students with cutting-edge research activities using ATLAS data. Activities using the ATLAS Open Data Key took place.

The ATLAS Open Data educational platform is proving to be a useful resource for university lecturers. Typical sessions include a variety of activities including presentations, hands-on activities, tutor led as well as independent study, oral examination and written reports. Sessions vary from a one day activity to extended laboratory courses over a number of weeks. When asked what the intended outcomes of a session, course leaders responded saying:

* Learn about data analysis in High Energy Physics: techniques and tools, programming in C++/Python, link concepts learnt during the classes with hands-on activities.
* Students should get an impression of research in data analysis.
* Undergraduate students will have had about five weeks of lectures before, introducing them, for the first time, to particle physics. The ATLAS Open Data is part of the course that follows, and its goal is to give them a hands-on experience of concepts previously introduced. We also aim that they have a feeling of the work of research in particle physics (and physics in general).
* Inspiration for young high school students, as well as introduction to the high tech world of particle physics.
* University students perform measurements, using analysis and statistical tools in a way very similar to actual research.

Many university groups are still in the process of developing their resources. The number of people involved working and presenting the material is on average only two people per university group. The resources will hopefully continue to grow and evolve as university groups start getting to grips with the data and how they want to use them.

Feedback is also being collected from the ATLAS Open Data educational platform users to measure success. Over 73% of users have responded positively to the feedback survey questions "Did you find the data and information presented interesting?" and "How likely are you to recommend ATLAS Open Data to a friend or colleague?"

The educational platform has proved to be accessible to motivated high school students. This is shown by the positive feedback from the students. A British 'A-level' student wrote on the educational platform feedback survey "The new videos explain the educational platform really well [...] The glossary helped everything make much more sense [...]

The Histogram Analyser is a great idea and I think it's great that users can feel involved with ATLAS when using this feature - the same goes for the live events where it is really exciting seeing the events as they happen. Altogether, it's a great educational platform, everything is presented so well that it is a pleasure not only to read but to look at too!"

"I had a really interesting, fun experience, so thank you for this week."" wrote one of the two high school students who spent a week of work experience at CERN. The other high school student added "I really appreciated the week working for ATLAS outreach and I learned a lot too. Thank you for giving me this opportunity, it was very interesting and a fun way to spend my work experience." Additionally one of their physicist parents said "It was fun for me too, answering a lot of his questions over Skype."

### Plans for future

Releasing 13 TeV ATLAS data is being considered. However advertising and encouraging use of the current 8 TeV data is seen as the priority. The format of future datasets is under discussion. Comma-separated-values files would allow data to be saved in a table-kind format. JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight data-interchange format, easy for humans to read and write. ROOT ntuple or XML files are also options.

Educational analysis software is continuing to be developed. The interactive programming environment using ROOT and Jupyter technology is being developed. The existing educational analysis framework code in C++ continues to be worked on.

The ATLAS Open Data educational platform is under reorganisation: including a design update, addition of a blog section to highlight the use of the resources by other teams and members, plus an improved FAQs and user forum.

## 9 Conclusion

International Masterclasses are a long running and consistently popular outreach activity. The numbers of countries and students involved continues to increase. International Masterclasses study ATLAS Open Data with high school students. HYPATIA is also used to study ATLAS Open Data with high school students and undergraduates.

The ATLAS collaboration released 1 fb\({}^{-1}\)of 8 TeV data in 2016, with the aim of providing more advanced activities for university students. The ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset has been made available on the ATLAS Open Data educational platform and the CERN Open Data Portal. The ATLAS Open Data educational platform is achieving international impact and has had over 11000 visits since its launch in July 2016.

Long term and formal educational projects have shown relevant results in the creation and utilisation of the resources. For example, the physics groups in Lund and Montreal Universities have run undergraduate courses using the ATLAS Open Data educational platform, which have proved very popular. The Oslo University group is very actively using ATLAS Open Data and are now modifying the ATLAS Open Data 2016 dataset to extend their research-based teaching projects. CEVAL2VE is taking ATLAS Open Data to Latin America. Finally, various other university students have used the ATLAS Open Data educational platform for different projects.

The ATLAS Open Data educational platform is not just accessible to physics undergraduates. High school students visiting CERN and masters students in education have also studied ATLAS data using the ATLAS Open Data educational platform.

The ATLAS Open Data educational platform was released less than one year ago, so many university groups are still in the process of developing their resources. Added to this, the number of people involved working and presenting the material is on average only two people per university group. A large number of students have accessed ATLAS Open Data and hopefully even more will do so in the future.
