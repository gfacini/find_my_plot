User Requirements Document

1. INTRODUCTION

### Purpose of this document

This document attempts to establish the requirements which the ATLAS level-2 trigger system has to fulfil as seen from the viewpoint of the end users and those responsible for the systems and sub-systems with which the level-2 trigger interacts.

### 1.2 Scope of Level-2 Trigger System

The level-2 trigger system is part of the trigger and DAQ system of the ATLAS experiment [2]. The primary data flow connections in the T/DAQ system and connections between level-2 and the control systems are shown in Fig. 1.1

For the purpose of this document, the Level-2 trigger system is considered to comprise the hardware and software for the following items:-

the interfaces to the level-1 system;

the interfaces to the read-out buffers;

the level-2 processing system including processors associated with the interfaces;

the interfaces to the DAQ/EF system;

the interfaces to the Detector Control systems;

The following items are not included for consideration here:-

the read-out buffers - a separate URD [3]exists for these;

run control, status and monitoring - these tasks are assigned to the Back-end DAQ [4]

### 1.3 Document overview

A general description of the LVL2 system and related external systems is given in Section 2.1. Some of the main capabilities are discussed in general terms in Section 2.2. Constraints are discussed in Section 2.3. These descriptions do not define system requirements; they are intended to make the requirements listed in Section 3 more easily understandable.

Figure 1.1: Trigger and DAQ system main data flow and control connections to level-2.

The requirements are classified into capability requirements, which describe what the users want the level-2 system to be able to do, and constraint requirements, which place restrictions on how the capability requirements are to be met.

The capability requirements are given in Section 3.1. The constraint requirements, given in section 3.2, include constraints imposed on the LVL2 system and constraints imposed by the LVL2 system on the interfaces with related external systems. The LVL2 system cannot meet its own requirements unless these 'interface' requirements are satisfied by the external systems. The list of capability and constraint requirements is given in section 4.

Section 5 contains a set of appendices covering acceptance testing and verification plans; names of the editorial and review group; a detailed document change history for this version and a list of tasks still outstanding.

### Definitions and acronyms

Backend DAQ System (BEDAQ) [4]:

an external system used to set and log the status of the LVL2 system.

Candidate object:

entity to be considered against the criteria for trigger objects.

Data Acquisition System (DAQ):

system external to LVL2 responsible for the permanent storage of data from events accepted by all three levels of the ATLAS trigger system and data generated within the trigger system.

Detector Control system (DCS) [5]

the system responsible for the control and monitoring of the hardware of ATLAS.

Event builder (EB):

part of the Event Filter/DAQ system that usually collects full information from all parts of all detectors, for a given bunch crossing. Only partial collection may be necessary for certain classes of LVL2 accept. This operation occurs after acceptance of an event by the LVL2 trigger.

Event Filter (EF) [6]:

the third level of event selection, responsible for reducing the data volume to a value acceptable for permanent storage (\(\sim\) 100 Mbytes/s).

Farms of processors:

multiple processors operating in parallel on different events, or on different parts of an event, under control of a supervisor. Their use is made necessary when the realisation of algorithmic tasks in a single processor introduces computational delays longer than those allowed by the desired repetition rate of the tasks.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]

* preparatory local transformations necessary to convert raw data in the readout buffers to a format and content better suited for data movement and/or for processing in Level-2 algorithms.
* Primary Region of Interest (PRoI)
* a region of interest identified as a probable contributor to the LVL1 trigger acceptance decision.
* Raw Data :
* data as received in the readout buffer from the readout driver.
* Readout Buffer (ROB) [3]:
* the units which receive raw data as transmitted by detector ROD systems and keep them in memory until no longer needed by other sub-systems (e.g. Level-2, Event Filter).
* Readout Driver (ROD) [7]:
* the most downstream functional unit of the frontend electronics, which communicates directly with the readout buffer via a readout link; its typical tasks are the collection of information from multiple frontend sources onto a single high-bandwidth link, the adaptation of data formats, and the addition of bunch crossing and LVL1 trigger number information.
* Region of Interest (RoI):
* a region limited in eta and phi, indicated by the level-1 trigger to contain candidates for objects requiring further computation. In the case of B-physics triggers at low luminosity, RoIs may also be defined internally within the level-2 trigger system.
* RoI Builder:
* a unit inside level-2 which uses level-1 information to identify regions of interest and formats the information for level-2.
* Run Control System (RCS):
* External system which provides a user interface for entering commands and for problem diagnosis.
* Secondary Region of Interest (SRoI)
* a region of interest which probably did not contribute to the LVL1 accept decision (e.g. too low an energy for the accepted trigger objects)

* the unit which controls the overall data flow and the allocation and status of processors.
* [1] Tagging: operational mode where the LVL2 process is followed, the results appended to the data stream but no event selection is made.
* [2] Throttle: a means to reduce or inhibit data input to or from the level-2 trigger system by introducing dead time via the LVL1 system.
* [3] Trigger item: an entry in the trigger menu defining one set of trigger conditions and based on the detection of one or more trigger objects.
* [4] Trigger menu: the list of all the Level 2 trigger items thus defining the event selection criteria.
* [5] Trigger object: entity corresponding to muon, electron, gamma, single hadron, jet, or missing Et.
* [6] TTC (Timing, Trigger and Control) system [8]: system for distribution of timing, trigger and control signals. The system delivers standard signals (e.g. LHC clock, LVL1 accept, Bunch Counter reset (BCR), Event Counter Reset (ECR), etc.) and permits the distribution of detector specific commands and data.
