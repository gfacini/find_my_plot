A calibration procedure for the alignment bars of the ATLAS muon spectrometer endcap has been developed. It was successfully tested under realistic conditions on prototype bars.

Introduction

The alignment concept for the ATLAS muon spectrometer endcap relies on so-called alignment bars; these bars constitute an intermediate reference system to which the muon chambers are aligned [1]. Optical sensors (BCAMs) mounted on platforms on bars allow the relative alignment of all the bars in the different endcap stations; the alignment of chambers with respect to bars is provided by additional optical sensors (PROXimity monitors) mounted on platforms attached to chambers, facing elements on bars. In order to make use of the high intrinsic accuracy of the muon chambers, it is required to align them to a precision of \(40\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) over distances of up to \(15\,\mathrm{m}\).

The alignment bars proposed for ATLAS are long (up to \(9.6\,\mathrm{m}\)) aluminium tubes. At the level of accuracy required here, these objects cannot be considered as rigid bodies, and therefore have to be monitored by optical (RASNIK) and temperature (Pt100) sensors which measure their deformation respectively thermal expansion. In order to make use of the information provided by the RASNIKs, i.e. to derive the deformation of an alignment bar from the readings of the sensors, a calibration is required. This note describes the method that has been worked out for this purpose, and reports on the results of a test of the procedure and its quality.

## 2 Alignment bar calibration

### Instrumentation and interpolation

In-bar RASNIK and temperature sensors (together referred to as in-bar sensors, see Fig. 1) provide a precise measurement of the positions of three points on the bar, relative to two other points on the bar which define the \(Z\) axis of the bar coordinate system. The latter points may (but need not) be chosen as the support points of the bar.

The five directly monitored points are those where RASNIK elements are positioned. Between these points, an analytic model of the bar shape [2] is used for interpolation, in order to obtain the positions of the points where alignment sensor platforms are attached. The discussion of this analytic model is beyond the scope of this note; the baseline of the method is to use three virtual forces (or continuous force distributions) as effective parameters to fit the bar shape function to the five points measured by the RASNIKs; the expected deformations of the bar due to gravity are also included.

### Requirements and specifications

Simulation studies have shown that in order to reach the design sagitta precision the total uncertainty of the bar shape must be less than \(30\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\)[3]. In a more precise wording, the positions of all points on the bar must be known to less than \(30\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) in the bar coordinate system.

Alignment bars as delivered by the manufacturer have an undefined intrinsic shape. They are straight to better than \(1\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{m}\), two orders of magnitude worse than the level of accuracy required here. In order to use the analytic model for the bar shape (which assumes an initially straight bar), the initial shape of the bar has to be measured once; from then on, deformations are well described by the model, as they can be linearly superimposed to the initial shape.

The bar calibration thus consists of two distinct parts: the measurement of the initial shape of the bar,1 and the determination of a prescription that relates the movements of the points where in-bar sensor elements are mounted to the values measured by these sensors.

### Procedure

The comparatively large outer bar diameter of \(80\,\mathrm{mm}\), as well as its non-negligible deviation from perfect circularity, make it impractical to measure the shape directly on a coordinate-measurement machine (CMM). Instead, small steel balls of a few mm diameter glued to the bar are used to define and measure all relevant points on the bar. In addition, such balls are also present on the alignment sensor platforms attached to the bar; on these balls, alignment sensors are mounted once the bar is installed in the experiment.

Note that although this is called a measurement of the bar shape, the real (mechanical) bar shape actually remains unknown; it is only known that the points on the bar move together in a well-defined way according to the mechanical properties of the bar, which is fully sufficient.

In detail, the calibration of an alignment bar proceeds as follows (for simplification, the temperature of the bar is assumed to be stable, but the procedure is easily extended to accomodate temperature changes):

* Balls are glued on the bar approximately in those places where the in-bar stations supporting RASNIK elements are fixed to the bars. The precision required for this is moderate, of the order of a few mm. All the alignment sensor platforms are attached to the bar in the positions defined by the alignment system design.
* The positions of all balls on the bar are measured with the CMM, relative to an appropriately chosen bar coordinate system (defined by some of the balls on the bar, such that the \(Z\) axis points approximately along the bar axis and \(X\) and \(Y\) are transverse to it). The in-bar RASNIKs are read out continuously during the measurement process, in order to ensure that variations in bar shape are small; afterwards, the readout values are averaged. Together, the measured temperatures, ball positions, and RASNIK readout values represent the initial bar shape.
* The bar is deformed such that the readout values of the RASNIKs change significantly, i.e. with a magnitude that is of the same order as the deformation expected in the experiment. This can either be done by changing the direction of gravity (i.e. by rotating the bar around its axis), or by applying one or many external forces, or by a combination of the two. The above measurements are repeated for each deformation (from here on, CMM measurements are only needed of the balls near RASNIK elements). While only one deformation measurement is strictly necessary for the calibration, making a number of further deformations is advisable in order to cross-check the calibration result, and is even required in order to quantify its quality.

The relative transverse movements of the balls from their initial positions are denoted as \(X_{\mathrm{ball},\ldots}\) and \(Y_{\mathrm{ball},\ldots}\); the quantities \(Z_{\mathrm{ball},\ldots}\) denote the absolute longitudinal positions. In order to obtain the relationship between ball movements in the bar coordinate system and changes in RASNIK values, the following quantities are computed from the movements of the balls near the respective RASNIK elements:

\[X_{\mathrm{ball}} = (1+1/m_{\mathrm{ball}})(X_{\mathrm{ball},\mathrm{lens}}-X_{ \mathrm{ball},\mathrm{ccd}})-(X_{\mathrm{ball},\mathrm{mask}}-X_{\mathrm{ ball},\mathrm{ccd}}), \tag{1}\] \[Y_{\mathrm{ball}} = (1+1/m_{\mathrm{ball}})(Y_{\mathrm{ball},\mathrm{lens}}-Y_{ \mathrm{ball},\mathrm{ccd}})-(Y_{\mathrm{ball},\mathrm{mask}}-Y_{\mathrm{ ball},\mathrm{ccd}}), \tag{2}\]

where

\[m_{\mathrm{ball}}=\frac{Z_{\mathrm{ball},\mathrm{ccd}}-Z_{\mathrm{ball}, \mathrm{lens}}}{Z_{\mathrm{ball},\mathrm{lens}}-Z_{\mathrm{ball},\mathrm{ mask}}} \tag{3}\]

denotes the magnification factor.

Similarly, the changes in the values measured by the RASNIK can be expressed as:

\[X_{\rm RAS} = (1+1/m_{\rm RAS})(X_{\rm RAS,lens}-X_{\rm RAS,ccd})-(X_{\rm RAS, mask}-X_{\rm RAS,ccd}), \tag{4}\] \[Y_{\rm RAS} = (1+1/m_{\rm RAS})(Y_{\rm RAS,lens}-Y_{\rm RAS,ccd})-(Y_{\rm RAS, mask}-Y_{\rm RAS,ccd}), \tag{5}\]

where

\[m_{\rm RAS}=\frac{Z_{\rm RAS,ccd}-Z_{\rm RAS,lens}}{Z_{\rm RAS,lens}-Z_{ \rm RAS,mask}}\approx m_{\rm ball}, \tag{6}\]

and \(X_{\rm RAS,...}\) and \(Y_{\rm RAS,...}\) denote the transverse movements of RASNIK elements in the RASNIK coordinate system, which is defined by the positions and orientations of the CCD and the mask.

The calibration thus consists of finding the relation between the bar coordinate system and the RASNIK coordinate system. This is done by making coincide the two vectors \((X_{\rm ball},Y_{\rm ball})\) and \((X_{\rm RAS},Y_{\rm RAS})\) in the two-dimensional \(X\)-\(Y\)-plane by a rotation around the origin, with angle \(\alpha\), and by multiplication with a scaling factor,2\(s\) (Fig. 2). In addition, the reversal of one of the RASNIK coordinate system axes may be necessary, depending on the orientation of the mask.

Footnote 2: In principle, the scaling factor should not be necessary, since it looks like it can only serve to parameterize possible deviations of the mask square size and the CCD strip pitch from the specified values. It turns out, however, that it is indeed required, namely in order to absorb the initial inaccuracy of gluing balls to the bar in places where RASNIK elements are inside the bar, i.e. the approximation made in assuming \(m_{\rm ball}\approx m_{\rm RAS}\). Typical values are \(s=0.99\ldots 1.01\).

These two calibration constants per RASNIK fully characterize the bar, in conjunction with the set of numbers describing the initial shape. Using them, any change in the RASNIK readings \((X_{\rm RAS},Y_{\rm RAS})\) can be translated into a change in the quantity \((X_{\rm ball},Y_{\rm ball})\), from which the movements of the balls at RASNIK elements can be derived, which in turn serve as input to the interpolation procedure for movements of all the other relevant points, which are finally added to the initial positions.

### Results

Results have been obtained from measurements of four 9.6 m long and two 2.6 m long bar prototypes with a CMM at Freiburg University (Germany). These bars are used in the H8 endcap alignment test setup at CERN; their main difference compared to the final ATLAS bars is the smaller number of external platforms for alignment sensors.

Due to the limited reach of the CMM in Freiburg (which is already among the largest CMMs in Europe), only limited portions of the 9.6 m long bars, i.e. points over a maximum range of about 6 m, could be measured without moving (and inevitably deforming) the bar. Therefore, only the two short RASNIKs (looking from one end of the bar to the center, over a distance of 4.8 m) could be directly calibrated, by measuring portions of the bar from one end to the middle. For the calibration of the long RASNIK (looking from one end of the bar to the other), the middle portion of the bar was measured, and the readings of the two short RASNIKs (after calibration) were combined with CMM measurements of the balls at their masks and lenses in order to compute 'virtual CMM measurements' of the balls at the CCDs of the short RASNIKs, which are in turn identical to the balls at the CCD and the mask of the long RASNIK. Due to the extrapolation involved, the precision of the long-RASNIK calibration is expected to be worse than that of the short-RASNIK calibration. The initial shape of the bar was obtained by combining the measurements of two portions of the bar; to account for the small deformation of the bar between the measurements, the change in RASNIK readings was used to correct one of the measurements back to the shape which the bar had during the other measurement.

During the measurement the bar had to be supported such that touching the balls with the CMM probe head could not deform the bar or excite vibrations. This was done by carefully tightening three fixation screws near the middle of the bar such that they did not themselves deform the bar, while at the same time inhibiting vibrations and deformations. Over the full time of a measurement, the short-RASNIK readings fluctuated typically by no more than a few \(\upmu\)m, and the fluctuations of the long-RASNIK readings were at the level of \(10\,\upmu\)m. This indicates the level to which the bar could be stabilized.

The calibration measurements were performed in different rotations around the bar axis, and in different deformations for each rotation which were obtained by attaching weights to the bar. Calibration constants derived from different sub-sets of these measurements usually showed good agreement, but occasionally also served to identify problems.3 After rejecting obviously faulty measurements, the calibration parameters were computed as the error-weighted mean values from the remaining measurements (Table 1).

Footnote 3: Especially, one ball was identified whose position seemed to behave completely unpredictable and which therefore could not be used for calibration. Later, this was traced back to a miscalibration of the CMM, which had the effect that measurements of balls performed with different orientations of the probe head had a constant offset. With the exception of this one ball, all others had (rather incidentally) always been measured with the same probe head orientation and were therefore not affected.

The cross-check measurements show that the calibration of the short RASNIKs is better than about \(10\,\upmu\)m r.m.s. for deformations4 of up to \(10\,\)mm, and that the calibration of the long RASNIK is better than about \(25\,\upmu\)m r.m.s. for deformations of up to \(10\,\)mm (Table 1).

Footnote 4: That is, for a change in the quantities of Eqs. (1) or (2) of \(10\,\)mm. This corresponds, for example, to a movement of the lens by \(5\,\)mm while CCD and mask stay in place (for a symmetric RASNIK, where \(m=1\)).

From these values for the calibration accuracy one can derive the accuracy to which the position of any point of the bar is known (Fig. 3). The accuracy is better than \(10\,\upmu\)m everywhere over the full length of the bar, better than \(5\,\upmu\)m on average, and thus considerably below the specification of \(30\,\upmu\)m. Consequently, it leaves enough room to accomodate the additional contribution from the interpolation uncertainty, which has not been included here.

The calibration of the first alignment bar was accomplished in eight working days of about 9-10 hours each. This comprises time for the programming of the CMM, for the actual measurements, and for moving the bar between the different portions of the measurement. The number of deformation measurements chosen was significantly larger than necessary, in order to have sufficient data for cross-checks and quality control; this leaves potential to speed up. On the other hand, various reasons not related to the bars or the method caused the calibration of the subsequent bars to take significantly more time.

## 3 Summary

A calibration procedure for the RASNIK sensors in the alignment bars of the muon spectrometer endcap has been developed and successfully tested. It has been shown that the calibration of short RASNIKs (\(4.8\,\)m length) is better than about \(10\,\upmu\)m r.m.s., and that the calibration of long RASNIKs (\(9.6\,\)m length) is better than about \(25\,\upmu\)m r.m.s. This leads to an accuracy of better than \(10\,\upmu\)m to which the position of any point on the bar can be determined from the RASNIK measurements, neglecting the additional contribution from the interpolation uncertainty for points inbetween RASNIK elements.

## 4 Outlook

The calibration procedure for the long RASNIK is unsatisfying. It would be desirable to have a layout that permits all RASNIKs to be calibrated directly, i.e. without the extrapolation procedure. Such a layout does indeed exist; two possibilities, one with three and one with four RASNIKs, are shown in Fig. 4. The first one still requires to measure three portions of the bar, while the second one permits a calibration from the measurement of only two portions of the bar and thus reduces the total calibration time by \(1/3\).
