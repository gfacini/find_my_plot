August, 2000Introduction

The purpose of these measurements was to compare the optical properties of the batch 1 tiles made of PSM-115 polystyrene with the new tiles made of BASF polystyrene. We give results on the tile scintillator uniformity, the attenuation length and the light yield for old and new tiles.

## 2 Measurements

Responses from tiles of various sizes ( tile sizes 1, 2, 7, 9, 10, 11) were measured using the **Sr\({}^{\bf 90}\)** radioactive source. All the tiles were measured with the final tyvek masked envelope and always with the same fiber. The light response was measured making a tile central scan with the radioactive source at different distances to the tile extremity read by the WLS fiber.

The attenuation length \(\lambda\) and the light yield \(I_{0}\) were evaluated by fitting the response curve with a simple exponential function \(I=I_{0}\) e \({}^{-d/\lambda}\).

## 3 Results

The results of measurements are plotted on Fig. 1 for a single fiber readout. A clear improvement of the optical properties of the new tiles is observed for all the measured tile sizes.

For the new tiles the light yield in the central position increase by 30%, 10% and 60% for the sizes 7, 9 and 10 respectively. This improvement is also evident in the light attenuation length and light yield as it is seen in Table 1.

The width of the black strip (masking) inside the white tyvek paper that envelops the tiles was initially optimized for the old tiles made of PSM-115 polystyrene. We observe that this mask is attenuating too much the short wave length component of the light in the new tiles made of BASF polystyrene. This can be observed in Fig. 2 for the tile size 10. In the new tiles the signal at the extremities is reduced by 4 % with respect to the average signal, while in the old ones the response is less affected by the black masking strip. The RMS of the new tile is 2.1%, and 1.9% for the old one. The average light yield is ~50% bigger for the new tiles.
