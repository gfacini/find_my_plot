###### Abstract

The detection of the \(\pi^{0}\) and \(\pi^{0}\) production cross section at the LHC is investigated in the case where one baryon-number violating coupling dominates. Simulations are performed of the ATLAS experiment at the LHC for all couplings, other than \(\pi^{0}_{\mathrm{KK}}\) since neutralino decays through these couplings are very suppressed. Secondary vertex distributions and muons produced by heavy-quark (\(b\)- and \(c\)-) jets allow discrimination between LSP decay modes. The dominant coupling can be identified at better than 3.5 in almost all cases, with the only remaining ambiguity caused by the inability to distinguish strange from down quarks.

## 1 Introduction

In supersymmetry (SUSY) models where \(R\)-parity, \(R_{P}=(\ 1)^{38+L+2S}\), is violated (RPV models) the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) can decay to Standard Model particles. For the baryon-number violating RPV coupling, \({}^{0}\), the LSP, assumed to be the \(\sim_{1}^{0}\), decays via a virtual squark into three quarks (or antiquarks). In previous work [1] we suggested a method by which the masses of several of the SUSY particles can be measured in such scenarios for a wide range of \({}^{0}\).

If \(R\)-parity violating couplings are observed, it seems probable that they come from an underlying theory which also determines the fermion mass spectrum. This idea has been explored [2(5) in the context of gauged \(U(1)_{K}\) models ofavour, in which a hierarchical pattern of RPV couplings is generated by the same symmetry from which the fermion mass spectrum is derived. Thus the determination of the flavour structure of an RPV coupling could be a vital clue in the resolution of the flavour problem.

In this paper we investigate theavour content of the quark jets from \(\gamma\) decays. The aim is to identify which \({}^{0}_{ijk}\) coupling is dominant in the neutralino decay. The index \(i\) is the generation number of an up-type quark, and \(j\) and \(k\) correspond to down-type quarks. The coupling is antisymmetric in \(j\) and \(k\), so there are nine possible non-zero elements.

Three of the couplings, \({}^{0}_{ijk}\), produce very different signatures because they allow the \(\sim_{1}^{0}\) to decay via the top quark. If the neutralino is lighter (heavier) than the top quark then the decay is propagator (phase-space) suppressed. For the SUGRApoint we investigate (which is described in Section 2) the branching ratio through the top coupling is a factor of \(4.2\cdot 10^{6}\) smaller than through a non-top coupling of the same size.

For a top mode to dominate the decay, a coupling to top would need to be a factor of at least 2000 greater than any of the non-top couplings. In that case the lightest neutralino would typically be long-lived (Figure 1) and for \(\stackrel{{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{$\Box$}}}{{\mbox{\tiny tjk}}}<10^{2}\) nearly all \(\stackrel{{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{$\Box$}}}{{\mbox{\tiny tjk}}}\) is decay outside the detector. Determination of these couplings could then only be achieved by searching for the rare decay of \(\stackrel{{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{$\Box$}}}{{\mbox{\tiny tjs}}}\) in the active volume, while sparticle mass measurements could be made in the same way as for the \(R_{\mbox{\tiny P}}\) conserving case [6].

We investigate the other six couplings \(\{\stackrel{{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{$\Box$}}}{{\mbox{\tiny tds}}}, \stackrel{{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{$\Box$}}}{{\mbox{\tiny tudb}}}, \stackrel{{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{$\Box$}}}{{\mbox{\tiny tubb}}}, \stackrel{{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{$\Box$}}}{{\mbox{\tiny tds}}}, \stackrel{{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{$\Box$}}}{{\mbox{\tiny tds}}}, \stackrel{{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{$\Box$}}}{{\mbox{\tiny tds}}}\}\) and \(\stackrel{{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{$\Box$}}}{{\mbox{\tiny tcbb}}}\) ( assuming that one is significantly larger than the others. Since the branching ratio is proportional to the square of the coupling, it is sufficient for this analysis that all the subdominant couplings are 4.5 times smaller than the dominant coupling. Then just 5% of all \(\stackrel{{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{$\Box$}}}{{\mbox{\tiny tjs}}}\) will decay though the subdominant channel, and 90% of events, each with two \(\stackrel{{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{$\Box$}}}{{\mbox{\tiny tjs}}}\), will contain only dominant-coupling decays.

The solid line shows the lifetime for a dominant top quark coupling, which leads to the decay \(\stackrel{{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{$\Box$}}}{{\mbox{\tiny tjs}}}\) : \(\mbox{qq}^{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{$\Box$}}\) : \(\mbox{qq}^{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{$\Box$}}\) : \(\mbox{qq}^{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{$\Box$}}\) : \(\mbox{qq}^{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{$\Box$}}\) : where q and q are quarks other than top and f and f are Standard Model fermions. The dashed line shows the lifetime for couplings to quarks other than the top. The calculation approximates the final state particles as massless, so that the lines for \(\stackrel{{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{$\Box$}}}{{\mbox{\tiny tjs}}}\) are the same for all jjk, as are those for \(\stackrel{{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{$\Box$}}}{{\mbox{\tiny tjs}}}\) for all i6 tjjk.

## 3 Vertex Tagging

The lifetimes of hadrons containing b- and c-quarks give rise to displaced vertices which can be reconstructed from charged tracks in the inner detector. In general the lifetime of channel hadrons are shorter than for hadrons containing a b-quark, for example \(c_{\mbox{\tiny D}\,\circ}=124\) m compared to \(c_{\mbox{\tiny B}\,\circ}=468\) m. This allows statistical separation of c-quark jets from b-quark jets, and of c- and b-jets from light quark (u,d,s) and gluon jets. Strange hadrons have longer lifetimes with c- of the order of tens of centimeters. Since they decay to a small number of particles it is difficult to reconstruct a secondary vertex, and so strange hadrons cannot be tagged within jets in the LHC environment.

The vertex tagging performance of the ATLAS Inner Detector was simulated in [6]. In that study a likelihood ratio method was applied to the transverse impact parameter (\(d_{0}\)) of the tracks within the jet cone. The resultant b-tagging efficiency and the rejection rates for c- and other jets were parameteresed as functions of the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of the reconstructed jet and were inp

respectively). The variable,

\[{}^{2}=\begin{array}{cc}X&\frac{(x_{i}\quad y_{i})^{2}}{2\quad x+\quad y}\\ \end{array}\]

was calculated, where \(x_{i}\) and \(y_{i}\) are the fractions of events with \(i\) in \(i\) in \(i\) (or vertex tags) for the test pair of couplings and the \({}^{2}\)s are their variances assuming Poisson-distributed numbers of events. Bins where one or other distribution contained fewer than \(\nu\) events were excluded.

The calculated \({}^{2}\) values for both the muon and vertex-tagging plots are shown in Table 3.

If we use only the muon information then all couplings are distinguishable at 90% except for the ambiguity between \(d\)- and \(s\)-jets. In general the vertexing rate gives better discrimination, but would be difficult for a long-lived \(\sim_{1}^{0}\) for the reasons discussed in Section 3. Combining the results from both analyses gives separation at better than 3.5 in all cases, again with the exception that it is not possible to distinguish down from strange quarks.

The statistical errors are those expected for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb \({}^{1}\). Points are horizontally displaced to allow them to be distinguished by eye.

If the branching ratios of the neutralino through two or more couplings were comparable, then as the information in the distributions is rather degenerate, the tri-tue identification of the couplings becomes difficult. However the method could then be used to constrain the possible values of the couplings.

## 6 Conclusions

If baryon-number violating couplings to quarks other than top are \(>5\)\(10^{5}\) then \(\sim\)\(\sim\)\(10^{5}\) will typically decay within the tracking volume of an LHC detector. For these couplings, our simulations show that displaced secondary vertices and muons from heavy quark decays allow statistical separation of b-from c-quark jets, and b-and c-jets from light-quark jets. A dominant RPV coupling can then be identified at better than 3.5, except for an ambiguity caused by the inability to distinguish strange from down quarks.

We have demonstrated that if the MSSM breaks baryon number, not only can the LHC detect and measure the masses of sparticles [1], but it can even distinguish theavour structure of the RPV coupling.
