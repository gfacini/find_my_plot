###### Abstract

The reconstruction of two jets coming from the hadronic decay of W bosons will play an important role in many physics signals at the LHC. These signals include: the search for SUSY, the search for the Higgs boson, the measurement of the top quark mass, and QCD studies. In this note, the reconstruction of W \(\rightarrow\) jet-jet is studied using full GEANT simulation of the ATLAS detector. Mass resolutions as well as reconstruction systematics are evaluated using W bosons of various transverse momenta. Some implications on the top quark mass reconstruction are studied. Finally, the potential of this decay as an in situ calibration tool will be discussed.

Introduction

The reconstruction of two jets coming from the hadronic decay of W bosons will play an important role in many physics signals at the LHC. These signals include: the search for SUSY, the search for the heavy Higgs boson, the measurement of the top quark mass, and QCD studies.

To estimate the performance of the calorimetry system in reconstructing the W \(\rightarrow\) jet-jet decay, the width and average value of the reconstructed mass distribution must be evaluated. The width of the distribution will determine the rejection efficiency for QCD backgrounds since any two jets in the background event can potentially fake the W mass. For some signals, this rejection efficiency could be critical. To understand the systematics associated with the evaluation of the absolute jet energy scale, the average value of the reconstructed mass distribution can be compared to the true W mass. As will be shown in this note, the transfer function between the mass scale and the jet energy scale can be non-trivial: the treatment of overlapping jets, calorimeter shower effects and \(\tt E_{T}\) cuts to reduce pile-up noise can introduce systematic biases.

This note is meant as a backup document to studies performed for the Calorimeter Performance TDR[1]. Although a good part is devoted to the W \(\rightarrow\) jet-jet mass resolution, its main goal is to make a first attempt at evaluating and understanding the systematics of this reconstruction. The top mass measurement in ATLAS and the in situ calibration of the absolute jet energy scale will ultimately depend on the understanding of these systematics.

In the following section, the software and the algorithms that were used will be presented. The various W samples that were produced for this study will then be described. Section 3 is devoted to the results. First, the mass resolution of the W boson will be addressed. Then, some systematics of the reconstruction of the W \(\rightarrow\) jet-jet decay will be investigated. Finally, the effect of the W mass reconstruction on the top mass will be studied. A discussion of the results will follow in section 4.

## 2 Simulation Software and Reconstruction Algorithms

Four different samples of W bosons were produced using PYTHIA 5.7[2]. The generated mass of the W for all samples was 80.5 GeV. First, low (0-50 GeV), W bosons from the Drell-Yan process were produced. Second, for the mid-\(\tt p_{T}\) range (80-250 GeV), WZ and \(\tt\bar{t}\) events were generated. For the WZ events, a \(\pt\) cut of 85 GeV in the center of mass of the hard scattering was imposed. For the \(\ttbar\) sample, the cut was 150 GeV and the generated top mass was 175 GeV. Third, for the high-\(\pt\) range (250-500 GeV), the decay of a heavy Higgs (\(\mH=1\) TeV) to two W bosons was considered, where one of the two Ws was made to decay leptonically. Some kinematic distributions are presented in figures 1 and 2 for the four samples. Whether the W Drell-Yan or WZ signals can be extracted from the background is not relevant to this part of the study since its purpose is to evaluate the intrinsic performance of the calorimeter and the systematics associated with the reconstruction algorithms. In particular for those signals, to avoid combinatorial backgrounds coming from hard gluon radiation, the jets closest to the W decay partons were chosen. This was not the case for the Higgs or \(\ttbar\) signals however.

The detector simulation was done with GEANT 3.21[3] with the geometric description of DICE(95-6). The hadronic transport package was G-FLUKA. Although the geometry of the detector has undergone some important changes since that version, the differences between the results that follow and the ones that would be obtained with the very latest geometry are expected to be minor. This assertion is justified by the fact that jets are less sensitive to small scale geometric features and that few of the jets in the samples quoted above are in the barrel-endcap transition region.

The reconstruction program was ATRECON (95-6). The jets used here were reconstructed at calorimeter level, i.e. they were considered massless. The algorithm that was used to find jets was the standard fixed cone jet finder provided in ATRECON. A cone of R=0.4 was chosen to limit the effect of minimum bias pile-up noise.

Three methods were used to determine the invariant mass of the W:

* The mass was simply calculated from the 4-momenta of each jet: \[M_{W}{}^{2}=(\,P^{\mu}_{\langle j1\rangle}+\,P^{\mu}_{\langle j2\rangle})(\,P_{ \mu\langle j1\rangle}+\,P_{\mu\langle j2\rangle})\]
* The mass was calculated by taking into account the "4-momentum" of each calorimeter cell included in the two R=.4 jet cones. \[M_{W}{}^{2}=(\,\sum_{i=1}^{N_{cell}{}^{\mu}}\,P^{\mu}_{cell\,i})^{2}\]
Figure 1: Top plots: low \(\rm p_{T}\) W kinematics. Bottom plots: mid-\(\rm p_{T}\) W kinematics

Figure 2: Top plots: mid-p\({}_{\rm T}\) W kinematics from \(\rm t\overline{t}\). Bottom plots: high p\({}_{\rm T}\) W kinematics.

* Method 3
* Same technique as the second method but the energy was collected in only one cone of R =.5 or.6. This last method is used only when the two jets from the decay of a high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) W severely overlap.

The advantage of the third method is that it is not necessary to employ an energy sharing scheme when the two jets overlap. For method 2, energy sharing is only needed to determine the jet baricenters. This defines the list of cells that will be used in the mass reconstruction. Once the cell list is determined, no energy sharing is required and the evaluation of the angle between the two jets is not needed since the known angle of each cell is used. In the case of method 1 however, the energy of each jet has to be determined as well as the angle between them. To do this, the centroid of each jet was obtained by sharing the energies according to the following steps:

* In the first iteration, all the energy in the overlap was assigned to one jet and the jet momenta were calculated.
* In the second iteration, the energy in the overlap region was shared equally and the jet momenta were recalculated.
* Finally, the energy in the overlap region was shared in proportion to the jet energies calculated in the second step. The jet momenta were then calculated for the last time. In the case of the severely overlapping jets of the high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) W sample, another method was used to share the energy. Using the centroids obtained with the preceding steps, the energy of each jet was then recalculated by assigning the energies of cells in the overlap region to the closest jet. The reason for the use of this other method will be made clear in the next section.

To generate high luminosity (10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) pile-up noise, minimum bias events were simulated using DICE. To build the pile-up "event", a random number of events per bunch crossing was chosen using a Poisson distribution with a mean of 23. Then, the energy response of each bunch crossing was convoluted with the shaping functions of the various calorimeters. The barrel and endcap liquid Argon calorimeters use bipolar shaping whose response to a triangular input pulse lasts for over 500 ns. This means that the energy deposition of over 20 bunch crossings must be considered. An interesting feature of bipolar shaping in this case is that, without energy cuts, the average pile-up noise distribution is centered at \(\sim\)0. To reduce the effect of pile-up noise, a 1 GeV \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) cell level cut was applied to each.1 x.1 (\(\Delta\eta\)x\(\Delta\phi\)) calorimeter tower. For more details on the method used and the properties of pile-up noise in the calorimetry system, see [4, 5].

The standard energy calibration of ATRECON was applied, with some changes based on more recent Monte Carlo results [5]. On top of that, the jet energy scale had to be adjusted on a case by case basis depending on the cone size used and whether pile-up was included. The jet energy scale was found by multiplying the reconstructed jet energy by the average of the ratio of the parton energies to the reconstructed jet energies. This needed to be done for every reconstruction method, cone size and cell \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) cut used (when pile-up is added).

## 3 Results

### Mass Resolution

In all the following results, \(\pm\) 2 \(\sigma\) Gaussian fits were performed on the reconstructed mass distributions, except when significant tails were present. Unless explicitly mentioned, method 1 was used to reconstruct the mass.

#### 3.1.1 Low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) W Results (0-50 GeV)

Figure 3 shows the reconstructed mass spectrum for W bosons from Drell-Yan production. As was shown in figure 1, the W has an average \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of 25 GeV and produces 2 well separated jets in the calorimeter. The \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) cut on the jets was set to 25 GeV. With this low cut on the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of the jet, a mass resolution of about 9.2 GeV is obtained as is shown in figure 3a. In figure 3b, the full line shows the mass distribution of u and d quarks while the dashed line is the equivalent for c and s quarks. To evaluate the contribution to the resolution coming from the energy and angle measurements, parton information was used. Figure 3c shows the reconstructed mass when the angle is obtained from the partons while for figure 3d, the parton energies are used. In this \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) regime, it is clear that the mass resolution is dominated by the energy reconstruction.

This is confirmed in figure 4a, where the reconstructed mass is shown when the energy in the cones is corrected on an event by event basis (\(\mathrm{M_{W}}_{\mathrm{corr}}\) = \(\mathrm{M_{W}}_{\mathrm{rec}}\mathrm{x}\mathrm{E_{parton}}/\mathrm{E_{rec}}\)). The full line distribution in figure 4b was obtained using method 1 while the dashed line was obtained using method 2. For this \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) regime, the difference between the two methods is negligible. Figures 4c and 4d show the mass resolution when high luminosity (\(10^{84}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)), pile-up is added. For the two plots, a \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) cut of 25 GeV was imposed. Although the addition of pile-up deteriorates the resolution by \(\sim\)5 GeV, figure 4d shows that, using method 1, pile-up noise does not bias the mass distribution. In table 1, the results obtained with method 2 are shown. In this case, the Figure 3: Low \(\rm p_{T}\) W results.

Figure 4: Low \(\rm p_{T}\) W results.

reconstructed mass is about 2 GeV lower than the generated value.

The low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) W results show no systematic biases in the mass reconstruction and in particular, in the angle and energy reconstructions. Both mass reconstruction methods give, within errors, the same results. The addition of pile-up does not introduce mass shift effects, except for method 2. Most of the above results are summarised in table 1.

#### 3.1.2 Medium \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) Results (80-250 GeV)

As can be seen in figure 1, the two jets from W bosons with an average \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of 150 GeV generally overlap (they have a separation of less than 1.4)1. This is true even if the smaller cones used in these studies do not overlap. This means that even for jets that are separated by.8 or more, some energy from the first jet is included in the second jet's cone.

Footnote 1: Over 95% of the jet energy is contained in a \(\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}=.7\) cone around the \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) weighted baricenter.

Figure 5 shows equivalent plots to the ones shown in figure 3 for the low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) W sample. In figure 5a, the presence of a low mass tail can be seen in the distribution. The average reconstructed mass is about 1 GeV lower than the generated value. The two bottom plots show that the tail comes from a bias in the reconstruction of the angle. Figure 5c shows that the tail disappears when the angle between the quarks is used. When the angle between the jets is considered but the quark energies are used, a low mass tail appears and the angle resolution is about 2 GeV worse than the well separated jets of the low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) W sample. This is shown in figure 5d.

Figure 6 shows the equivalent plots to figure 4. Figure 6b shows a significant difference between the two mass reconstruction methods. Adding

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c|c|c||} \hline Method & Avg. Rec. Mass & Sigma \\ \hline Method 1, no pile-up & 80.7 \(\pm\).4 GeV & 9.2 \(\pm\).3 GeV \\ \hline Method 2, no pile-up & 79.6 \(\pm\).3 GeV & 9.5 \(\pm\).4 GeV \\ \hline Method 1, no pile-up, quark energy & 80.6 \(\pm\).1 GeV & 2.8 \(\pm\).1 GeV \\ \hline Method 1, no pile-up, quark angle & 80.8 \(\pm\).4 GeV & 8.9 \(\pm\).3 GeV \\ \hline Method 1, pile-up & 80.6 \(\pm\).6 GeV & 13.8 \(\pm\).5 GeV \\ \hline Method 2, pile-up & 78.6 \(\pm\).6 GeV & 13.8 \(\pm\).6 GeV \\ \hline Method 1, pile-up, quark energy & 80.5 \(\pm\).1 GeV & 2.6 \(\pm\).1 GeV \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Low-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) W results.

pile-up noise deteriorates the resolution substantially. By asking for a higher p\({}_{\rm T}\) cut on the jet energy and a greater separation between the two jets, the resolution improves by 3 GeV as is shown in figure 7a. Figures 7b to 7d show the mass distribution for three jet distance bins. The improvement in the resolution and the diminution of the tails as the distance in creases is evident from these plots. Most of the above results are summarised in table 2.

#### 3.1.3 High p\({}_{\rm T}\) Results (250-500 GeV)

For W bosons with an average p\({}_{\rm T}\) of 370 GeV, the average distance between the two jets is \(\sim\).5 in \(\eta\times\phi\) (for longitudinal bosons). Reconstructing the 4-momenta of the jets becomes difficult and dedicated algorithms must be used.

The full line in figure 8a shows the mass distribution when a.2 cone is used to reconstruct the angle of the jets. The dashed line distribution was obtained using.4 cones. The use of smaller cones to reconstruct the angle is clearly preferable in this case. Although the angle was reconstructed with a.2 cone, the energy was collected in a.4 cone because of a substantial deterioration of the energy resolution when.2 cones are used for the energy reconstruction. For the rest of the high p\({}_{\rm T}\) plots, a cone of R=0.2 is used for the angle reconstruction.

Figure 8b shows that using only events where the jet separation was greater than.4 reduces the tail present in the full line distribution of figure 8a. From figure 8d, one can see that for this high p\({}_{\rm T}\) sample, the contribution of the angle resolution constitutes an important part of the mass resolution. The angle between the two jets is underestimated since the reconstructed mass is 4 GeV too low.

Method 3, where the cells from one.5 cone are used to obtain the mass of the W is compared to method 2 (two.4 cones) in figure 9a. Both methods

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c|c|c||} \hline Method & Avg. Rec. Mass & Sigma \\ \hline Method 1, no pile-up & 79.5 \(\pm\).2 GeV & 7.7 \(\pm\).3 GeV \\ \hline Method 2, no pile-up & 80.7 \(\pm\).4 GeV & 8.3 \(\pm\).4 GeV \\ \hline Method 1, no pile-up, quark energy & 78.3 \(\pm\).1 GeV & 4.2 \(\pm\).2 GeV \\ \hline Method 1, no pile-up, quark angle & 81.9 \(\pm\).2 GeV & 7.4 \(\pm\).3 GeV \\ \hline Method 1, pile-up & 78.4 \(\pm\).6 GeV & 12.9 \(\pm\).6 GeV \\ \hline Method 2, pile-up & 81.2 \(\pm\).8 GeV & 12.5 \(\pm\).5 GeV \\ \hline \end{tabular}

overestimate the generated mass of the W by about 6 GeV. Method 3 appears to have less of a tail on the low mass side of the distribution. Figure 9b compares the reconstructed mass distribution using method 3 but with a cone of R=.6. The resolution improves but the reconstructed mass is nearly 9 GeV too high.

The effect of high luminosity pile-up noise on the mass reconstruction is shown for the different methods in figures 9c, 9d and figure 10. For method 1, pile-up does not affect the average value of the reconstructed mass whereas it lowers the reconstructed mass for other methods. Most of the above results are summarised in table 3.

### Relation Between the Mass scale and The Jet Energy Scale

In this section, the transfer function between the mass scale and the jet energy scale is studied. Naively, this function would be expected to be trivial e.g. if the jet energy scale is 5% too low then a 5% lower mass should be reconstructed. This means that the ratio of the mass scale to the jet energy scale should be 1. However, the energy reconstruction part of the mass determination is not the only component to this transfer function. The assignment of the correct energy to each jet and the angle reconstruction between the two jets can be subject to systematic biases. In the case of methods 2 and 3, no energy sharing is needed and the angle of each cell is already known, but calorimeter showers can introduce mass shifting effects. This will be discussed in the next section.

The results of section 3.1 showed that the average reconstructed mass of the W could be different from its generated value, depending on the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of the W, which method was used and whether pile-up noise was added. This is despite the fact that, for the mass distributions shown in the last section, the jet energy scale was corrected by taking the average of the ratio between the parton energy to the reconstructed energy for each \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) sample, mass reconstruction method and cell \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) cut. However, since the average scale was used for each sample, non-linearity of the calorimeter response can introduce systematics in the mass reconstruction. Furthermore, because of the transverse boost of Ws with higher \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\), the jets are more collimated and a larger fraction of their energy will be contained in the jet cones. To determine if these two systematic effects are responsible for the mass shifts seen in section 3.1, the ratio of the mass scale to the jet energy scale \(((\mathrm{M_{W_{rec}}/M_{W_{gen}}})/(\mathrm{E_{jet_{rec}}/E_{parton}}))\) was calculated on an event by event basis. Therefore, any effect arising from non-linearity in the energy response or boost effects are corrected. In each of the cases considered, only events whose reconstructed mass was within 15 GeV of their average reconstructed value were used in the determination of the ratio.

In figure 11, the mass scale to energy scale transfer function is plotted for low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) Ws. Methods 1 and 2 are compared with and without pile-up. As one would naively expect, the ratio is consistent with unity, for both methods. When pile-up is added however, method 2 gives a lower reconstructed mass.

In figure 12, the plot is shown for mid-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) Ws. In this case the two mass reconstruction methods diverge for Ws with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) above \(\sim\) 250 GeV. As the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of the W increases, method 1 gives decreasing masses while method 2 gives increasing masses.

This last trend is made more explicit for the high p\({}_{\rm T}\) sample. In the top plot of figure 13, methods 1 and 2 are compared using a.2 cone to reconstruct the angles. Method 1 remains stable although the reconstructed mass is 90% of its generated value. The transfer function for method 2 increases steadily with the p\({}_{\rm T}\) of the W.

In the lower plot of figure 13, the effect of adding pile-up is evaluated using the two methods. Although method 1 remains stable, the transfer function appears pile-up dependent for the second method. This was already seen for Ws with higher transverse momenta in the mid-p\({}_{\rm T}\) sample. In figure 14, method 2 and method 3 are compared. The biggest effect is seen for method 3 with a cone of.6.

In figure 15, an attempt is made to correct for the observed rise of the W reconstructed W mass when method 2 is used. Here a linear correction is applied to the reconstructed mass as a function of the W p\({}_{\rm T}\). The mass resolution improves by about 3.5 GeV without pile-up and by 1 GeV with pile-up. The bottom plot shows that the correction gives a constant ratio as a function of the W p\({}_{\rm T}\).

In figure 16, the fully simulated results are compared to what is obtained at particle level using the ATLAS fast simulation program ATLFAST [6]. The algorithms used in this note had to be included in the program. Detector resolutions and the magnetic field are taken into account by ATLFAST but the calorimeter showers are not parametrised. The top plot shows that, for method 1, there is little difference in the ratio of the jet energy scale to the mass scale between particle level and full simulation. As can be seen in the bottom plot however, there are important differences with method 2. In particular, the particle level jet scale to mass scale ratio without the magnetic field is consistent with unity. A slight rise is observed when the magnetic field is switched on.

An attempt will be made in section 4 to explain the effects described above.

### Top mass reconstruction

The calibration of the calorimeters of ATLAS will be a challenging task given its many subdetectors and number of channels. To take full advantage of potential physics signatures, a precise determination of the absolute energy scale will be required.

In the LHC environment, the reconstruction of Z and W bosons are very promising in situ calibration tools for the EM and hadronic calorimetry respectively. For the determination of the jet energy scale, the very imposing \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) cross section (\(\sim\)700 pb) will provide a large sample of hadronically decaying W bosons. For example, at low luminosity \(10^{83}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), 60000 \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events will be produced each day, out of which 1000 semi-leptonic decay events (\(l\nu jjjjj\)) can be reconstructed. This sample can be very easily separated from QCD W+jets and WW background thanks to the large statistics. The shape of the W+4 jets background should be very well understood by studying Z+4 jets events which will also constitute a large data set[7]. Furthermore, the contamination from hard gluon radiation can be suppressed by requiring only four jets in the event. Finally, combinatorial backgrounds can be reduced by requiring two btags. The W sample so obtained can then be used to determine the absolute jet energy scale (for ud and cs quarks) over most of the \(\eta\) range of the calorimetry system.

The top event sample used in this study contains 6800 fully simulated events. The \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) cut in the center of mass of the hard scattering was set to 150 GeV. The \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) distribution of the Ws was shown in figure 2. The reconstruction of tops with such transverse momenta is facilitated by the fact that the decay products of each quark are generally divided into two well separated hemispheres. The events were selected using the following cuts:

* 2 b-tags with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) greater than 25 GeV (28 GeV when pile-up is considered). A jet was considered a b if it was reconstructed within a.2 cone of the original b quark direction.
* The two non-b jets that have the highest \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) are considered W jet candidates.
* The \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of a W jet candidate has to be greater than 40 GeV.
* W jet candidates have to be within \(\Delta\mathrm{R}=1.4\) of each other.
* The closest b jet to the W candidates is used to reconstruct the top mass.

With the above cuts, the W mass distribution obtained is shown in figure 17a for method 1 and figure 17b for method 2. To obtain the average jet energy scale, the correct jet-parton assignment was determined using particle level information. However, this information was not used in the previous and future distributions. In fact, the tails coming from the wrong parton assignment can be seen on both sides of the distribution. Figures 17c and 17d show the same distribution when a jet veto is imposed. In this case, all events with more than 4 jets above a \(\rm p_{T}\) of 17 GeV without pile-up2 and 18 GeV with pile-up, were rejected.

Footnote 2: In the reconstruction program, the cut is set at 15 GeV. However, once the energy scale is corrected for the cone size and the cell \(\rm E_{T}\) cuts used, the effective cuts correspond to the values quoted above.

The top mass was reconstructed using the b jet 4-vector i.e. only the 4-vector of the jet was used for the b jet reconstruction. Contrary to the W mass reconstruction with method 2, the cell 4-vectors of the b jet were never used for the top mass reconstruction. The energy scale for the b jet was different than the one used for the W jet candidates. It was taken to be the average of the ratio between the b parton energies over the reconstructed b jet candidate energies.

Figures 18a and 18b show the top mass distributions for both methods. Method 1 gives a mass that is 2 GeV lower than the generated value. In this case the veto was not imposed but a mass bin of +/- 15 GeV was required on the reconstructed W mass. To disentangle the effect of the W \(\rightarrow\) jet jet from the b jet reconstruction, the mass distributions in figure 18c and 18d were obtained by using the b quark 4-vectors.

The mass distributions in figure 19 were obtained with the addition of high luminosity pile-up. A deterioration of \(\sim\)4 GeV is observed in the resolution without any significant mass shift.

In figure 20, W mass distributions for both methods with and without pile-up are shown for the case when the energy is corrected on an event by event basis. This allows the evaluation of systematics not related to the energy calibration and linearity in the jet energy response. Method 1 gives a mass that is 2.5 GeV too low while method 2 gives a mass that is 1-1.5 GeV too high. In figure 21, using the same corrected energy scheme with b quark 4-vectors, the top mass distributions are shown. Although method 1 still gives a top mass that is too low by about 3 GeV, method 2 gives a mass consistent with the generated value. In both cases, pile-up has very little effect on the mean value or the width of the distribution.

By constraining the mass of the W to the average of its generated value (80.5 GeV) on an event by event basis and by using the b quark kinematics, the top distributions of figure 22 are obtained. In this case the reconstructed mass using method 1 is within 1 GeV of the generated value whereas method 2 now gives a mass that is 2.5 GeV too low. Most of the above results are summarised in table 4.

### The Jet Energy Scale and the Top Mass

The mass scale versus jet energy scale for the W bosons of the top sample is shown in figure 23 for both samples with and without pile-up. In the case of method 1, for the correct energy scale, the reconstructed mass of the W is too low by about 3%. In the case of method 2, the reconstructed mass rises as a function of the energy.

The effect of these systematics on the reconstructed mass of the top quark can be seen in figure 24. The reconstructed W mass is constrained to its generated mass by adjusting the jet energy scale on an event by event basis.

### W \(\rightarrow\) jet-jet Reconstruction

The results of section 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 concerning low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) W show no significant systematic bias in the mass reconstruction. The reconstructed jet-jet mass is consistent with the generated W mass for methods 1 and 2. Moreover, for method 1, the inclusion of pile-up does not introduce any significant shifts in the mass distributions. These last remarks are well illustrated by figure 13, where the ratio of the mass scale to the jet energy scale is consistent with 1. The reason why method 2 gives a lower mass is discussed later since the effect is more explicit and easily understood for the other samples.

In the case of Ws with an average \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of 150 GeV, the situation becomes

Mass & Sigma \\ \hline Method 1, no pile-up & 172.9 \(\pm\).7 GeV & 13.5 \(\pm\).6 GeV \\ \hline Method 2, no pile-up & 175.0 \(\pm\).7 GeV & 14.3 \(\pm\).8 GeV \\ \hline Method 1, pile-up & 173.1 \(\pm\) 1.1 GeV & 18.6 \(\pm\) 1.2 GeV \\ \hline Method 2, pile-up & 174.3 \(\pm\) 1.2 GeV & 19.0 \(\pm\) 1.2 GeV \\ \hline Method 1, no pile-up, b kine. & 173.5 \(\pm\).3 GeV & 8.3 \(\pm\).4 GeV \\ \hline Method 2, no pile-up, b kine. & 175.0 \(\pm\).2 GeV & 8.1 \(\pm\).4 GeV \\ \hline Method 1, no pile-up, b kine., cons. fit & 175.7 \(\pm\).3 GeV & 6.2 \(\pm\).3 GeV \\ \hline Method 2, no pile-up, b kine., cons. fit & 172.4 \(\pm\).3 GeV & 5.3 \(\pm\).3 GeV \\ \hline Method 1, pile-up, b kine., cons. fit & 176.0 \(\pm\).4 GeV & 6.5 \(\pm\).4 GeV \\ \hline Method 2, pile-up, b kine., cons. fit & 173.0 \(\pm\).2 GeV & 5.6 \(\pm\).3 GeV \\ \hline \end{tabular}

more complicated due to the overlap of the two jets. In this case the standard expression (equation 1) relating the mass resolution to the energy and angular resolutions of the calorimeter is not applicable.

\[(\frac{\Delta M_{W}}{M_{W}})=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{(\frac{\Delta E_{j1}}{E_{j1}})^{2} +(\frac{\Delta E_{j2}}{E_{j2}})^{2}+(\frac{\Delta\theta_{jj}}{t\,an\,(\theta_{ ij}/2)})^{2}} \tag{1}\]

With method 1, a tail on the low mass side of the distribution appears and the reconstructed mass with method 1 is 1.3% too low. By using parton information, this effect can be attributed to the underestimation of the reconstructed angle between the two jets. The fact that the jets overlap and that energy from one jet gets included in the other tends to pull together their respective baricenters. As the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of the W rises, the overlap between the jets increases and the effect on the mass is more pronounced. This is illustrated in figure 12 where the ratio the mass scale to the jet energy scale is shown to decrease as the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of the W increases. Figure 7 shows that for jets that are well separated, the low mass tail disappears and the reconstructed mass gets closer to the reconstructed mass. For this W sample, the mass distribution of method 1 differs from the one obtained with method 2. The last method is less sensitive to the determination of the baricenters and the reconstructed mass is still consistent with the generated value. However, although not shown in figure 12, this result is rather accidental: when the mass bin cut is removed for the mid-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) sample, the ratio of the mass scale to the energy scale as a function of the W \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) first decreases to values near.95 and then rises to values close to 1.05. A ratio higher than 1 for this method is due to the fact that a particle going in a particular cell will also deposit its energy in neighbouring cells because of showering. When the mass is calculated, the energy is effectively "weighted" according to the relative angle of each cell. The cells surrounding the one receiving the energy from the initial particle will not assign the same weight to their respective energies. The global effect being that the mass gets larger as shower effects become important. This effect is not seen at particle level as was shown in figure 16. A possible explanation for the ratio being initially lower than 1 for lower \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) W is that, because of the offset in the reconstructed jet baricenters, some calorimeter cells which should be included are not taken into account. Although the jet energy scale is automatically readjusted to compensate for the missing energy, the angle component of the mass reconstruction is not taken into account: the weighting of the cells with large angles relative to one another is greater than the weighting of cells whose relative angle is smaller. This asymmetry can lead to the observed effect.

For Ws with an average \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of 370 GeV, the effects observed in the mid-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) sample are much more pronounced. For these severely overlapping jets, the use of cones of R=0.4 for the angle reconstruction produces very large tails in the mass distribution. With smaller cones of R=0.2, the tails are considerably reduced but for method 1, the reconstructed mass is 6% too low. Method 2 and 3 give very similar results with a reconstructed mass that is 8% too high. Using method 3 with a.6 cone the reconstructed mass is 10% too high. Even though the jet energy scale is automatically adjusted when a bigger cone is considered, the increase of the mass with the cone size is expected: some of the extra cells that get included using the bigger cone have a larger weight because their relative angles are larger. This also explains why the ratio of the mass scale to the jet energy scale for method 2 and 3 are more affected by pile-up compared to method 1. The cells that do not pass the \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) cut, which are generally in the periphery of the cones, are not considered. Those cells that are taken out normally contribute a larger weight. In the case of method 1, the energy of those cells is taken out but this does not effect the weight that is assigned to the energy of each jet which is determined by the position of the two \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) weighted jet baricenters.

In the ranges where the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of the various W samples overlap, the mass scale over jet scale ratio plots are consistent with each other. Some caution is advised when making such comparisons however, since the fraction of W of a given polarisation is different for each sample. For a given \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\), transverse Ws will produce jets that have a greater energy asymmetry and which are farther apart than longitudinal Ws. Although a greater jet distance implies less overlap problems, the mass resolution could be worse since the energy part of the resolution is very sensitive by the lowest \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) jet (see equation 1). The highest \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) jet in a transverse W sample will generally be higher than the longitudinal sample but it will also have, on average, the jet with the lowest \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\).

The significant deviation from unity of the ratio of the mass scale to the jet energy scale in the case of high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) W presents a challenge for the in situ calibration of the calorimeters in the high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) range. From these first studies, it is far from clear how much these deviations can be reduced with the use of better algorithms or how well they can be understood and parametrised. It is clear however, that the modelling of shower shapes in Monte Carlo simulations would be very important in the understanding of the systematics.

### Top Reconstruction

The W samples that were used in the resolution section did not come from physics events that are likely to be either produced (heavy Higgs) or isolated (W Drell-Yan). The WZ cross section is relatively small and will suffer from the considerable Z+jets background. To eliminate combinatorial backgrounds due to gluon radiation, the correct jet assignments were selected in the analysis using parton level information. For a more realistic study of the W \(\rightarrow\) jet-jet reconstruction, Ws coming from the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) signal are required. In the analysis, the two most energetic jets are considered W candidates after the double b tag. In this case the combinatorial background from gluon radiation is included and the sidebands in the W mass distribution are clearly seen in figures 16a, 16b and 18a. Asking for a jet veto (no more than 4 jets) reduces the sidebands as can be seen in figures 16c, 16d and 18b.

For the top sample, the reconstructed W mass is 3% too low using method 1 and 2% too high with method 2. The reconstructed top mass is consistent with its generated value with method 2 but it is over 1% lower with method 1. To eliminate any systematic effect coming from the b jet reconstruction, the b quark 4-vectors were used. Although the resolution improved considerably, the b jet reconstruction had little effect on the mean reconstructed top mass. This is expected since the b jet is generally well isolated from the others3 and the b jet calorimeter cells were not used for the determination of the mass of the top (There is no showering effect sensitivity). However, for very high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) top, when the b jets start to overlap with the W jets, systematic complications are likely to arise.

Footnote 3: The average \(\Delta\)R of the b quark relative to the W is equal to 1.6.

Within errors, the addition of pile-up noise does affect the top mass reconstruction.

For the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) range of the Ws in the top sample, the deviation from unity of the ratio of the mass scale to the jet energy scale does not exceed \(\sim 5\%\) for both methods. For method 2, it goes down to about 2.5% when pile-up is included. The effect on the top mass reconstruction of these deviations is shown in figure 24. In this figure, the energy scale is adjusted by constraining the W mass to its generated value. Therefore, a ratio of the mass scale to jet scale less then 1 will cause an overestimation of the jet energy scale. The reverse effect will happen if the ratio if greater than 1. This is illustrated in figure 24: since a correct jet energy scale produces a mass that is too large with method 2, constraining the mass to the generated value lowers the jet energy scale and the top mass decreases. The reverse is true for method 1. It is important to point out that for this plot, no parton level information is used to determine the energy scale for the jets coming from the W. In principle, the in situ calibration of the jet energy scale would be determined in a similar manner.

Although the W mass shifts by about 5% with either mass reconstruction method, the effect on the top mass is much less: \(\sim 1\%\) up to 275 GeV for the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of the W for method 1 and less than 2% for method 2 over the same 

## 5 Conclusions

The performance of the ATLAS calorimetry system in reconstructing the W \(\rightarrow\) jet-jet decay was evaluated using full GEANT simulation of the detector. The study covered low \(\pt\) (0-50 GeV) Ws which produce well separated jets all the way to very high \(\pt\) Ws (250-500 GeV) for which the two jets severely overlap. The effect of high luminosity (\(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) minimum bias pile-up noise on this reconstruction was also studied.

The first part of this note was devoted to the mass resolution performance. Without pile-up, the resolution varied from \(\sim\)9 GeV down to \(\sim\) 6 GeV, going from low \(\pt\) to high \(\pt\) Ws. With the addition of high luminosity pile-up noise, an important deterioration in the resolution was observed for the low \(\pt\) sample giving a resolution of \(\sim\)14 GeV. For the high \(\pt\) case however, this deterioration was marginal giving a resolution of \(\sim\)8 GeV.

The various methods used in this note to reconstruct the W mass were shown to be sensitive to the \(\pt\) of the W and to the addition of pile-up noise. This was despite the fact that the jet energy scale was adjusted individually for each case. To determine if the reconstructed mass dependence was due to non-linearities in the calorimeter response or W boost effects, the ratio of the mass scale to the energy scale was studied. It was shown that, for the method which used calorimeter cell 4-vectors to reconstruct the W mass, calorimeter showers could lead to reconstructed masses which are too high. It was also shown that, for the method which used the jet 4-vectors to reconstruct the W mass, the overlap of the jets can cause a systematic bias in the angle reconstruction giving reconstructed masses which are too low.

The effect of these W reconstruction systematics was also studied in the context of the top mass reconstruction. The jet energy scale was determined by constraining the reconstructed W mass to its generated value. Over a W \(\pt\) range of 250 GeV, the top mass was reconstructed within 2% of its generated value using the cell 4-vector method, while it was found to be within 1% using the jet 4-vector method.

The use of the W \(\rightarrow\) jet-jet decay in \(\ttbar\) events for the in situ calibration of the absolute jet energy scale appears very promising. However, to take full advantage of this method in the high \(\pt\) range (above 300 GeV), a good reconstruction of overlapping jets or precise modelling of calorimeter shower effects will be necessary.
