###### Abstract

The background measurements performed during special runs with high \(\beta^{*}\) optics at the injection energy of the LHC accelerator using the ALFA detectors in the ATLAS experiment are reported. Such special runs require dedicated collimation settings to minimize the irreducible beam-induced background. Thus, the physics data-taking had to be preceded with a series of tests of different collimation settings. The note covers background measurements performed during test runs in 2017 and 2018, as well as the background measurements during the 2018 physics run. The spatial distributions of background protons during physics data-taking are also discussed. In addition, a new type of collimators based on the crystal channelling effect was used during a subset of the fills. Data taken using crystal collimation scheme are also discussed and compared to runs with use of the two-stage collimation scheme.

## 1 Introduction

Usually, measurements in high energy physics are performed with the highest possible energy. Within this note, the operation at the LHC injection energy - 450 GeV per beam - is discussed. There are two main physics arguments motivating such measurements. First, there are no proton-proton collision data between ISR [1] and LHC energies \(-\sqrt{s}=62\) GeV and \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV per beam, respectively. The existing measurements with proton-antiproton collisions performed at the Tevatron [2] at 900 GeV energy per beam are characterized by a large discrepancy [3]. The second reason is the measurement of the total cross section \(\sigma_{tot}\) at low energy, which is an important ingredient to predict \(\sigma_{tot}\) beyond the LHC energies [4]. Such measurements are possible only very close to the beam, thus the beam-induced background optimization is extremely important.

ALFA stands for the Absolute Luminosity For ATLAS [5]. It is a detector designed to determine the luminosity by measurement of the elastic scattering in a very forward direction [6]. ALFA is an ensemble of eight detectors located in four stations around 240 m from the ATLAS IP (Interaction Point) [5; 6]. The use of the Roman Pot technique allows movement of the detectors inside of the beam pipe aperture. When the beam parameters are stable, the Roman Pots can be moved towards to the beam to a distance of a few millimeters. Such operation requires a strong cooperation of the ALFA team, collimation experts and LHC operators. Hence, the ALFA movement system is controlled only from the CERN Control Centre.

Each ALFA run must be preceded by a Beam Based Alignment (BBA) procedure, during which the Roman Pots are moved towards the beam until the detectors "touch" the beam. This moment can be recognised by a sudden increase of the rate seen by the Beam Loss Monitors (BLMs) [7]. On this basis, the Roman Pots data-taking position can be easily calculated.

ALFA operates only under specific beam conditions. This document discusses ALFA special runs with \(\beta^{*~{}2}\) = 100 m at the injection energy (450 GeV per beam). More details about the beam parameters are presented in Section 2. Such conditions require dedicated settings of the collimation system, the so-called collimation scheme, which had to be tested before the physics data-taking to assure the level of background allows measurement of the elastic signal [7; 9; 10; 11]. Similar testing procedures were performed for previous special ALFA runs with different beam parameters [12]. The Collimation Working Group (CWG) prepared several collimation schemes and performed appropriate simulations, which were tested during the test runs in 2017 and 2018. Background measurements are described in Section 3. After several tests in October 2018, two new collimation schemes fulfilling the background requirements were found and subsequently used during physics data-taking: one using standard collimators and one using a new type of collimators based on the crystal channelling effect [13; 14].

The crystal collimators were tested at the LHC, but never previously used during the physics data-taking [15; 16]. As the beam intensity for ALFA runs was much reduced in comparison to the standard LHC beam operation (Section 2), it was a good opportunity to perform a first data-taking with use of the crystal collimators, see Section 5.

Background observations from physics data-taking are presented in Section 4 and Section 5 for standard collimators and crystal collimators, respectively.

## 2 Tracking, Trigger and Beam Conditions

A sketch of all ALFA detectors is presented in Fig. 1. On each side of the IP there are two stations - inner and outer, positioned about 237 and 245 m from ATLAS IP, respectively. Each station hosts two detectors - upper and lower. On SIDE A (left hand side of the IP, looking from centre of the LHC ring) the detectors are installed on Beam 2 (beam which is circulating in counter clockwise direction, on the schemes marked as red). The SIDE C (right hand side of the IP, looking from centre of the LHC ring), analogically is installed on Beam 1 (circulating in clockwise direction, marked as blue). In this note, a reference frame with the x-axis pointing towards the accelerator centre, the y-axis pointing upwards and the z-axis along one of the beams is used.

The ALFA tracker detector, called the Main Detector (MD), consists of ten double layers of crossed scintillating fibres. Each layer contains 64 square fibres coated with a thin layer of aluminium. The size of a single fibre is 0.5\(\times\)0.5 mm\({}^{2}\). More details about the detector construction can be found in [6].

Besides the scintillating fibres, each tracker contains two 3 mm thick scintillating tiles used for triggering. Each proton passing the ALFA tracker has to pass through those tiles. Only events where both scintillating tiles produced signals are accepted. Trigger signals from all detectors are sent via eight air-core cables to the ALFA_CTPIN module [17; 18]. The ALFA_CTPIN is a VME module used for fast decoding and conversion of trigger signals to the standard used by the ATLAS Central Trigger Processor (CTP) [19]. ALFA_CTPIN allows recording the trigger rates for each bunch crossing separately and presents them in a real time in the online monitoring. Readouts are performed about every 1.3 s. ALFA_CTPIN is the only device at the LHC measuring beam properties in such a way [17]. Thus, it is a unique device for measuring effects related to debunching (longitudinal space charge spreading [20]), or beam-induced background [17; 18].

Figure 1: Scheme of the ALFA detectors.

Detectors are grouped in two arms. ARM0 consists of B7L1U, A7L1U, A7R1L and B7R1L detectors, while the ARM1 contains B7L1L, A7L1L, A7R1U and B7R1U detectors. Events that are triggered by all detectors from one arm are called golden events. Those events are dominated by elastic scattering and their rate further in the paper is named the elastic trigger rate. There are also anti-golden events - the ones where all upper or all lower detectors are triggered. The rate of anti-golden events is used to estimate the background to the elastic process.

The data were taken at the LHC injection energy. For the x-plane the betatron function at the ATLAS Interaction Point was \(\beta_{x}^{*}=50\) m, while for y-plane it was \(\beta_{y}^{*}=100\) m. These are the highest \(\beta^{*}\) values possible to fit within the LHC aperture at the injection energy. The same optics was used for test runs and for data-taking.

The nominal emittance, used to determine the settings (distances from the beam) of the LHC collimators and Roman Pots is \(3.5\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\), while the measured one was around \(2.0\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\). The measured value was obtained using the wire scanners [21]. The measurement was performed at the end of every run and represents an averaged emittance value for all of the injected proton bunches.

In each run the beam consisted of six colliding isolated bunches or five colliding isolated bunches plus a sixth non-colliding isolated bunch to estimate the beam-related background (Sections 4 and 5). Colliding bunch refers to a bunch injected in both beams with the same Bunch Crossing IDentifier (BCID) [22]. If the bunch is marked as a non-colliding one, it means the particles are injected only into one beam with the considered BCID. An isolated bunch is when there are no injected bunches within 3 BCIDs ahead nor behind of the considered bunch in both beams. Each bunch contained \(0.8\cdot 10^{11}\) protons.

During the data-taking, the detectors were inserted into a \(3\sigma\) position, that corresponds to the distance of about \(4.5\) mm from the beam centre to the edge of the tracker. The crossing angle between beams was equal to \(0\).

## 3 Initial Tests

The ALFA detectors are very susceptible to the beam halo particles, which contribute to background. The background level can be optimised using a collimation system [7; 9]. Collimation experts prepared several collimation settings which were tested. The aim of these tests was to find an optimal collimation scheme allowing succesful data-taking.

There were four test runs starting from November 2017. During each run, selected collimation schemes were tested. After each tested scheme was put in place, a beam scraping was performed. Scraping is a procedure of beam cleaning by moving collimators towards the beam centre and observation of the BLM rate changes. When the BLM readouts get stable meaning the beam is trimmed to designed width with halo significantly reduced, the collimators are retracted to measurement positions.

The first three test runs (two runs in November 2017 and one in May 2018) were not successful due to a fast background growth. The expected elastic signal rate was around \(10\) Hz, while the observed sum of the signal and the background was reaching the level of a few kHz within a few minutes after each scraping. As there was no online estimation of the physics background for ALFA, it had to be analysed offline. Indeed, the offline analysis proved that for those schemes the background level was too high, thus, there was no possibility to distinguish signal from background.

During 2018, more advanced collimation schemes were investigated through simulations, and tested at the LHC in the beginning of October (the fourth test). Two sets of such settings - one based on a very tight two-stage hierarchy, and the other one based on a crystal collimation - were found to reduce the background by a factor of about 1000 and were thus shown to give satisfactory conditions for the physics data-taking.

## 4 Two-Stage Collimation Scheme

Two-stage collimation scheme means that there are two subsets of collimators closer to the beam than the detectors. The collimation settings that were used during the data-taking period are presented in Table 1.

Naming convention used in Table 1 is a general notation and as an example, TCLA.A5[L/R]3.B[1/2] refers to a collimator type TCLA, located in position A5 within the LHC section. [L/R]3 means Left or Right side of the IP3 and B[1/2] defines which beam the collimator acts on [9; 13]. The layout of the LHC collimation system is presented in Fig. 2.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Collimator** & **Plane** & **IR** & **Setting 1** & **Setting 2** \\ \hline TCP.6[L/R]3.B[1/2] & H & 3 & 5.3 & 5.3 \\ All TCSGs@IR3 & H,S & 3 & 6.3 & 6.3 \\ TCLA.A5[L/R]3.B[1/2] & V & 3 & 2.7 & 2.7 \\ Rest of TCLAs@IR3 & H & 3 & 9.0 & 9.0 \\ \hline TCP.D6[L/R]7.B[1/2] & V & 7 & 3.2/3.0 & 3.2/3.0 \\ TCP.C6[L/R]7.B[1/2] & H & 7 & 4.0 & 4.0 \\ TCP.B6[L/R]7.B[1/2] & S & 7 & 5.7 & 5.7 \\ All TCSGs@IR7 & H,V,S & 7 & 5.0 & 5.0 \\ TCLA.A6[L/R]7.B[1/2] & V & 7 & 2.5 & 2.7 \\ TCLA.B6[L/R]7.B[1/2] & H & 7 & 8.0 & 8.0 \\ TCLA.C6[L/R]7.B[1/2] & V & 7 & 2.7 & 2.7 \\ TCLA.D6[L/R]7.B[1/2] & H & 7 & 10.0 & 10.0 \\ TCLA.A7[L/R]7.B[1/2] & H & 7 & 8.0 & 8.0 \\ \hline TCPPH.4[L/R]1.B[1/2] & H & 1 & 13.0 & 13.0 \\ TCTPV.4[L/R]1.B[1/2] & V & 1 & 2.7 & 2.7/13.0 \\ \hline TCPPH.4[L/R]2.B[1/2] & H & 2 & 13.0 & 13.0 \\ TCTPV.4[L/R]2.B[1/2] & V & 2 & 2.7 & 13.0 \\ \hline TCPPH.4[L/R]5.B[1/2] & H & 5 & 13.0 & 13.0 \\ TCTPV.4[L/R]5.B[1/2] & V & 5 & 2.7 & 13.0/2.7 \\ \hline TCPPH.4[L/R]8.B[1/2] & H & 8 & 13.0 & 13.0 \\ TCTPV.4[L/R]8.B[1/2] & V & 8 & 2.7 & 13.0 \\ \hline Crystal* & V & 7 & n/a & 2.5 \\ \hline Roman Pots & V & 1/5 & 3.0 & 3.0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

After the beam injection, the ALFA detectors were waiting in the home position - about 40 mm from the beam centre. When the beams were stabilised, an initial scraping was performed:

* the TCP.D6[L/R]7.B[1/2] collimators were moved down to 2.5\(\sigma\);
* rest of collimators were moved from injection to the data-taking positions according to values in Table 1;
* the TCP.D6[L/R]7.B[1/2] collimators were retracted to data-taking position according to Table 1;
* the TCLA.A6[R/L]7.B[1/2] collimators were moved from 2.5\(\sigma\) down to 2.0\(\sigma\) position;
* the signal in the BLM stabilised, meaning the halo above 2.0\(\sigma\) was cleaned;
* 2.5\(\sigma\) as presented in Table 1;
* the ALFA Roman Pots were moved into their operation positions, i.e. 3.0\(\sigma\).

During the data-taking, the ALFA shifters were monitoring the elastic and background trigger rates using online monitoring. The trigger rate represents the amount of events per second. The background trigger rate was slowly rising and when its rate reached the elastic one, re-scraping of the beam was requested by ALFA experts - the ALFA Roman Pots were retracted to home positions and the TCLA.A6[R/L]7.B[1/2] collimators were moved from 2.5\(\sigma\) down to 2.0\(\sigma\) position. After the BLM readout got stabilised the TCLA.A6[R/L]7.B[1/2] collimators were retracted to 2.5\(\sigma\) positions, and Roman Pots were reinserted.

During the test runs, the elastic trigger rate was about 20 Hz. During the data-taking runs, the elastic trigger rate after initial scraping was exceeding 25 Hz. If, after re-scraping, elastic trigger rate got lower than 10 Hz, the beam was dumped and the LHC was refilled.

In a preliminary offline analysis elastic event candidates were selected based on their back-to-back topology (golden events) within a geometrically defined fiducial volume. The irreducible background in this sample consists predominantly of accidental coincidences of halo protons and events from diffractive processes. The background contamination in such signal sample is determined from anti-golden events, which consist of pure background. As outlined in Ref. [23], it is supposed to be of the same size as in the elastic sample. According to this method the background fraction is about 0.5%.

The beam-related background can be studied by observing non-colliding isolated bunches. In such runs elastic trigger rate is expected to be 0 Hz as no proton-proton collisions should occur. The averaged trigger rate from the non-colliding bunch during October 2018 physics fill is presented in Fig. 3 (upper panel). The average value is calculated every 100 readouts of the trigger module, which correspond to about 2.5 minutes of data-taking. The plot represents trigger rates from each detector separately. The lower panel shows positions of the Roman Pots in \(\sigma\).

The timeline of this run was the following. The run was started at 11:17, local time, and the beams were injected at 11:30. The first peak visible on the plot represents the initial scraping which started at 11:47. Later on, when the beams were stabilised, the Roman Pots were inserted at 12:16. After a few minutes of the data-taking the background pattern and the rate growth were not satisfying, thus experts requested re-scraping. The final data-taking started at 12:32. As the background was slowly growing, three re-scrapings were requested at 13:14, 14:13 and 15:18. At 15:51 the beams were dumped and the run was ended.

Beam 2 (left side, upper and lower detectors) gave twice more background than beam 1. The ratio of the trigger rates for each detector at the left (A) and right (C) side is approximately time independent. The spatial distribution plot of the beam-related background (collected only from the non-colliding bunch) is presented in Fig. 4. The plot presents events collected during the data-taking period between 13:25 and 14:10. This period was choosen due to very stable beam conditions between scrapings and a good detector performance.

Tracks in the ALFA detector are pre-selected for reconstruction if at least 3 out of 10 layers in each direction have between 1 and 3 hits and for all layers there are not more than 10 hits. From pre-selected events, the software reconstructs the spatial tracks only if there are at least three or more overlapping fibres. More details on the reconstruction algorithms can be found in Ref. [23].

In Fig. 4. a shape of the active part of the detector is clearly visible - a square 32\(\times\)32 mm\({}^{2}\) with cut edge. The green colour corresponds to the beam halo limited by the LHC aperture. Colours from yellow to red shows higher halo in close vicinity of the beam.

Additional plots presenting trigger rates for colliding bunches are attached as auxiliary plots, see Figs 27-31.

## 5 Crystal-Assisted Collimation Scheme

A part of the physics runs were taken using the crystal collimation scheme. Given the promising results from the test with both schemes, the first physics fill with non-colliding bunch injected was performed using only standard collimators (see previous section) and the second one using crystal collimators as primary collimation stage. A total of three physics fills were carried out with the crystal collimation scheme during the high \(\beta^{*}\) run. One of the physics data-taking runs devoted to the crystal collimation scheme was performed with an additional non-colliding bunch and will be discussed in this section.

Initial scraping procedure was the same as for the two-stage collimation scheme (see previous section). After the initial scraping the TCLA.A6[R/L]7.B[1/2] were retracted from 2.5\(\sigma\) to 2.7\(\sigma\) and the crystal collimators were inserted to 2.5\(\sigma\) position. After beams got stable the Roman Pots were inserted to 3.0\(\sigma\) position. The collimator positions for the data-taking using the crystal collimators are presented as Setting 2 in Table 1.

The studied run with crystal collimation scheme had five colliding isolated bunches and one non-colliding isolated bunch in each beam. The averaged trigger rate on non-colliding isolated bunch is presented in Fig. 5.

The beam was injected at 8:50 and the initial scraping followed by crystal collimators insertion happened at 9:09. Roman Pots were inserted at 9:17. The fluctuations after 11:43 are related to wire scan measurements of the beam emittance requested by the ALFA experts. The beams were dumped at 12:38.

It is clearly visible that for more than three hours there was no need to perform re-scraping. The background growth for beam 2 was much slower than for the run with two-stage collimation scheme, whereas the one for beam 1 stayed practically on the same level. An interesting observation is that the beam 1 to beam 2 background ratio was inverted - rate for beam 1 was higher than for beam 2 by factor of about 2. Also

Figure 4: Spatial distribution of protons captured from non-colliding bunches during the run 363469 (LHC Fill 7284). Presented data were collected between luminblocks 130 and 175 (13:25:10 - 14:10:16). Bunches nr 462 and 520 on beam 1 and 2, respectively, were injected as non-colliding ones.

the differences between trigger rate values from each detector on beam 1 is much higher than the values for beam 2 and for two-stage collimation as well. Another conclusion is that there is no beam-related background optimisation improvement for beam 1 as the rise time of the background is almost the same. On the contrary, there is a visible strong reduction of the background rate for the beam 2 - roughly by a factor of 4. This is a very interesting fact which is a subject of more profound investigations of the Collimation Working Group.

The spatial distribution of hits on non-colliding isolated bunches is presented in Fig. 6. The presented spatial distribution concerns only the first 45 minutes of data-taking to make the plots comparable with the plot from previous section. For beam 1, the distributions look similar to the one obtained using the two-stage collimation. The pattern generated by beam 2 (SIDE A) looks interesting, as the shape is similar to patterns from the elastic events [23]. However, its origin should not be the elastic protons, since for non-colliding bunches such are improbable. This pattern was unexpected and requires further investigation.

The offline analysis showed that for the colliding bunches the irreducible elastic background reached the level of 1.5%. The tree times higher elastic background for the runs using crystal collimation scheme could be explained on basis of the shape of the patterns from non-colliding bunches. The scheme was optimised to suppress only the background rate and no optimisation for the spatial distribution was done.

## 6 Summary

After almost one year of preparation, data-taking with forward detectors at the injection energy and high \(\beta^{*}\) was possible. Initial tests showed an unmanageably high background. Situation improved when two new collimation schemes were used. It was observed that background can be reduced to the acceptable levels. For runs where the two-stage collimation was used, the background growth in rate forced a beam re-scraping roughly every hour. The beam-related background pattern looked similar on both sides of the IP. The growth of the beam 2 trigger rates while using crystal collimators was much slower. Due to low background rate growth re-scraping was not required for over three hours of the data-taking. However, the background rate observed in the offline analysis was about 3 times higher with crystal collimation (1.5% as opposed to 0.5%).

Both schemes were checked to suppress the background rate, but without optimising its spatial distribution. The latter one is an important ingredient worth trying to be optimised. The settings could be further improved for the next data-taking in LHC Run 3. The asymmetry in the beam-related background pattern requires further investigation.
