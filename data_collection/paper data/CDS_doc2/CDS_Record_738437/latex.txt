### Jet Reconstruction

Two reconstruction algorithms have been considered so far in ATLAS. The first is a standard cone algorithm. Each calorimetric tower with an energy deposit greater than 2 GeV is used as seed. Then, all the calorimetric towers in a cone of \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}=0.7\) are associated to the protojet and the centroid is calculated. The procedure is iterated until a stable cone axis is found. Since the obtained jets can overlap, a split and merge procedures follows: jets with an overlapping energy greater than 50% are merged together. In this case, the final jet has a precise geometrical shape.

Also the \(K_{T}\) algorithm has been considered. For each calorimetric tower \(i\), the distance with a generic tower \(j\) is calculated as follows:

\[d_{ii}=K_{Ti}^{2}\] \[d_{ij}=\min(K_{Ti}^{2},K_{Tj}^{2})\Delta R_{ij} \tag{1}\]

where \(K_{T}\) is the transverse momentum with respect to the jet axis. If the minimum distance is \(d_{ii}\) the jet has been found, else the \(i\)-th and \(j\)-th towers are merged together. The procedure is iterated. The jets resulting from the \(K_{T}\) algorithm don't have a precise geometrical shape and they don't overlap.

### Jet Calibration

To obtain the correct parent parton energy, jets need to be calibrated because of detector (\(e/\pi\), inefficiencies) and physics (ISR,FSR) effects. A calibration "a la H12" has been used in ATLAS. The energy deposits in the cells of a calorimeter region \(i\) are corrected by a factor which depends on the calorimetric sample \(i\) and on the energy deposit itself. The number of the longitudinal calorimetric samples used is 3 in the central (\(|\eta|<1.7\)), 3 in the intermediate (\(1.7<|\eta|<3.2\)) and 2 in the forward (\(3.2<|\eta|<5\)) regions[3]. To disentangle detector and physics effects the reference energy is that of the MonteCarlo jet, obtained running the reconstruction algorithm on the KINE particles at the generator level. Consequently, the procedure should correct for detector effects only, and should be insensitive to the physics distributions.

The weights \(w_{i}\) of the samples have been parametrized as:

\[w_{i}=a_{i}\oplus e^{b_{i}E_{i}} \tag{2}\]

where \(E_{i}\) is the energy deposit in the sample \(i\) and \(\oplus\) denotes a quadraticsum. The parameters \(a_{i}\) and \(b_{i}\) have been obtained minimizing the \(\chi^{2}\):

\[\chi^{2}=\sum_{e}\sum_{i}\frac{(w_{i}E_{i*}-E_{MCe})^{2}}{E_{MCe}}=\sum_{e}\sum_{ i}\frac{((a_{i}\oplus e^{b_{i}E_{i}})E_{i*}-E_{MCe})^{2}}{E_{MCe}} \tag{3}\]

Once the weights have been obtained, the resolution and the linearity of the jet calibration can be checked. This has been done both for generic QCD and SUSY events, obtaining similar results. The linearity and the resolution at \(E_{T}\) are defined as the mean value and the RMS of the distribution of \(E_{rec}/E_{MC}C\). As can be seen in Figure 1 the linearity is within \(\pm 2\%\) if the low \(E_{T}\) region is excluded for both \(K_{T}\) and cone algorithms, while the resolution is slightly better for the \(K_{T}\). The fitted resolution is

\[\frac{\sigma}{E_{T}}=\frac{76\%}{\sqrt{E_{T}}}\oplus 3\% \tag{4}\]

All the results presented so far have been obtained without including the electronic noise in the simulation. Figure 2 shows the linearity and resolution in presence of noise. A worsening of both linearity and resolution is observed. Better results should be obtained when 3D clustering will be available (up to now, the reconstruction software allows only for two dimensional clustering, _i.e._ clustering following projective towers, with no segmentation in the radial dimension).

## 3 \(\mathbb{E}_{\tau}\) Reconstruction and Measurement

The precision on the \(\mathbb{E}_{\tau}\) measurement is one of the most important issues to reconstruct events with neutrinos in the final state (SM \(H\to\tau\tau\), MSSM \(A/H\to\tau\tau\), for example) and to study physics beyond the standard model. In \(\tau\tau\) final states, for instance, assuming \(M_{\tau}=0\) and neutrino decay direction coincident with the \(\tau\) flight direction in the \(\tau\tau\to p_{1}p_{2}\nu_{1}\nu_{2}\) (where \(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\) are generic particles), the resolution on the \(\tau\tau\) invariant mass turns out to be

\[\sigma(M_{\tau\tau})\propto\frac{\sigma(\mathbb{E}_{\tau})}{\sin(\Delta\phi)_ {p_{1}p_{2}}} \tag{5}\]

The \(\mathbb{E}_{\tau}\) is reconstructed using all the calorimetric cells and summing up the measured transverse momentum of the muons. The calibration weights obtained for the jet calibration have been used. Figure 3 (left) shows the sigma of the two components of \(\mathbb{E}_{\tau}\) as a function of the total transverse energy. The results are shown both for \(A\to\tau\tau\) and for \(Z\to\tau\tau\) samples. The results obtained at the time of the ATLAS TDR[1] in the presence of noise are reported also. Nevertheless, a direct comparison cannot be done, because a more sophisticated cell calibration, taking into account the owner cluster type, was used in the latter case.

\[\Lambda=\sum_{i}E_{Ti} \tag{6}\]

where the index \(i\) refers to the generic cell, it can be shown that

\[\sigma(\mathbbm{E}_{\star})=k\sqrt{\Lambda} \tag{7}\]

The fit to the data shows that \(k\simeq 0.47\) (with \(\Lambda\) expressed in GeV).

## 4 Hadronic \(\tau\) reconstruction

The jets coming from the hadronic \(\tau\) decay have a peculiar shape which allows for hadronic \(\tau\) identification. The \(\tau\)-jets have a low track multiplicity (1 and 3 \(\tau\)-prong decays). Moreover the radius of the cluster in the EM calorimeter is expected to be lower than for light jets and the energy is concentrated in a narrow cone.

For the \(\tau\) identification a likelihood approach is used. The likelihood function used takes into account the number of tracks in the tracker, the shape of the energy deposit in the calorimeters, the impact parameter of the tracks. The efficiency of the \(\tau\) jet identification has been studied on a MonteCarlo sample of \(A\to\tau\tau\) events, while the rejection against light jets has been evaluated using generic QCD events. Figure 3 (right) shows the expected performance of \(\tau\) identification against the rejection of light jets, both with and without electronic noise added. In the case with electronic

noise, a \(2\sigma_{noise}\) cut on the cells has been applied. As can be noticed, the effect of the introduction of the electronic noise is small, in particular at very high \(P_{T}\).

## 5 Conclusions

The preliminary studies performed by the ATLAS Jet/Etmiss group on the expected reconstruction performances of jets, \(\mbox{$\mathrm{E}_{\tau}$}\) and \(\tau\) have been reported. Even though the reconstruction software is still under developement, the present reconstruction can achieve a resolution on the jet energy of \(80\%/\sqrt{E_{T}}\) with a linearity of \(\pm 2\%\). The precision of the \(\mbox{$\mathrm{E}_{\tau}$}\) reconstruction is around \(47\%\sqrt{\sum\mbox{$\mathrm{E}_{T}$}}\) slightly dependent of the kind of physics events studied. Finally, the hadronic \(\tau\) reconstruction algorithms show a very high rejection against light jets, with a low dependance on the noise.

The results presented here are expected to improve when the final reconstruction software will be available.
