## 1 Introduction

The destination of the Forward Region is to extend calorimetry \(\eta\) coverage realizing the possibility to study physics channels having \(E_{T}^{miss}\) or high energy jets in the forward direction as a signature.

The requirement for \(\eta\) coverage to be at least up to 4.5 is considered essential for \(E_{T}^{miss}\) measurements as well as for forward jet tagging. First and foremost in this note we want to evaluate the variation of the calorimetry performance in the vicinity of its limiting \(\eta\) in the present ATLAS design employing integrated LAr forward calorimeter.

The requirement for the jet resolution to be below 10% seems quite moderate for the End Cap ( EC) and Forward (FC) calorimeters themselves. The critical point here is the transition region (crack) between calorimeters. In the contemporary design the forward calorimeter is integrated into the endcap cryostat and the crack seems to be negligible. But it does exist since the calorimeters represent two completely different geometries and employ materials with essentially different properties. Besides, FC is much shorter (in space, not in \(\lambda\)!) than EC and it begins more than one meter farther from the interaction point. Recently approved support structure for FC foresees that EC and FC calorimeters are separated by aluminium cylinder, which, of course, just deepens the crack.

Thus, the second intention of these studies is to estimate the degradation of the calorimetry performance in the crack region.

Similar simulations were made recently by Arizona group on the level of simplified description of the detectors using mixture approach (see [1]). The present results are based on the full scale ATLAS MC with the forward region described in detail. The results of these two approaches can be compared.

Simulation tools, geometry

The calculations were made utilizing DICE 2.03 ( presently on "dev" area) with GEANT 3.21 + FLUKA. The geometry selections were the same as those in "TP0" ATLAS datacards. The detailed geometry description of the Forward Region (currently implemented in DICE and used in these studies) can be found in [2]. The discription of the transition region between FC and EC was modified on the user's level to reflect the status of the current design being in preparation for the Technical Proposal. The outer radii of FC segments were increased by \(\thicksim\)6 cm at the expense of EC dimensions and amounted to 45, 49 and 53 cm for the 1-st, 2-nd and 3-rd segment correspondingly. The Z position of the segments was shifted by 4.5 cm farther from interaction point. To more realistically estimate the effect of support structure 6 mm aluminium cylinders were added between FC and Had EC modules. Besides, clearance between FC and EC filled with LAr was increased from 5 to 9 mm. This was done also by reducing EC segments. The cut-view of the forward region as it was described in these simulations is shown in Fig. 1 (vertical scale is expanded by factor of 6 as compared to horizontal one).

To generate jets PYTHIA 5.7 / JETSET 7.4 were used.

## 3 Calibration of the calorimeters. Response and resolution vs energy

It was assumed that intrinsic resolutions of EC and FC calorimeters are superior for Forward Region and no serious attempt was made in these studies to improve them, e.g. applying

Figure 1: Cut view of the Forward Region

complicated calibration schemes. The calibration coefficients were derived from the requirement of equal response for electrons and pions in energy range \(100\div 200\) GeV. The calibration constants for all hadronic segments of each calorimeter (4 in EC and 2 in FC) were assumed to be equal.

For the FC the response and resolution as a function of energy for electrons and pions was evaluated. Particles were impinging the calorimeter in \(\eta\) window \(3.6\div 4.2\). The results are presented in Fig. 2.

Nonlinearity of electrons' response at low energies have to be attributed to the effect of passive material in front of the calorimeter. It amounts up to almost two Xo (cryostat walls, excluder, polyethylene block, 1-st aluminium support disk).

The deviations from linearity for pions are partially caused by passive material in front of the calorimeter (0.5 \(\lambda\)), and partially by noncompensation effect. The contributions of both effects are roughly equal. For intrinsically essentially noncompensated LAr FC one could expect much more significant deviations from linearity and worse energy resolution for pions. But owing to FLUKA, the FC turned out to be almost compensated (e/h about \(1.05\div 1.08\), only in MC, of course). Thus the results for pions should be considered optimistic. The problems of compensation and its influence upon the response linearity and the hadronic resolution should certainly be separately scrutinized.

Figure 2: Normalized response and resolution for pions and electrons in the forward calorimeter as a function of energy.

Response and resolution of single particles vs \(\eta\)

Samples of 100 GeV electrons and pions distributed uniformly in \(\eta\) region \(2.7\div 5.5\) were generated. The response variation with \(\eta\) is illustrated by means of two plots:

- two dimensional distribution with \(\eta\) along horizontal axis and response of events along vertical one. It characterizes response roughly and, at the same time its dispersion at various \(\eta\) and

- mean response as a function of \(\eta\).

As a "resolution" r.m.s./mean of corresponding distributions were taken.

### Electrons

The response distribution vs \(\eta\) is plotted in Fig. 3. The effect of EC-FC crack at \(\eta=3.2\) is visible as a small (\(\sim\,7\div 9\%\)), narrow (\(\sim\)0.1 in \(\eta\)) pit in the mean response (see also Fig. 4) and some leap in the resolution (Fig. 5).

At \(\eta\sim 4.5\) the mean response starts to decrease arriving to 50 % at \(\eta\sim 4.8\).

### Pions

The response distribution vs \(\eta\) is plotted in Fig. 6.

In the sample (4263 events total) 1 event contained pion decayed in flight before the calorimeters. There are 3 other events with a very low energy deposition. Longitudinal shower profile indicates that one of them corresponds to the late shower development, one

Figure 5: Resolution for 100 GeV electrons as a function of \(\eta\).

is like M.I.P. and one shows quite typical profile. To avoid sharp leaps of the points on the resolution graph these 4 events were exempted later from the sample.

As against electrons, one can see though quite rare, suprisingly large amplitudes below \(\eta=5\). These events originate from the interactions in the cryostat walls (those, which are parallel to the beam line, in Fig. 8 visible as a bump starting at 4.5 and continuing as a tail after 4.8). Due to much broader showers they can deposit considerable part of the energy in the FC. Such interactions can sometimes imitate higher \(E_{T}\), than the original particle possessed (Fig. 7). Although this effect of "acquired" \(E_{T}\) manifests itself at small angles, it can be potentially dangerous by increasing pile-up \(E_{T}\) fluctuations.

The crack zone looks wider than that for the electrons, but with a similar fall in the mean response (see also Fig. 9). Fig. 8 shows that calorimetry material thickness in this region oscillates from \(\sim\)8.7 to 14 \(\lambda\). The drop below 9 \(\lambda\) does not seem to be disturbing and can be reduced by careful EC-FC transition design. The resolution remains at a reasonable level below 10% up to \(\eta=4.6\). The crack effect is hardly noticeable (Fig. 10).

## 5 Response and resolution of 1 TeV jets as a function of \(\eta\)

To evaluate the response for jets we generated small samples of double jet events initiated by light quarks of 1+1 TeV energy.

### Generation, selection and reconstruction of jets

The events were preprocessed so, that for GEANT simulation only particles inside \(\eta-\phi\) cone 0.5 around one of the jets' direction were retained. This direction was found by means of LUND package LUCELL algorithm. Energy of muons and neutrinos was not accounted in the energy of generated jet. Usage of such purified "jets" gave us a chance to drop many questions concerning correct reconstruction of jet energy and direction and concentrate on the study of calorimetry performance instead. As a "generated jet direction" an \(E_{T}\) weighted baricenter of survived particles was assumed.

In each event sample the direction of the jet initiating partons was fixed in \(\eta\) and randomized in \(\phi\). At that the \(\eta\) distributions of the generated jets (accounted on the particle level after the just described procedure was applied) revealed a maximum at the \(\eta\) of primary parton and long tails on both sides. Only jets in the \(\eta\) interval \(\pm 0.1\) around the maximum were retained for the further analysis. The r.m.s. of the \(\eta\) distribution for jets survived after these selections was equal to \(\sim~{}0.01\). If the generated jet energy was less than 0.8 TeV the event was rejected.

The \(\eta-\phi\) cone used to reconstruct jets in the calorimeters was chosen equal to 0.5, i.e. the same as the one applied on the jet preparation stage. In these studies we exploited ATRECON jet reconstruction algorithm with some modifications. One of them was introduced to take into account the fact, that for high pseudorapidities the size of hadronic shower becomes comparable to the \(\eta-\phi\) jet reconstruction cone size. To recover considerable part of the leaking energy the boundary of the cone projected on X-Y plane was extended: an additional band, surrounding cone projection was added. The band has fixed width in X-Y coordinates, and its value should be chosen as a compromise between pile-up and jet resolution, and perhaps, could be separately optimized for each longitudinal segment of the calorimeter. Fig. 11 shows the \(E_{T}\) resolution as a function of the extension band width for two \(\eta\). The width was defined in the X-Y plane positioned in the middle of the FC. The value chosen for present studies was 10 cm (which corresponds to one \(\lambda\) in tungsten).

### Response and resolution

The examples of normalized energy response for jets directed to \(\eta\sim 3.2\) (middle of the crack), 3.5 and 4.5 are shown in Fig. 12. We can't possibly study the tails of distributions at this level of statistics accumulated and it would likely be a relevant task for mixture techniques [1].

The mean response and resolution for jets as a function of \(\eta\) are shown in Fig. 13 and 14. Both E and \(E_{T}\) data presentations are used, since the last one reflects also the quality of direction measurements. \(E_{T}\) of the jet was defined as a vector sum of \(E_{T}\)'s of individual cells belonging to the jet. To calculate the cell polar angle it was supposed that energy is always deposited in the middle (along Z) of each calorimeter longitudinal segment. Afterwards this point was projected onto \(\eta-\phi\) matrix. No attempt to optimize this simple procedure was made. For \(E_{T}\) calculations and jet reconstruction \(\eta-\phi\) granularity of the calorimetry \(0.1\times 0.1\) was assumed (the effect of coarser granularity will be discussed later).

Figure 13: Normalized response for 1 TeV jets as a function of \(\eta\). For comparison response of full calorimetry system is shown. (Statistical errors are by far less than point size.)

As expected, the response for jets shows some dip in the crack zone and keeps above 90% up to the \(\eta\ \sim\ 4.5\). The resolution curve reveals smooth wide bump around the crack, but is well below 10% up to the \(\eta\sim 4.5\div 4.6\).

Let's firstly consider the behaviour of \(E\) resolution in case of full calorimetry response. Comparing it to the single particle resolutions ( Fig. 5,10) one would hardly expect such a wide maximum around the crack. Not only the particles' resolution itself is likely to contribute to the jet's one, but the nonuniformity of the mean response as well (Fig. 4, 9). Since a jet consists of many particles scattered over a wide \(\eta\) zone its response fluctuates depending on the total energy of particles hitting the crack (where their response is suppressed). The same explanation may be employed to understand relatively fast deterioration of the jet resolution at \(\eta>4.1\). Though single particle resolution remains practically stable up to \(\eta\ \sim 4.5\), the jet, directed to this \(\eta\) contains particles scattered up to \(\eta\sim 5\). One can try to improve the jet resolution in these \(\eta\)-regions introducing \(\eta\)-dependent calibration (separately for e.m. and hadronic calorimeter segments) to flatten as much as possible the response to single particles 1. But, at this, the \(\eta\) granularity should be fine enough in the crack region to follow narrow pit in the response (especially in the e.m. sections of the calorimeters).

Footnote 1: Such a calibration on the level of individual calorimetry cells though very attractive is not quite trivial and requires separate studies and, perhaps some optimization on the hardware level. But what will be certainly needed is a recalibration of the jet response to avoid another significant contribution to the jet resolution around the crack and large underestimation of the jet energy (it is even difficult to express it in terms of ”resolution”) at \(\eta\leq 4.3\). This recalibration does not require fine \(\eta\) granularity owing to the high accuracy of the jet direction reconstruction as it will be shown later.

#### 5.2.1 Jet containment in the reconstruction cone

Another contribution to the jet resolution originates from incomplete hadronic shower containment in the jet reconstruction cone (under the "cone" here and thereafter we shall understand \(\Delta R\ =\ \sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}\,+\ \Delta\phi^{2}}\ =\ 0.5\) region surrounded by a 10 cm extension band). Comparing \(E\) and \(E_{T}\) resolutions one can notice evidently smaller effect of miscontainment for the latter. It can be ascribed to the fact that the energy leaks out of the cone mainly at higher \(\eta\) where its fluctuations are of less importance for \(E_{T}\) measurements due to smaller angle. This asymmetry of the leakage comes from the asymmetry of the jet energy distribution in X-Y coordinates. Even if in \(\eta-\phi\) space it is quite symmetric, in X-Y projection the energy density is enhanced at smaller angles. For the same reason at highest \(\eta\), \(E_{T}\) resolution is less sensitive to the leakage out of the calorimeter in the direction of the beam pipe.

#### 5.2.2 \(\eta-\phi\) granularity: \(E_{t}\) and angular resolution

The next contribution to the jet resolution we shall now discuss originates from a coarse \(\eta-\phi\) granularity. Our goal was to estimate the degradation of the performance when increasing \(\Delta\eta\) from 0.1 to 0.2, which could be relevant value for the Forward Region. The basic concern here is that too coarse (comparable to the jet size) \(\eta\) binning affects the jet angle reconstruction and, thus, \(E_{T}\) measurement: reconstructed angle is biased if true jet direction (accounted on particle level) does not coincide with the center of \(\eta\) bin 2.

On the other hand in the regions with mean response varying noticeably in the limits of a single \(\eta\) division, the reconstructed jet angle 3 becomes correlated (if t the response rises with \(\eta\)) or anticorrelated (if it falls down) to the reconstructed jet energy 4. In the case of correlation \(E_{T}\) resolution becomes worse, but it improves as anticorrelation takes place. It means that the \(E_{T}\) resolution can depend not only on the size of \(\eta\) cell, but on the behaviour of the mean response inside \(\eta\) bin and thus, on the arrangement of \(\eta\) divisions. In other words in the crack region we can expect different results for two types of \(\eta\) divisions (\(\Delta\eta\)=0.2): \(\eta_{i}=...,3.0,3.2,3.4,...\), let's call it "type 1", and \(\eta_{i}=...,2.9,3.1,3.3,...\) having a shift by \(\frac{\Delta\eta}{2}\) ("type 2"). For instance, for the sample of jets clustered around \(\eta\)=3.2 the corresponding correlation coefficient turned out to be \(q_{corr.}^{E\,vs\,\Theta}=-0.6\) for division "type 1" and \(q_{corr.}^{E\,vs\,\Theta}=+0.3\) for "type 2". In the first case the \(E_{T}\) resolution improves (5.0%) as compared to the \(E\) resolution (6.2%) and even to the \(E_{T}\) resolution at \(\Delta\eta\)=0.1 (5.7%). At the same time the positive correlation indicates deterioration of \(E_{T}\) resolution (7.0%).

Footnote 3: to be precise: \(\Theta_{reconstr.}^{jet}/\Theta_{particles}^{jet}\)

Footnote 4: to be precise: \(E_{reconstr.}^{jet}/E_{particles}^{jet}\)

To make our estimates for \(\Delta\eta=0.2\) less influenced by \(\Theta-E\) correlations and by nonuniformity of jet's distribution in \(\eta\) we processed each event sample twice: for "type 1" and "type 2" \(\eta\) divisions. The significant difference was found only around the crack. We present here the values derived from the combined distributions as averaged result s. In such a way we compared \(E\), \(E_{T}\) and angular resolutions for \(\Delta\eta=0.1\) and 0.2.

The deterioration of \(E_{T}\) resolutions is illustrated in Fig. 15. The maximum effect is observed at smallest \(\eta\) and amounts to \(\sim\)20% worsening in the resolution.

To better understand the origin of the \(E_{T}\) resolution deterioration we separately studied the degradation of jet polar angle reconstruction accuracy caused by increased (\(\Delta\eta=0.2\)) granularity. Fig. 16 shows angular resolution for jets as a function of \(\eta\) for two \(\eta-\phi\) granularities. The angle was defined as \(\Theta=arcsin(E_{T}^{jet}/E^{jet})\). Resolution characterizing \(\Theta_{recon\,str.}^{jet}/\Theta_{particles}^{jet}\) can not be considered as a direct contribution to \(E_{T}\) jet resolution in the regions of variable response due to the correlations discussed above. Though presented for \(\Delta\eta=0.2\) as "averaged" over two types of \(\eta\) divisions, it helps to estimate the share of the angle mismeasurement in the jet \(E_{T}\) resolution even there.

To further trace the contributions to the jet angular mismeasurement in different \(\eta\) regions we studied angular resolutions for single 100 GeV pions and electrons distributed uniformly in \(\eta\). The conclusion is that in case of pions the shower is sufficiently wide to allow precise direction measurement, no significant difference between \(\Delta\eta=0.1\) and 0.2 was found: for both of them angular resolution is \(\sim\)2% in the EC and in the middle of FC. In the crack region the \(\Theta\) resolution reveals wide (\(2.9\div 3.5\)) bump up to 5%. Electrons, on the contrary, are almost uninfluenced by the crack, but granularity 0.2 worsens the \(\Theta\) resolution from 2 to 4% at smallest \(\eta\), which gradually goes down to 2.5% at \(\eta~{}\geq~{}4\), where the \(\eta\) cell size becomes again comparable to the electromagnetic shower size. No significant difference between granularities 0.1 and 0.05 for electrons was found. These results explain the behaviour of angular resolution for jets: 0.2 granularity affects mainly the \(\pi^{\circ}\) component of the jet (\(\sim~{}1/3\)) at smaller \(\eta\)'s, while the crack effect should be attributed basically to hadrons.

The conclusion which could be drawn from the comparison of Fig. 14, 15 and 16 is that for \(\Delta\eta~{}\leq~{}0.2\)\(E_{T}\) resolution seems not to be dominated by the angle mismeasurement and remains quite acceptable at least for \(\eta~{}\geq~{}2.7\).

As far as the jet energy resolution is concerned, too coarse \(\eta-\phi\) granularity may result

Figure 16: Angular resolution for 1 TeV jets as a function of \(\eta\)

in some increase in the jet containment fluctuations. For \(\Delta\eta=\Delta\phi=0.2\) and the jet reconstruction cone 0.5 the effect was found to be negligible: \(E\) resolution becomes worse by a few per cent (relatively) only at an average as compared to \(\Delta\eta=\Delta\phi=0.1\).

## 6 Summary

The Forward - EndCAP transition region around \(\eta=3.2\) does not seem to greatly spoil the Forward Region performance: both \(E\) and \(E_{T}\) resolutions for 1 TeV jets do not exceed 6% value.

As far as \(\eta\) coverage is concerned the jet reconstruction seems quite feasible up to \(\eta=4.5\div 4.6\).

Calorimetry granularity \(\Delta\eta=0.2\) slightly spoils \(E_{T}\) resolution for 1 TeV jets basically at smaller \(\eta\) (factor 1.2 at \(\eta\sim 2.7\) as compared to \(\Delta\eta=0.1\)). Nevertheless, the \(E_{T}\) resolution remains below 10% up to the \(\eta\ \sim\ 4.6\). Angle mismeasurement, though in some cases nonnegligible, does not dominate in \(E_{T}\) resolution for \(\Delta\eta=0.2\) up to the highest pseudorapidities. In the crack region, if necessary, one can try to benefit from finer granularity recalibrating particle response and thus recovering in the resolution for jets.

Of course, more realistic design of the forward calorimeter support structure, cryostat, beam equipment can somewhat affect the Forward Region performance. After the corresponding corrections are introduced in DICE it would be worth coming back to the Forward Region again.
