Abstract

This note gives an overview of the ATLAS physics selection strategy for the initial running period of LHC and an assumed maximum luminosity of \(2\cdot 10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). We present various contributions to the trigger menu, ranging from inclusive and unprescaled physics triggers, through prescaled physics and monitoring triggers, to pure calibration and monitoring triggers. We also try to give motivations for the various choices of trigger items where appropriate and useful.

Introduction

This note summarizes ideas about trigger menus for the very first LHC running, i.e. for a maximal luminosity of 2\(\cdot\)10\({}^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). Several different types of information are collected:

* In Section 2 we discuss the general physics trigger menu as intended for collecting the bulk of data to be used for physics analyses. The selection is presented in terms of the LVL1 and HLT signatures in an obvious notation already well familiar to ATLAS. Where possible information on the expected rates is also provided, together with a short comment on what the main purpose of the signature is. All triggers mentioned in this menu are unprescaled, most of them representing inclusive selections, and the thresholds mentioned are compromises between efficiency and background rejection.
* In addition to the general menu just mentioned, a few additional signatures with increased thresholds and flagged as 'high priority' are meant to be particularly sensitive to high-\(p_{T}\) objects. In Section 3 these additional signatures, together with the general information from Section 2, are presented. It is assumed that the total rate for this detailed menu is the same as for the general menu of Section 2 since the signatures with increased thresholds are included already.
* There exist, however, a large number of triggers which will either be prescaled (due to their high rate or because they select less interesting physics channels) or which do not primarily serve for collecting data for physics analyses, but provide monitoring and calibration data. They might also be used for trigger efficiency determinations. These triggers are shown and discussed in Section 4, together with first ideas on necessary sample sizes. In the Section 4 we also present more exclusive signatures (either prescaled or unprescaled) which serve for selecting well-defined signatures which, assuming sufficiently low threshold values, have too high rates in more inclusive triggers. These exclusive signatures are primarily foreseen for triggering new physics processes or B events.

The information collected in this note comes from various sources, mainly the LVL1 TDR [1] and various talks given at ATLAS physics workshops or LHCC sessions [2, 3, 4]. An earlier effort for defining ATLAS trigger menus can be found, for example, in [5].

In an appendix we present in addition some of the feedback provided by the physics working groups in response to the first proposal of the trigger menus in this note (see [6] for an example of the feedback). As a reaction to this feedback, some items in the menu have changed or might still change in the near future.

The impact of the trigger menus shown in this document on the requirements for the LVL1 trigger system is discussed in a separate document [7]. The emphasis there is on the number of input bits to the CTP (or 'thresholds') and, even more, on the the number of available LVL1 output signals (or 'trigger items' in LVL1 nomenclature). It is assumed that this document may influence the final design of the CTP.

The General Physics Menu

In this section we show, in Table 1, a general trigger menu intended for initial LHC running at a peak luminosity of 2\(\cdot\)10\({}^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). This trigger menu contains only unprescaled (inclusive) triggers to be used directly for physics purposes (no calibration, monitoring or other technical triggers). Where available, we tried to gather information about the rates to be expected at LVL1 and in the HLT. In addition, a short comment illustrates the purpose of the trigger.

The content of Table 1 is a compilation of information gathered for recent presentations at conferences and at the LHCC [2] and, especially for the LVL1 signature parts, from the ATLAS LVL1 trigger Technical Design Report (TDR) [1]. The menus shown here aim for total rates of 25 kHz (LVL1) and 200 Hz (HLT)1 at peak luminosity, respectively. Assuming a design capability of 75 kHz at LVL1, this would leave room for some additional triggers (B physics, more general physics triggers), especially towards the end of an LHC fill. It must, however, be noted that rate estimates are based on Monte Carlo predictions which might easily be a factor 2 or more off. Therefore, some safety margin should also be planned in. In addition, the inclusion of more triggers should not increase the HLT output rate significantly above 200 Hz in view of the offline computing cost.

Footnote 1: It should be noted that in these estimates the reduced anticipated initial funding has been taken into account so that the given rates are lower than would be desirable from a physics point of view. Please also note that the rates given here do not account for the slight reductions due to dead-time.

The notation in which the signatures are given is familiar to ATLAS since long. The convention is that LVL1 (HLT) signatures are written using capital (small) letters. The required multiplicity of the object in question is given as an integer in front of the string identifying the object, and the discriminating threshold to be applied is given as an integer after this string. The application of isolation criteria is indicated as an attached 'i'.

The main contributions to the menu are single and di-lepton triggers (at LVL1: MU20, 2MU6, EM25i, 2EM15i, and TAU60). These signatures are sensitive to most Standard Model and new physics processes involving known or new W and Z (W',Z') bosons. The thresholds of these signatures have been revised, mainly due to changed (more restrictive) rate constraints on the LVL1 trigger. The total rate at LVL1 is clearly dominated by the single and di-electron triggers; at HLT, the muon and electron final states contribute about 40 Hz each.

For QCD studies within the Standard Model, and for hadronic final states of new physics processes, a number of jet signatures with multiplicities between one and four required jets are provided. The precise definition of the thresholds will be one of the aims of new trigger studies which are just about to start.

From the remaining list, mainly the total transverse energy (indicated as 'E'), the total transverse energy as calculated from all jets ('JE') and the missing transverse energy ('xE') triggers should be mentioned. These provide sensitivity for Standard Model processes but are also an important ingredient for searches for new physics. The mixed signatures, consisting of lepton, jet and/or energy components are in many cases still under discussion, as are their respective threshold values.

The Detailed Physics Menu

In this section, a more detailed menu for unprescaled (mostly inclusive) physics is shown (Tables 2, 3), in which also high-priority triggers with higher thresholds enter, some of them with relaxed isolation criteria. The purpose of these high-priority items is mainly to override the complex dead-time algorithm of the CTP: In order to prevent derandomizers of the front-end electronics from filling up the CTP can be configured such that it accepts only \(N\) triggers in a time interval \(T\), with \(N\) between 1 and 32 and \(T\) in the range 0 to 1.6 ms. More than \(N\) triggers in the interval \(T\) will be rejected, unless they are flagged as 'high priority'.

The rate of this menu is assumed to be the same as for the general physics case, since the higher threshold triggers do not add to the rate2.

Footnote 2: The jet rate decreases quickly with some power of the transverse momentum - an exponent of something like 6 is realistic (see F. Paige’s mail in the appendix). Isolation criteria, on the other hand, have a rejection power of 10 or so. Therefore high-priority items with high sufficiently high \(p_{T}\) thresholds do not contribute to the rate even if only relaxed isolation criteria are applied.

The most prominent additions of the detailed menu with respect to the general menu in Table 1 are the high-threshold electron triggers (LVL1: EM30, 40, 50, 60, 2EM30 with partly relaxed isolation criteria) which are discovery motivated. Additional thresholds are also foreseen for the \(\tau\) final states and the jet and energy triggers.

Prescaled Physics Triggers, Calibration and Monitoring Triggers

There exist a large number of triggers which will be prescaled. These do not primarily serve for collecting data for physics analyses, but provide important monitoring and calibration data or are foreseen for trigger efficiency determinations (for example via a bootstrap method3). These triggers are shown and discussed in this section.

Footnote 3: Starting from a sample of (unbiased) minimum-bias data the efficiency of a given trigger A might easily be determined via the ratio of triggered events to minimum bias events. The efficiency of a trigger B, with higher thresholds than A, can then be determined in a sample of events triggered by A, and so on.

No estimates for rates or prescale factors are given in this section - the optimum choice for these will depend on future studies. However, we try to provide first hints towards the requested size of the data samples for a given signature. This requested size may be driven by considerations about the statistical precision of measurements or efficiency determinations, for example.

Prescaled triggers fall into three categories, all of which are expected to give significant rate contributions (there might also be unprescaled calibration and monitor triggers):

* Prescaled physics triggers: They extend cross-section measuremens to smaller \(p_{T}\) values and might thus also help to understand backgrounds or selections cuts, for example.
* Calibration triggers: These triggers help to select samples of particles with well-known properties, for example Z\(\rightarrow\)ee,\(\mu\mu\), b\(\bar{\rm b}\) or W\(\rightarrow\)jj. Using the known characteristics of these particles one can then use the events to calibrate the detector.
* Monitor triggers: These triggers help to control basic experimental properties like, for example, the vertex position or the luminosity.

In the following, the prescaled triggers given in Table 4 will be grouped in a few categories and motivated (many of the arguments apply equally well to many of the unprescaled inclusive triggers, and some of the examples will explicitly refer to those). In addition we show, in Table 5, a selection of exclusive trigger signatures which will be used to trigger on interesting (new physics) final states which give too high rates with the inclusive triggers with sufficiently low thresholds. The selection of signatures we show is not supposed to be complete but covers only a few channels from the Higgs and SUSY physics programme, and a few others. It should however be kept in mind that the discovery of new physics at the LHC might very well lead to the design of a number of exclusive triggers adapted to the (a priori unknown) corresponding final states.

### Muon Triggers

The prescaled muon triggers will serve a variety of purposes.

\(\bullet\) Using Z\(\rightarrow\mu\mu\) events triggered by di-muon triggers like 2MU10 or 2MU15 helps to understand the momentum scale in the Inner Detector and muon spectrometer.

\(\bullet\) MU6 triggers or other single muon low threshold triggers may be used to study the trigger efficiency using a bootstrap method.

\(\bullet\) Single muon triggers at low thresholds also serve to understand muon reconstruction at low momentum, the energy loss of muons in the calorimeter or the alignment of the inner detector.

\(\bullet\) The question of muon isolation still has to be discussed further.

\(\bullet\) Z\(\rightarrow\)ee,\(\mu\mu\) events will also help with some questions arising from SUSY analyses (flavour subtraction).

\(\bullet\) J/\(\psi\),\(\Upsilon\rightarrow\mu\mu\) events might also be used for mass and energy scale determinations.

### Electron / Photon Triggers

\(\bullet\) Di-electron events Z\(\rightarrow\)ee at all kinds of (also low) thresholds like 2EM10, 2EM15 are essential for the understanding of the calorimeter energy scale and the detector intercalibration. The isolation criteria for these triggers still have to be discussed.

\(\bullet\) Inclusive electron triggers with low thresholds (EM7, EM10, EM15, EM20), like inclusive muon triggers, serve for the determination of trigger efficiencies.

\(\bullet\) Inclusive and di-electron triggers are also needed for the Inner Detector alignment, the understanding of the \(E/p\) and the determination of the reconstruction efficiencies.

\(\bullet\) Single photon triggers may be used to map the material in the ATLAS tracking detectors, to study photon conversions or to investigate the photon reconstruction and detection efficiency.

\(\bullet\) J/\(\psi\) decays to electron pairs may serve the determination of mass and energy scales.

\(\bullet\) Z\(\rightarrow\)ee events will also be used to tune the electron identification.

### (b) Jet Triggers

\(\bullet\) Di-jet events at low thresholds (2J25, 2J35, 2J50, 2J65, 2J90, 2J130) may serve for the detector intercalibration. In addition, they can be used to study jet reconstruction algorithms over the whole \(p_{T}\) range.

\(\bullet\) Jet-plus-photon events may be used for the determination of the absolute jet energy scale.

\(\bullet\) Like in the electron and muon trigger cases, jet triggers with lower thresholds may be used to determine jet trigger efficiencies.

\(\bullet\) In addition, all kinds of jet triggers are vital for Standard Model QCD analyses.

\(\bullet\) Jet events also have to be understood as a major background for many new physics searches.

\(\bullet\) Jet events are further helpful in tuning Monte Carlo generators.

\(\bullet\)\(\mathrm{b\overline{b}H(b\overline{b})}\) events or vector-boson fusion Higgs events \(\mathrm{q\overline{q}H(b\overline{b})}\) require the use of b tags for jets.

### Energy Triggers

\(\bullet\) Samples with reduced cuts on the missing transverse energy or reduced jet multiplicity events are required to understand the background to SUSY studies.

### Mixed and Other Triggers

\(\bullet\) Minimum-bias triggers and random triggers will be used to study the properties of the \(pp\) interaction.

\(\bullet\) Minimum-bias events are also the basis for determining efficiencies of LVL1 triggers via, e.g., a bootstrap method.

\(\bullet\)\(\tau\) or \(\tau+E_{T}^{miss}\) triggers from Z\(\rightarrow\tau\tau\) with one leptonic and one hadronic \(\tau\) decay may be used for general calibration purposes and to test the missing energy scale of the detector.

### Exclusive Triggers

\(\bullet\) Prescaled and unprescaled triggers including forward jets or localized forward energy depositions4 in the FCAL and the endcaps, in conjunction with substantial missing transverse energy, might be used for triggering on invisible Higgs decays.

\(\bullet\) Similarly, fwd jets plus leptons (e,\(\mu\),\(\tau\)) can be used for triggering on Higgs bosons from vector-boson fusion events with the Higgs going W pairs or to \(\tau\) pairs.

\(\bullet\) bb(H\(\rightarrow\)bb) events with four b jets in the final state can be triggered by the LVL1 three- or four-jet triggers and a more exclusive selection on HLT, requiring a number of b-tagged jets. It might be that the LVL1 thresholds have to be adapted for this trigger.

\(\bullet\) Similarly, qq(H\(\rightarrow\)bb) events might be selected using a refined LVL1 four-jet trigger.

\(\bullet\) Lepton-lepton triggers (with two different leptons) might be signs for lepton flavour violation. In addition, fully leptonic top events or H\(\rightarrow\)ZZ,WW events might be selected with them.

\(\bullet\) Jet plus missing energy triggers are used for SUSY searches.

\(\bullet\) Lepton plus missing energy triggers will play a role in improving the acceptance for W\(\rightarrow\)l\(\nu\) events.

\(\bullet\) Muon plus photon events selected at the HLT can be used to detect rare top decays or lepton flavour-violation events.
