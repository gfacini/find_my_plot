###### Abstract

In addition to other radiation, the modules of the ATLAS SCT will be exposed to a flux of thermal neutrons of the order of 10\({}^{13}\) particles/cm\({}^{2}\)/year when the machine luminosity reaches L=10\({}^{34}\)/cm\({}^{2}\)/s [1]. Such low energy neutrons can be captured by isotopes of silicon and boron present in detectors producing known silicon dopants. In addition the readout electronics will see large signals from alpha and beta particles produced in the decays of unstable nuclei. We calculate the rates of two potentially dangerous reactions and we find no apparent threat to the performance of the SCT modules from this source.

## 1 The flux of thermal neutrons

The flux of neutrons in the ATLAS Inner Detector has been calculated by Alfredo Ferrari [1]. Fig.1b, copied from the Inner Detector TDR [2], shows the flux versus neutron energy. Figure 1a represents a magnification of the low energy region using linear scales and the units that are more suitable for low energies. The curve represents the distribution of energy of thermal neutrons, i.e. the neutrons that are in thermal equilibrium with the Inner Detector material.

We expect large rates of thermal neutrons because the Inner Detector contains hydrogen, mainly in the TR material of the TRT and in the moderator plugs in front of forward calorimeters. Collisions with hydrogen nuclei reduce energy of the neutrons and eventually bring them to thermal equilibrium with matter.

Thermal neutrons are included in the calculations done by A. Ferrari using FLUKA. The integral of the distribution shown in Fig.1a is included in the lowest energy point of the distribution in the TDR figure shown here as Fig.1b. The following table shows the neutron fluxes calculated for the four examples of the SCT barrels and wheels:

\begin{tabular}{l l l} _Part of the SCT_ & _Flux of thermal neutrons_ & _Total neutron flux_ \\  & [Particles/cm\({}^{2}\)/year] & [Particles/cm\({}^{2}\)/year] \\
1st barrel & \(1.84\times 10^{13}\) & \(3.31\times 10^{13}\) \\
4th barrel & \(1.83\times 10^{13}\) & \(3.11\times 10^{13}\) \\
1st wheel & \(1.90\times 10^{13}\) & \(3.56\times 10^{13}\) \\
9th wheel & \(2.45\times 10^{13}\) & \(5.06\times 10^{13}\) \\ \end{tabular}

The above figures were calculated using 80 mb for the total cross-section for pp interaction and assuming a nominal LHC year of 10\({}^{7}\) s at L = 10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The statistical precision of the calculations with FLUKA is better than 3% for the above numbers, but the systematic errors are expected to be larger. No quantitative estimate of the systematic error is available, but it is known that even small variations in the concentration of hydrogen can have significant consequences [1]. We therefore think that two digit accuracy in all the following calculations is more than sufficient.

Figure 1: Distribution of energy for thermal neutrons with kT = 25.9 meV (a) and distribution of neutron energies calculated for the TDR [2] (b). Thermal neutrons are included in the lowest energy data point of the TDR plot.

We use the worst SCT case, the rate of thermal neutrons of

\[N_{th}=\ 2.5\times 10^{13}\ \mathrm{particles/cm^{2}/year}\]

in the following sections. The distribution of energy shown in Fig.1a is given by the Maxwell formula

\[\rho\left(E\right)dE\equiv\frac{1}{kT}\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sqrt{\frac{E}{kT}} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{E}{kT}}dE\,\]

here normalized to unity. The characteristic energy scale kT is given by the temperature of matter interacting with neutrons. The hydrogen contained in TRT and in the moderator will play a dominant role in this interaction. Since the hydrogen is approximately at room temperature we have chosen the energy corresponding to T = 300 K, which gives kT = 25.9 meV (mili eV). The average energy of a thermal neutron is \(\frac{3}{2}kT\), while the most probable energy is \(\frac{1}{2}kT\).

## 2 Reaction with boron

The p-type strips of silicon microstrip detectors contain boron at concentrations up to \(5\times 10^{18}\)/cm\({}^{3}\). Boron is known for its large cross-section for the reaction of neutron capture

\[\begin{array}{c}10\\ 5\end{array}\begin{array}{c}1\mathrm{n}\underset{3}{\rightarrow}7\\ 0\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\mathrm{Li}\underset{2}{\rightarrow}4\\ 2\end{array}\alpha\ \.\]

The energy of 2.30 MeV is released in this reaction. It was pointed out several years ago [3] that the alpha particle from this reaction, which carries an energy of 1.47 MeV and deposits it near the production place, is potentially dangerous for the continuous operation of the front-end electronics. The alpha, together with the recoiling lithium, create a signal that is almost 30 times larger than the one of a minimum-ionizing particle and saturates the input amplifier of the front-end readout electronics, blocking the circuit for a time of 1 to 2 us and creating dead time [4].

Also the other product of the reaction, the lithium atom, is potentially harmful as an n-type dopant altering the properties of the detector. In this section we investigate both consequences of the reaction with boron quantitatively.

### Probability of the neutron capture

The cross-section for neutron capture by nuclei varies with neutron energy as

\[\sigma\left(E\right)=\sigma_{{}_{th}}\sqrt{\frac{E_{{}_{th}}}{E}},\]

where \(E_{th}\) is an energy scale constant corresponding to room temperature, in other words \(E_{n}=kT\) for \(T=300\) K, numerically the same as the characteristic energy of the Maxwell distribution described in the previous section. The constant \(\sigma_{{}_{th}}\) is called thermal cross-section. The thermal cross-section for the \({}^{10}\)B(n,\(\alpha\)) reaction is \(\sigma_{{}_{th}}=3838\pm 6\) barns [5]. The abundance of \({}^{10}\)B isotope in boron varies, depending on the sample history, typical abundance is about 20%.

The probability to capture a neutron calculated for a single \({}^{10}\)B nucleus exposed to a flux of \(N_{{}_{th}}\) neutrons per cm\({}^{2}\) can be calculated in the following way:

\[P=N_{{}_{th}}\int\limits_{{}^{+\infty}}^{{}^{+\infty}}\rho\left(E\right)\sigma \left(E\right)dE=\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\,N_{{}_{th}}\sigma_{{}_{th}}\.\]

For a \({}^{10}\)B nucleus exposed to the flux of \(2.5\times 10^{13}\) neutrons/cm\({}^{2}\)/year we calculate the probability of \(P(^{10}\)B(n,\(\alpha\))) = \(1.1\times 10^{-7}\) per one nominal year of LHC operation (\(10^{7}\) seconds at L = \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)).

### Rate of alphas and concentration of lithium

The boron implants are present in the p-type strips. Typically the strips have the maximum possible doping concentration of \(5\times 10^{18}\) boron atoms per cm\({}^{3}\). The following table summarizes the calculation of the rate of alpha particles:

\begin{tabular}{l l l} _Parameter_ & _Value_ & _Comment_ \\ Strip dimensions & 18 \(\mu\)m \(\times\) 2 \(\mu\)m \(\times\) 12 cm & barrel strip as an \\  & & & example \\ Dopant density & \(5\times 10^{18}\) B atoms per cm\({}^{3}\) & maximum possible \\ Abundance of \({}^{10}\)B isotope & 20\% of boron atoms & typical \\ Number of boron nuclei & \(2.2\times 10^{13}\) per SCT strip & \\ Reaction probability & 1.1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-7}\) per year & see section 2.1 \\ Rate of alpha particles & 4.7 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-5}\) per strip per year & \\  & 4.7 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-2}\) per strip per second & \\ Dead time of electronics & 2 \(\mu\)s per alpha & \\ Geometrical factor & \(\sim\)50\% & half of \(\alpha\) go into SiO\({}_{2}\) \\  & & create no signal \\
**Resulting inefficiency** & **4.7 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-8}\)** & dead time as \\  & & fraction of time \\ \end{tabular}

It should be stressed again that in this type of calculation the objective is limited to getting the order of magnitude correct. Many of the above numbers, for instance the neutron flux and the doping concentrations, have uncertainties that are poorly known and potentially large. However, assuming that the saturation times caused by alpha particles are of the order of microseconds, we expect a negligible dead time of the SCT electronics from this source.

The other product of the reaction, the lithium nucleus, will recoil with an energy of 0.83 MeV. It can be estimated that lithium nuclei will travel distances of about 3 microns in silicon [6], creating a zone around each strip doped n-type. The next table summarizes the calculation of lithium concentration around the p-type strips.

\begin{tabular}{l l} _Parameter_ & _Value_ & _Comment_ \\ Recoil distance of \({}^{7}\)Li & \(\sim 3\)\(\mu\)m \\ Dimensions of the region & \(5\)\(\mu\)m \(\times\) 24 \(\mu\)m \(\times\) 12 cm \\ around the strip doped with Li & (factor of 3.3 larger than \\  & the strip) \\ Initial concentration of B in the & \(5\times 10^{18}\) atoms per cm\({}^{3}\) & maximum possible \\ p-type strip & \\ Abundance of \({}^{10}\)B isotope & 20\% of boron atoms & typical \\ Reaction probability & 1.1 \(\times 10^{-7}\) per year & see section 2.1 \\ Geometrical factor & 50\% & half go into SiO\({}_{2}\) \\
**Concentration of \({}^{7}\)Li around the strips after 1 year** & \(1.7\times 10^{10}\) cm\({}^{-3}\) & After 1 year at \\  & & L = 10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) \\ \end{tabular}

The bulk of silicon sensors has n-type dopants with concentrations of the order of 10\({}^{12}\) per cm\({}^{3}\). The concentration of recoil lithium around the strips can only reach levels of 10\({}^{10}\) per cm\({}^{3}\)  after one year of high luminosity LHC operation. We do not expect a significant effect after one year.

In order to predict how lithium will accumulate in several years of the detector lifetime we have to take its drift in electric field into account. Lithium is mobile in the silicon lattice. Drifting Li\({}^{+}\) ions with electric field is used industrially to produce intrinsic material, in which the original p-type material is compensated by the n-type lithium dopants. The measurements of mobility are done at temperatures of 80 to 200 \({}^{\circ}\)C [7], but it is possible to extrapolate them to the temperatures at which the SCT will be operated. We expect the mobility of lithium atoms to be of the order of 10\({}^{-13}\) cm\({}^{2}\)/(Vs). Electric fields of the order of 100 V/cm will be present close to the p-type strips of the SCT detectors. The fields will remain at this high levels even after the type of bulk material is inverted and and the p-n junction moves to the back side of the detectors [8]. From the mobility and from the field strength we can estimate that the lithium atoms around strips will be able to drift distance of the order of 1 \(\upmu\)m per year.

Li\({}^{+}\) ions will be attracted back towards their production place, the p-type strips. With the doping concentrations there of the order of 10\({}^{18}\) per cm\({}^{3}\) the small addition of n-type lithium dopants will not produce a visible effect.

## 3 Reaction with silicon

An isotope of silicon is also able to capture neutrons in the reaction

\[\begin{array}{c}\mbox{$\frac{{}^{30}\,{\rm Si}}{14}$}+\mbox{$\frac{{}^{1}}{0} $}\mbox{n$}\mbox{$\frac{{}^{31}\,{\rm P}}{15}$}+\beta\,\end{array}\]

creating phosphorus in the ensuing beta decay. The abundance of \({}^{30}\)Si is 3% of silicon. The silicon crystal has 5 \(\times\) 10\({}^{22}\) atoms per cubic cm, therefore the concentration of \({}^{30}\)Si is 1.5 \(\times\) 10\({}^{21}\) per cm\({}^{3}\), two orders of magnitude larger than the highest possible levels of doping concentrations.

Phosphorus, the reaction product, is the standard n-type dopant of silicon. The reaction in question is used industrially to produce uniformly doped n-type silicon [9, 10]. In such production process the neutron irradiation is followed by heating of the silicon to temperatures around 800 K, which permits the phosphorus nuclei to occupy positions in the lattice. In the cold conditions of the SCT the \({}^{31}\)P nuclei will remain between the nodes of the lattice and therefore will not become the standard n-type dopants. They will become defects, deep level charge traps, the effect of which is less understood. It is nevertheless interesting to calculate what concentrations of phosphorus will be produced in the SCT sensors.

The cross-section for the \({}^{30}\)Si(n,\(\beta\)) reaction is \(\sigma_{th}=0.107\pm 0.002\) barns [5], with the same energy dependence as in case of the \({}^{10}\)B(n,\(\alpha\)) reaction. The probability of neutron capture can be calculated the same way as in section 2.1. We obtain \(P(^{30}\)Si(n,\(\beta\))) = \(3.0\times 10^{-12}\) per one nominal high luminosity year. This probability, multiplied by the concentration of \({}^{30}\)Si, gives the concentration of phosphorus of

\[\mbox{N}\,(^{31}\mbox{P})\,{=}\,4.5\times 10^{9}\ \ {\rm atoms/cm^{3}}\]

after one nominal year. This is a small concentration compared to the typical dopant density, which is of the order of 10\({}^{12}\) atoms/cm\({}^{3}\) in the bulk of a silicon detector. We therefore expect that the effect of produced phosphorus can be neglected. The small neutron capture cross-section of \({}^{30}\)Si offsets the high density of this isotope in the silicon crystal.

The other product of the reaction is a \(\beta\)- ray of 1.48\(\upmu\)c 0.008 MeV maximum energy [11]. Assuming 300 \(\upmu\)m thick silicon detectors and 80 \(\upmu\)m strip pitch of the SCT, it can be calculated that the rate of \(\beta\) decays will be of the order of 1.3 Hz per electronics channel at a constant luminosity of L = 10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The createdsignals will vary in amplitude depending on location, angle and energy of the beta decay. Some of the signals will be larger than those of minimum-ionizing particles.

With the 2.6 h characteristic time of the \(\beta\) decay it could in principle be possible to see the signals during the time when there will be no collisions, which opens an interesting possibility of registering detector radioactivity with readout electronics. However, the rate of 1.3 Hz is equivalent to the occupancy of only \(3\times 10^{-8}\), which is unlikely to be above the noise level. The specified noise level of the SCT front-end is at \(5\times 10^{-4}\) for the nominal threshold. Noise at test beam conditions tends to cross even high thresholds at rates of the order of \(10^{-5}\), probably as a consequence of poorly understood electronic pickups and e.t.c. It is therefore unlikely, because of other noise, that the SCT electronics installed in ATLAS will be able to see the signals from radiation-induced \(\beta\) decays of silicon isotopes.

## 4 Conclusion

We have studied two potentially dangerous reactions of thermal neutrons with the isotopes present in Si sensors. For the neutron doses expected at LHC we find that none of the products of the studied reactions will have visible impact on the performance of the SCT modules. We think nevertheless that only irradiations of complete SCT modules with thermal neutrons can prove that there is no hazard to module operation. Such irradiations could be possible in nuclear reactors.
