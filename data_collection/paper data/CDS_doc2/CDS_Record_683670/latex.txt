## 1 Introduction

The level 2 muon trigger must reduce the rate of level 1 muon candidates by a factor of about 100. Two thresholds of muon trigger are foreseen: a soft muon trigger (pt \(>\) 6 GeV), to be used in coincidence with other trigger elements and where the majority of the reduction must occur; a hard muon trigger (pt \(>\) 20 GeV), which is designed to be stand-alone, and where a smaller reduction factor of approximately 10 is required. This note presents studies of the rate reduction for the hard muon trigger.

The rate of level 2 muon candidates can be reduced in two ways. Either the transverse momentum threshold must be increased as an inclusive cut, or information from other subsystems can be used to cut on the desired nature of the muon candidate. This note uses the latter approach. Muons from W and Z decays (which can arise via top, or Higgs decay as well as directly), are isolated, whereas muons which come from semileptonic \(\overline{\mathrm{b}}\)b decays (considered to be the background in this note), lie within jets, and so are not isolated. Criteria for choosing isolated candidates are developed using electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter information. The objective is to reduce the background rate to approximately 10%, whilst maintaining as high a signal efficiency as possible. As the algorithms which apply these criteria must also be fast (the level 2 trigger forms a decision in 10 ms), the criteria must be simple and require a minimum of data transfer.

This note describes studies of muon isolation at low ( 10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) and high ( 10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) luminosities. In section 2 the software tools and event samples used are described, and in section 3 the relevant details of the calorimetry are discussed. Section 4 outlines the isolation studies which have been performed, and results are given for low and high luminosity in section 5. Finally, conclusions are given.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:2]

Table 2 tabulates the values for each of the three depth measurements (samplings). Note that the electromagnetic calorimeter offers the potential to resolve energy deposits more finely in both \(\phi\) and \(\eta\).

The electronic readout noise reduces the separation between energy deposition from an isolated muon, and energy deposition from isolated muon + jet, by supplying a constant background to both distributions. Typical rms noise values within the electromagnetic barrel calorimeter range between about 20 - 55 (25 - 70 ) MeV at low (high) luminosity. Noise within the hadron tile calorimeter is negligible, but larger in the liquid argon calorimeter (typically 0.3 to 1.3 GeV at both luminosities). A muon typically deposits about 33 (430) MeV per readout cell inside the inner cone, in the electromagnetic (hadronic) calorimetry.

## 4 Isolation Studies

### Volume of calorimeter information required

A muon track passing through the calorimetry will deposit energy in the cells which immediately surround it. The energy deposited can be contained within some cone of radius R ( = \(\sqrt{\lambda\phi 2+\Delta\eta 2}\) ). If the muon is isolated, then there will be little energy deposited in cells which lie in an outer annulus beyond this. The radii of the inner cone and outer annulus must be determined for both calorimeters at low and high luminosity. Not only does this provide the basis of the isolation studies presented in this note, but this also governs the volume of the data flow from the calorimetry to the level 2 trigger.

Consider first a scenario where no readout noise or pileup has been added to the signal and background events. Figure 1 shows the summed transverse energy contained within a cone of increasing radius about the muon track for signal and background in both calorimeters.

Table 2: Readout cell sizes ( \(\delta\eta\) x \(\delta\phi\) ) for the electromagnetic (ECAL) and hadronic (HCAL) calorimetersReadout cells are measured by their midpoint, such that an increased radius only contains a readout cell if the midpoint is contained. It can be seen that a cone of radius 0.1 (one readout cell), is sufficient to contain the muon energy deposition in the hadronic calorimeter. A radius of 0.07 (one to three readout cells, depending on position), is sufficient for the electromagnetic calorimeter, due to the finer readout granularity. In this scenario, the larger the radius of the outer annulus, the greater the discrimination for isolation. An upper limit of 0.5 is used, as this is the approximate extent of a jet.

#### 4.1.1 Effect of low and high luminosity

Figures 2 and 3 show the summed transverse energy contained within a cone of increasing radius about the muon track for low and high luminosity. Both electronic readout noise and pileup have now been added to the signal and background samples. A cut on the cell measured energy of 3\(\sigma\) has also been applied. It can be seen that the effect of noise and pileup is milder at low luminosity, but marked at high luminosity where the large outer

The errors on each point represent the rms spread of values in that bin. Note that low luminosity readout noise and pileup are included in these event samplesannulus collects extra deposition and thus reduces separation between isolated and non-isolated muons. The radius of the outer annulus is reduced to 0.3 for both calorimeters at low and high luminosity to reduce the effects of the noise and pileup. Section 5 will also determine selection criteria at radii of 0.2 - 0.5, to check that no information is lost with this smaller annulus extent. The radius of the inner cone remains the same in all cases. Table 3 summarises the radii used at low and high luminosity.

The errors on each point represent the rms spread of values in that bin. Note that high luminosity readout noise and pileup are included in these event samples.

### Isolation discriminants

Having chosen the radii of inner cone and outer annulus, there are some obvious variables that can be used in forming isolation criteria;

* No. calorimetry cells in inner cone, outer annulus ( multiplicity )
* Summed transverse energy in inner cone, outer annulus ( deposition )
* Summed transverse energy by depth in inner cone, outer annulus ( profile )
* Thresholds on cell energy ( robustness against noise )

The objective of the study is to maximise signal efficiency whilst reducing the background efficiency to about 10%. To achieve this, a range of values are chosen for the variables above, and those which are most sensitive are looped over in a series of experiments. The signal and background efficiencies are calculated for each experiment. If necessary, the process is repeated with a more optimal set of variable values. This is performed for electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters separately, and together. Figures 4 and 5 show discriminating variables for signal and background, for event samples which include no noise or pileup. The full event samples (pt > 20 GeV for b\(\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) background, pt > 24 GeV for W signal) are used to produce these distributions. Note that the separation between distributions changes when readout noise and pileup are added.

#### 4.2.1 Correlations between discriminants

Obviously there is some correlation between the variables shown in figures 4 and 5. If one were to repeat these studies for a more involved algorithm (e.g. a likelihood analysis), then the amount of correlation between variables becomes important. Appendix A tabulates the correlations between each pair of variables for signal and background. The largest correlations (about 80% for both signal and background), are found between the summed transverse energy in the annulus, and the summed transverse energy difference in the innermost layers between annulus and cone, for the electromagnetic calorimeter. This is unsurprising, as most energy is deposited here. Other correlations are of order 50% or lower, and are generally smaller for the signal than the background. This implies that the set of discriminants used in this study cannot be reduced without some efficiency loss.

The points are background events, and the solid histogram the signal. Both histograms are normalised to the same number of events.

The process was applied to signal and background in both calorimeters in the absence of noise and pileup effects, as an illustration of the performance that might be gained. For a background efficiency of about 10%, a signal efficiency of approximately 88% (95%) was achieved using selections based on hadronic (electromagnetic) calorimeter quantities. For this scenario (i.e. no noise or pileup) no improvement was gained by using selections based on information taken from both calorimeters together. The better discrimination of the electromagnetic calorimeter is due to both the finer readout granularity, and to the better separating power between muons and jets of the transverse energy tested.

### Efficiency dependence on muon pt

The transverse momentum spectrum of muons from the signal and background samples are quite different (figure 6). The signal sample is peaked at about half the \(\mathrm{W}\) mass (40 GeV), whereas the background sample falls steeply. The isolation of muons in the signal sample is constant (only a muon and a neutrino are produced in the decay), but the isolation of muons in the background is dependent on the muon transverse momentum. As the boost of the background b hadrons increases, so too does the average transverse momentum of the muon, which will be boosted closer to the b decay jet. Thus background muons of higher transverse momentum are less isolated. Thus it is important to develop isolation criteria which are a function of muon transverse momentum. Overall selection efficiencies for a particular sample can then be obtained by weighting the pt dependent efficiencies by the pt spectrum.

As the signal and background event samples used are of low statistics, only limited binning is possible. Only four bins can be used if the number of events within each bin is to be kept

It can be seen that the best signal efficiency is obtained when electromagnetic information is used. When information from both calorimeters is combined the background efficiency decreases, at a small cost to the signal efficiency. However, as the background efficiency for the former selection is no more than about 10%, it is recommended to use electromagnetic calorimetry information only and thus decrease the data flow to the level 2 trigger. The selection cuts are detailed in appendix B.

These results were obtained with an outer annulus of radius 0.3. The optimisation process was then repeated on samples with an outer annulus of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.5, to check whether the smaller data flow reduces performance. Results are given in table 9, note that the optimisation uses electromagnetic calorimeter information only. The same trend is observed when electromagnetic and hadronic information is combined. It appears that the performance is reasonably independent of annulus extent at low luminosity. A radius of 0.3 is recommended purely to minimise the data flow needed between the calorimetry and the level 2 trigger.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]

Now the optimal selection depends on the transverse momentum range of the signal one wishes to probe. If one is concerned about signal efficiency at the lowest values of transverse momentum, then the selection which uses information from both calorimeters should be used. If one wishes to optimise signal efficiency at transverse momenta above 30 GeV (which contains the majority of W and Z decays), than the selection which only uses electromagnetic calorimetry information should be used. The overlap between both selections is very high (table 13), so adding hadronic calorimeter information does not add many extra events that would not have been chosen anyway. For this reason, and also to minimise data flow, the latter selection is recommended. Selection cuts for both, however,

### Example: W and bb decays with muonic pt > 24 GeV

As an example of the values of selection efficiency that one could expect, the best selections from and high and low luminosities are taken and weighted by the pt spectrum of W and \(\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) decays, for a transverse momentum greater than 24 GeV. The results are given in table 14. Note that the large error arising from the weight uncertainty is due to the small event sample considered; this error can easily be reduced.

## 6 Conclusions

This note has presented studies of muon isolation, the objective being to reduce the level 2 trigger rate for high pt muons whilst retaining as many of the muons from W and Z decay as possible. Isolation criteria have been developed using information from hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters. Both electronic readout noise and pileup have been simulated in the event samples used to develop these criteria. Best selections are detailed for use at low luminosity and high luminosity running. It appears that a selection which uses only electromagnetic information, and which is binned in pt, gives optimal performance at low luminosity. At high luminosity one can either use a selection consisting of solely electromagnetic, or both electromagnetic and hadronic, information, again binned in pt. The choice depends on the pt region one wishes to optimise efficiency for.

Finally, as an example of the performance that these cuts will produce, muonic W and \(\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) decay efficiencies are calculated for muon transverse momenta greater than 24 GeV. A

signal efficiency of about 98% (91%) is obtainable for a desired background efficiency of approximately 10% in low (high) luminosity conditions.

It must be remembered that these studies have been carried out on event samples of limited statistics. The use of much larger event samples, with muonic transverse momenta greater than 20 GeV, should be considered to improve the precision of these findings.
