## 1 Introduction

Several test beam campaigns have been performed to measure the resolution and efficiency of the fiber detectors. The results of the 2006 measurements confirmed that the fiber trackers are suitable for the anticipated quality of the luminosity measurement [2]. For the main fiber detector a resolution of 25um was obtained at 95% efficiency. For the overlap fiber detectors which will be used for the precise vertical positioning, a resolution better than 15 um was achieved. Both types of fiber detectors are triggered by correspondingly shaped scintillator tiles. The trigger efficiency of the main fibre detectors is a critical parameter since the luminosity measurement is based on an absolute rate measurement. Since any efficiency below 100% is difficult to control and will enlarge the luminosity error, the light yield of the trigger scinitators should be well above the trigger threshold of a few photo-electrons. The overlap detectors which are passed by the halo particles are less sensitive to the trigger efficiency. This note describes the test beam results of several combinations of scintillator coatings, photo-multipliers and fiber bundle light guides with the aim to find the best solution for the ALFA detectors.

## 2 Experimental setup

The trigger tiles consist of 3mm thick scintillator material1 with a side length of 32 mm and a height of 31mm. Apart from the bare scintillator, two coatings have been tested: Aluminum coating and reflective white paint2. The Aluminum coating was used in two versions: coating of the complete tile and only at the lower tile edge.

The scintillation light produced by the traversing charged particle was guided by bundles of clear multi-cladding fibres of 0.5 mm diameter[3] to the photo-multipliers. Two bundles of 250 fibers and 40 cm length were fixed by optical glue[4] on both sides of the trigger tiles. The far end of the bundles was glued in plastic connectors and coupled to the Photo-Multiplier-Tube (PMT)[5]. The 9 mm diameter photo-cathode of the R7400 copes with a single bundle of 250 fibers. A plastic lens in front of the R7401 photo-cathode enlarges the effective photo-cathode size to 14 mm diameter what is sufficient to cover a twin bundle of about 500 fibers. Also the option of a trigger completely made of scintillating fibres was investigated. For this purpose six layers of 0.5mm square scintillating fibers[6] were assembled in the shape of the trigger tile and also used as light guide to the PMT. All bundles were plugged without optical grease to the photo-cathode just by air gaps. These gaps were narrow for all single bundle couplings. The twin bundles were connected by a polished Aluminum tube with a gap of 3 mm to the lens PMT R7401. To couple the bundle of 320 fibers to the R7400 photo-cathode, a Winston cone was made as adapter. All combinations of tile coatings, light guides and PMTs are quoted in table 1. Some of these combinations are shown in figure 1.

The PMT signals were fed into an 8 channel ADC CAEN V265 with 120pC /15 bit high sensitivity and 800 pC/12 bit low sensitivity. A first set of measurements was performed with the preferred high sensitivity range; later data were taken with the lower sensitivity option due to a missing switch. All PMTs were calibrated by a pulsed LED using the 1 photo-electron signal. The light yield measurements in the low and high sensitivity ranges agreed within errors and were finally averaged. The uniformity of the ADC channels was in the range of + -4% and included in the light yield total errors.

The dependence of the light yield on the position where the charged particle traverses the scintillator tile was investigated by track reconstruction using a Silicon telescope. This telescope was composed of three Silicon strip detectors each measuring both projections perpendicular to the beam by 640 micro-strips with a 50\(\upmu\)m pitch. After alignment the internal resolution of the telescope was 15 \(\upmu\)m. The Si-telescope was placed together with two smaller trigger counters on a fixed table downstream of the trigger tiles.

A black box equipped with the various trigger tiles and miniature PMTs was placed on a movable platform to scan the light yield across the tile area. A sketch of the complete test bench is shown in figure 2. The measurements were performed in the DESY test beam area 22 with a 6 GeV electron beam.

## 3 Data taking

Before the data taking, the uniformity of the all ADC channels was measured and all PMTs were calibrated using a pulsed LED. All 1 photo-electron signals were in the range between two and four ADC counts for the low sensitivity data and between 15 and 30 ADC counts for the high sensitivity data. For the data taking in the beam, the black box was filled by different tile-bundle-PMT combinations and data sets of 100.000 triggers were collected. Since the beam size was limited by the trigger counters size of 20 x 20mm2, the scan of the light yield across the full tile area required to move the platform to 4 (X,Y)- positions.

Altogether 8 data sets covering the full tile area with different tile-bundle-PMT combinations were collected. Apart from the 1\({}^{\text{st}}\) data set, the majority of the runs were taken with the low ADC sensitivity.

## 4 Data analysis

The tracks reconstructed by the Si-telescope were used to find the position where the particles hit the trigger tile and the scintillation light was produced. For this purpose, the light yield in terms of photo-electrons was calculated using the raw ADC signal and the corresponding 1 photo-electron signal of the particular PMT. An example of raw ADC spectrum and the resulting light yield for the tile with full Alcoating and twin bundle readout is shown in figure 3.

For the operation of the trigger tiles in the ALFA Roman Pots, three parameters are important: the total light yield, the uniformity, and the edge sensitivity.

The light yield for the bare tile readout by one of the two bundles is shown in figure 4. The scatter plot in fig. 4a indicates the mean light yield per 1 mm2 pixel across the tile area. Fig. 4b histograms show the amount of photo-electrons of all electrons passing this tile. The highest light yield is obtained if the particle traverses the tile opposite to the side where the fiber bundle is fixed. Less light reaches the PMT if the particle hits the tile closer to the bundle-tile interface or at the tile edges parallel to the fiber bundle. A simple explanation for this distribution is the angular coverage for total reflection. Only light which enters the fibers in the angular coverage given by the numerical aperture has a chance to reach the photo-cathode. For the direct scintillation light, this condition is best fulfilled at positions opposite to the bundle.

Figure 3: a) the raw ADC spectrum and b) the light yield in terms of photo-electrons for combination 6.

The total light yield of a white-painted tile readout by 2 single bundles is shown in fig.5. The light yield distribution is rather symmetric with the most light at the central position of the lower edge. It is important, that the minimum light yield at the worst positions does not fall below 50% of the maximum value.

Figure 4: a) the mean light yield as (X,Y)-plot and b) the light yield of all electrons for combination 1 readout by a single bundle on the left side.

Figure 5: a) the mean light yield as (X,Y)-plot and b) the light yield of all electrons for combination 8 readout by 2 single bundles.

For all measured tile-bundle-PMT combinations, the light yields averaged over the tile area are given in table 2. The values for combinations with twin bundles are scaled by a factor 2 to compare values attributed to bundles with same amount of fibers. The total error of the quoted values is typically 15%.

The best combination is clearly the tile with the white, reflective paint coating with about 40 photo-electrons per single bundle. As the measurements with the twin bundle indicate the Al-coating does not enlarge the light yield. The values of bare tiles and tiles with Al-coated edge are at the similar level of about 30 photo-electrons. The tiles made of scintillating fibers, which are also used as light guide bundle, give values slightly below 20 photo-electrons. The twin bundle which is coupled by a large air gap of 3 mm to the lens of the PMT R7401 gives surprisingly small signals. About 50% of the light produced in the scintillator tile and transported in the bundles is not converted to photo-electrons. After the test beam measurements the results were validated by measurements with cosmic particles. The cosmic data quoted in table 2 confirm the test beam results within the errors of 15%.

A compilation of all measurements is shown in figure 6. A combination with a standard Lucite light guide is compared to the flexible bundle options. This configuration was measured before and was confirmed in the 6 GeV electron beam to be the most efficient one with a signal of about 55 photo-electrons, as indicated in figure 6. But this solution cannot be realized within the environmental conditions of the Roman Pots with a secondary vacuum of about 100 mbar. A laboratory test has shown that at the operational voltage of 950V electrical discharges between the PMT pins prevent its application and favor the positioning of the PMTs outside the pot. Due to space restrictions in the tight Pot where already 1460 scintillating fibers are guided to the pixels of 23 MAPMTs, the adequate solution for the light transport is a flexible fiber bundle.

Figure 6: Light yields of all configurations under test.

Since most of the elastically scattered protons are expected in the detector area closest to the circulating beam, the trigger efficiency at the lower tile edge is an important feature. In order to check this behavior, the light yield as a function of the distance to the lower edge was analyzed. An example of such a projection is shown in figure 7. The edge behavior is parameterized by a convolution of a Heaviside function with a Gaussian, which is simplified by:

\[f(y;n,c,\sigma)=\frac{N}{2}\times\left(1+\text{erf}\left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2} \times\sigma}\right)\right)\]

With a = y-c the distance to the tile edge, N the normalization constant and \(\sigma\) the Gaussian edge smearing.

The fit results in an edge smearing of 300um. This poor resolution is a combined effect of three factors: the rather long lever arm of about 50cm from the Si-telescope to the scintillator tiles in the black box, the multiple scattering of the 6 GeV electron beam, and the alignment precision of the tiles in the coordinate system of the Si-telescope. The result of a former test beam measurement was that the trigger efficiency still 100% if the distance to the edge is above 30um [2]. Due to the limited resolution we could not confirm this result.

## 5 Conclusion

A measurement in the DESY test beam with 6 GeV electrons has been performed to evaluate the light yield for the ALFA trigger counters. Several combinations of tile coatings: bare, Aluminum, white paint, with clear fiber bundles and PMTs have been tested. The spatial distribution of the light yield was evaluated by the track reconstruction using a Si-telescope with an internal resolution of 15um. The best result obtained with a Lucite light guide cannot be realized due to discharges between the PMT pins in the pre-vacuum. The next best solution is the coating with white, reflective paint which gives with 40 photo-electrons. Such a light yield is a solid base for 100% trigger efficiency. It allows setting the

threshold in safe distance to the 1 photo-electron dark noise of the PMT. A potential increase of the light yield by a factor ~1.5 can be achieved if the standard R7400 PMT is replaced by the new Hamamatsu SuperBialkali PMT R9880 with 35% quantum efficiency.
