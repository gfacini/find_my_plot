**Abstract**

The results of the b-tagging analysis using low \(\pt\) electrons are presented. The full simulation of both the electromagnetic calorimeter and the tracker of the ATLAS TP model was used. The rejection factor against hadrons about 950 and the rejection factor against gluon jets 75 for b-tagging efficiency about 10% was achieved.

## Introduction

Clearly b-tagging will play an important role in several processes which are expected to be observed at LHC [1]. Among them are:

* Higgs physics in the SM and MSSM sector [2];
* SUSY particle searches;
* top quark physics.

Each of the topics listed above may lead to processes with a b-quark in the final state. The backgrounds from non-b jets for these processes are however very large. The most powerful technique to reject them is b-tagging using vertexing. It has been shown that a b-tagging efficiency of about 50% for a rejection against gluon jets of about 60 can be achieved in ATLAS at low luminosity [3]. To improve the overall b-tagging efficiency soft lepton tags can be used.

## Event Samples

The study presented here was performed using two data samples similar to those described in [4]. The signal data set consisted of roughly 200 \(H\to b\overline{b}\) events with \(m_{H}=80\) GeV, and with each b-quark decaying to an electron (directly or through cascade decay). It was also required that:

* both b-quarks have \(p_{T}~{}>~{}15\) GeV and \(|\eta_{b}|~{}<~{}0.3\);
* at least two electrons be present with \(p_{T}~{}\geq~{}1\) GeV and \(|\eta_{e}|~{}<0.6\).

The background data sample consisted of about 250 \(H\to gg\) events with \(m_{H}=80\) GeV. It was required that:

* both gluons have \(p_{T}~{}>~{}15\) GeV and \(|\eta_{b}|~{}<~{}0.3\).

After the above cuts the final samples contained:

* Signal sample: 168 \(b\overline{b}\) pairs with 291 electrons;
* Background sample: 228 gg pairs with 1912 charged particles.

The \(p_{T}\)-distributions for the electrons from b-quark decays and for the charged particles from the gluon sample are shown in Fig. 1.

The events were processed through a full GEANT simulation of the ATLAS Inner Detector and Barrel Accordion Calorimeter. The electronic noise in the calorimeter was taken into account. The KINE bank information was used only for preselection cuts, and for the a detailed evaluation of the tracker performance. For the rest of the study, the HITS and DIGI bank information was used.

## Track Reconstruction in the Inner Detector

The track reconstruction was performed using XKALMAN[5]. The version used restricts the reconstruction to a limited region of \(\eta-\phi\) space and allows the user to specify the type of the performed track fit among three possibilities:

- a fit without bremsstrahlung (up to two kinks allowed per track);- a fit with bremsstrahlung;

- one of the above depending on the electron identification resulting from the use of the transition radiation information in the TRT.

In this latter case, which was used for the analysis described in this note, the track is treated as an electron track candidate, if the ratio of the number of high-threshold hits to the total number of hits on the track in the TRT is above a given threshold. The high-threshold hits are those with energy deposition above a threshold of \(\sim 6\) keV. The bremsstrahlung fit is used for the electron candidates, and otherwise the standard track-fit is applied. The track-reconstruction efficiency was about 92% for the electrons, and about 90% for the charged particles in the gluon-jet sample.

The distributions of the generated (\(p_{T}~{}>1\) GeV) and reconstructed (\(p_{T}~{}>0.5\) GeV) track transverse momenta are shown in Fig. 1, for the electrons in the b-jets and for all the charged hadrons in the gluon jets. The tracker performance is summarised in Table 1, and in Figs. 2 and 3 for \(\phi\), \(\eta\) and \(p_{T}\).

Based on the numbers in Table 1 and the distributions in Figs. 2 and 3, the following comments can be made:

1. A substantial fraction of non-Gaussian tails is observed in all the distributions. Without bigger statistics and comparable \(p_{T}\)-ranges for electrons and hadrons, it is difficult at this stage to draw any firm conclusions based on these numbers.
2. The expected worse behaviour of electrons in \(R-\phi\) due to bremsstrahlung is observed both for the reconstructed \(\phi\)- and \(p_{T}\)-distributions.

## Reconstruction of Showers in the Accordion Calorimeter

The tracks reconstructed in the inner tracker were extrapolated to the calorimeter front face to define the calorimeter cell with the highest energy deposition. The coordinates of this cell were taken as the shower coordinates. The energy depositions in the two adjacent cells with the highest contributions were then added to that of the central cell, thus defining the core shower energy, \(E_{core}\). Additionally, two larger energy clusters were considered: the 3x3 and the 3x7 cell clusters in \(\eta\times\phi\). All energies were summed over the longitudinal em calorimeter components and the preshower detector.

## Analysis

The analysis was performed by optimizing cuts based on several variables described below; each cut quantity is plotted for the electrons from b-jets and for all charged particles from gluon jets after applied of all previous cuts

* the ratio of the number of high threshold hits on the reconstructed track to the number of all hits on the track in the TRT, plotted for both the electrons from b-jets and all charged particles from gluon jets as shown in Fig. 4 (top);
* the longitudinal shower shape in the calorimeter, which was probed using the variable \(E_{cer1}/E_{cer}\), where \(E_{cer1}\) is the core shower energy deposited in the first longitudinal compartment of the A cordin calorimeter. The distribution of \(E_{cer1}/E_{cer}\) is shown in Fig. 4 (bottom);
* the matching between the \(p_{T}\) reconstructed in the Inner Detector and the core shower energy reconstructed in the A cordin calorimeter, as shown in Fig. 5 (top);
* the lateral shower shape, described by \(E_{3x3}/E_{3x7}\) where \(E_{3x3}\) (\(E_{3x7}\) resp.) is the energy of the 3x3 (3x7 resp.) cell cluster, as shown in Fig. 5 (bottom);
* to achieve good separation between the electrons and the hadrons a minimum signal was required from the integrated preshower, as shown in Fig. 6

In this first analysis, the cuts were optimised for the whole sample, independently of \(p_{T}\). The results are shown for the succesive cuts in Table 2 and can be summarized as follows: for a b-tagging efficiency of about 10%, a rejection factor against hadrons of 157\(\pm\)13 can be achieved, corresponding to the rejection factor against gluon jets of 33\(\pm\)2.

In a second more careful analysis, limited however by the small statistics, both the signal and the background samples were divided into three sub-samples according to the transverse momentum of the particles:

* \(1~{}GeV\leq p_{T}~{}<~{}2~{}GeV\), corresponding to 17.5% of the electrons and 36.8% of the hadrons

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline Cut type & \(\epsilon_{b}\) [\%] & \(R_{b}\) & \(R_{g}\) \\ \hline \hline TRT high/all & 12.8 & 10 & 3 \\ \hline longitudinal shower shape & 11 & 26 & 7 \\ \hline \(E_{cerz}/p_{T}\) & 10.8 & 56 & 12 \\ \hline lateral shower shape & 10.2 & 111 & 23 \\ \hline \(E_{min}\) & 9.9\(\pm\)0.1 & 157\(\pm\)13 & 33\(\pm\)2 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: The cumulative b-tagging efficiency (\(\epsilon_{b}\)), hadron (\(R_{b}\)), and gluon jets (\(R_{g}\)) rejection factors after various cuts without optimization according to \(p_{T}\).

* \(2~{}GeV\leq p_{T}~{}<~{}5~{}GeV\), corresponding to \(36.8\%\) of the electrons and \(41.7\%\) of the hadrons
* \(p_{T}\geq 5~{}GeV\), coresponding to \(45.7\%\) of the electrons, and \(21.5\%\) of the hadrons

The reasons for refining the cut definitions were the obvious \(p_{T}\)-dependence of the electron track reconstruction efficiency (bremsstrahlung effects), the TR-performance and the calorimeter cut efficiencies. In particular, it is clear that, for sample with \(p_{T}\geq 5~{}GeV\) the core shower energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter is more reliably defined and measured than for low \(p_{T}\), and that the transition radiation cut becomes fully efficient only for \(E~{}>~{}2~{}GeV\). To obtain the best possible separation between the electrons from b-jets and the charged particles from gluon jets, the cuts were optimised for each \(p_{T}\)-bin. Tables 3 a), b) and c) present the electron identification efficiency and hadron efficiency for each of these \(p_{T}\)-bins. The efficiency for a particular cut is calculated after applying all previous cuts. The number of particles which survived each cut is also listed. Due to limited statistics, the exact cut values should not be considered as final.

The overall b-tagging efficiency, hadron rejection and gluon rejection factors after various cuts are presented in Table 4. The graphical presentation is shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8.

The same analysis was done for the sample in which both electrons and hadrons had \(p_{T}\geq 2\ GeV\). The same cuts were applied and for b-tagging efficiency of \(\sim\ 8.6\%\) one can achieve the rejection factor against hadrons \(\sim 800\), and the rejection factor against gluon jets \(\sim 85\). After that the cuts were changed in such a way, that for b-tagging efficiency of about 10% the rejection factor against hadrons is 120\(\pm\)12, and the rejection factor against gluons is 38\(\pm\)3.

The background from real electrons coming from gluon jets was calculated. Table 5. presents the number of electrons from the gluon sample which survive each cut.

These electrons come mainly from \(\pi^{0}\rightarrow\gamma\,e^{+}e^{-}\) Dalitz decays. One of two surviving all cuts comes from such a decay, while a second one from a charmed meson decay.

## Conclusions

The analysis described above leads to the conclusion that one can significantly improves overall b-tagging efficiency using soft lepton tagging technique. One can achieve better rejection against hadrons (gluons jets) if the sample includes leptons with \(p_{T}\) down to 1 GeV, and if the cuts are optimized in respect to tetraresrese momentum of the particles.
