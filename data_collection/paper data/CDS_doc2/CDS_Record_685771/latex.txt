The histograms in figure 5 contrast the number of times a certain number of buffers are accessed for a RoI in the layout obtained with the simulated annealing algorithm compared with the previous best algorithm used. This clearly shows an improvement. Both layouts show that the most common occurrence is for 4 buffers to be hit by regions of interest but the simulated annealing algorithm shows a narrower distribution and 71.4% of regions of interest only affect 4 or 5 buffers. The highest number of buffers accessed for a RoI is 8 which occurs only once in the 1344 RoIs.

## 7 Conclusions

The results obtained from the simulated annealing algorithm show a substantial improvement over the previous methods experimented with. The simulated annealing algorithm is not difficult to implement, although several of the parameters require some experimentation in order to obtain the best possible results. Nevertheless there is a disadvantage to the algorithm. Although the majority of buffers contain wafers from the same space, there are some buffers which contain a random wafer from another space in the detector. This will occur when an uphill step is accepted. However, these occasional uphill steps are required to allow the system to get out of a local minimum energy state in favour of a more global minimum. Without the simulated annealing algorithm, the system goes downhill as fast as possible to a local minimum. When the uphill steps were not accepted in the program, the system cooled rapidly to an average of 8.44 buffers contained in a RoI. Increasing the range of temperatures and the number of reconfigurations at each temperature does not appear to make much improvement to this feature of the algorithm.

## 8 Future Work

1. Look at improving the algorithm or possibly 'hand correct' the wafers which are buffered with wafers from different spaces in the detector.
2. Repeat the study for the endcap detector.
3. Rerun the algorithm with the more recent parameters for the SCT detector as used for the demonstrator program of ATLAS. As this layout is symmetrical (there are 12 wafers in Z) it will be possible to experiment using only half the detector in the algorithm.
