###### Abstract

The high luminosity required for the proposed new hadron collider, LHC, at CERN will create severe background problems to the muon detection systems. In this note, the effect of a realistic background field on different muon chamber types is investigated by means of MonteCarlo simulations.

## 1 Introduction

The proposed new hadron collider at CERN (LHC) will require very high luminosities to be able to detect the physics signals of interest. The maximum design luminosity, \(L_{max}=2\times 10^{34}cm^{-2}\), will give rise to an enormous amount of p-p collisions whose effects on the detectors has to be carefully studied. The intensity of such background for the muon detection system of the ATLAS experiment has been computed[1] and found to be substantial.

In this work, the sensitivity to neutrons and photons of different types of muon chambers in the ATLAS hall radiation field has been calculated withFLUKA[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. The electron background has not been included in the calculations because it is mostly produced by local photon interactions, thus it is already accounted for in the photon sensitivities. This assumption is valid at least for the barrel regions and part of the forward regions where few energetic electrons or photons are present.

## 2 Simulation methods

Due to the spacing among superlayers it has been possible to restrict the simulatons to a single superlayer for each chamber option. The spectral distribution of incident neutrons/photons (see figs.1 and 2 ) has been assumed to be the one resulting from the background calculations in the position of the third barrel superlayer at central rapidity, with a 300 keV lower threshold for photons. To simulate an uniform and isotropic irradiation the chambers have been placed at the centre of a sphere, whose inner surface was covered with uniformely distributed diffusion-like sources.A uniform magnetic field of 0.5 T has been applied in the chamber volume to approximately reproduce the operating conditions. Secondary electrons has been produced and followed down to 1 keV in gas and 10 keV in walls. The photon transport cut off was set to 1 keV.

In the neutron sensitivity calculations all the gamma rays produced by neutron interactions in the gas or in the chamber walls have been discarded, as they are already included in the calculated gamma fluxes. This means that the figures given in tables 1 have a real meaning only for the specific situation of the ATLAS hall: any direct comparison of these calulated sensitivities to experimental data would make no sense.

There are, however, many reasons that should discourage a comparisons of the simulations described here with experimentally determined efficiencies, even with incident photons: they refer to a specific, very broad, spectral distribution, and to a isotropically distributed flux, whereas standard experimental conditions refer to normal incidence; they have been calculated for a set of active elements, while normally only one is irradiated in efficiency measurements. An experimental validation of our simulation deserves a separate treatment as will be described in a forthcoming paper [1]

In our simulations a superlayer is defined as follows (for a description of the various techniques see ref [10])

- isobutane gas mixture at 2 Atm. We have assumed that the 2 groups of 3 layers are sufficiently apart so that they can be considered as uncorrelated.

The sensitivity of Monitored Drift Tubes ( MDT ) will be calculated in the next future.

## 3 Results

Any energy deposition exceeding a defined threshold in any active element has been scored as an "hit".

The sensitivity (see tables 1 and 2 ) is expressed as hits/cm\({}^{2}\) per unit of flux in a superlayer, that is including all the layers entering in a superlayer for each specific technique. It follows that it is not a measure of the number of events, since events with energy depositions in more than one active element contribute with more than one hit. Please note the factor 2 in all tables concerning the HPDT, resulting from the above assumption about the in dependency of the 2 triple layers.

As events involving more than one active element in a superlayer can simulate a muon track, the multiplicity distribution of events has been calculated and is reported in tab 2 for photon induced events (almost all events induced by neutrons contain a single hit ) Moreover, multiple events presenting hits approximately aligned along a vertical axis have been recognized and their

\end{table}
Table 1: Sensitivity to neutrons of a superlayer with B=0.5 Tdistribution is reported in table 4.

In order to define an occupancy, that is the probability for a given active element to be "dead" due to a background event, some average values have been adopted: we assumed a tube length of \(6m\), a charge collection time of \(500nsec\), and fluxes equal to \(1\cdot 10^{4}\,\frac{n}{cm^{2}\,s},\,5\cdot 10^{3}\,\frac{\gamma}{cm^{2}\,s}\), near to those expected at central rapidity. We remind that the occupancy is defined as \(F=r\cdot S_{c}\cdot\Delta t\), where \(S_{c}\) is the active element section and \(r\) is the hit rate/cm\({}^{2}\) in a single active element. The obtained values are listed in table 2 and scale almost linearly with all the aforementioned quantities, provided that the shape of the background spectrum is similar to the one used in the calculations. This is not the case in the forward region, where background spectra are harder, thus chamber efficiencies are higher; this effect enhances the occupancy, already high because of the large forward flux.

A few general remarks can be made looking at tables 1-5. Neutron sensitivities and occupancies are dominated by interactions in the gas, thus they depend almost only on gas characteristics: composition, volume and

are discarded; low-energy hits, as seen from tab. 1 count for about one half of the total. Here a remark is mandatory: we cannot give an "a priori" threshold over which an hit can be actually detected, because the energy deposition is due to the stopping of recoil in the gas, and recoils with different masses have different ionization thresholds. The quoted sensitivities can change by large factors varying the hydrogen content of the gas, since hydrogen has a large cross section for low energy neutron interactions. Furthermore recoil protons produced in neutron interactions on hydrogen are the most effective in ionizing the chamber gas.

Gamma sensitivities are dominated by delta rays produced by gamma interactions in the chamber walls, except for very low energy photons. Increasing wall thickness or density increases the sensitivity up to the point where reabsorption of electrons in the walls becomes important. The frequency of multiple and/or aligned events is higher in systems characterized by high granularity and thin (or no-) wall geometries, where electrons can freely travel from one active zone to another.
