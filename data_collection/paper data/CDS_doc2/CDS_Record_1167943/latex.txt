Muon pairs from \(J/\psi\) decay are a clear signature of \(b\) hadrons. As a large fraction of \(b\) hadrons are produced at low-\(p_{T}\), a low rate, efficient di-muon trigger for low-\(p_{T}\) muons and a good understanding of the trigger efficiency are essential. Di-muon final states will also play a key role in calibration, alignment and determination of the trigger efficiencies. The performance of the level-2 dimuon trigger algorithms is discussed, together with a method for reducing backgrounds from decays-in-flight. A strategy for calculating the single muon and di-muon trigger efficiencies at level-1 and level-2 using \(J/\psi\) from the data themselves is presented.

Introduction

\(B\)-physics is one of the areas of the physics programme of the ATLAS experiment. It includes the study of production cross sections, searches for rare \(b\) decays and measurements of CP violation effects. These studies make use of the large \(b\bar{b}\) production cross section at the LHC where \(b\bar{b}\) pairs are abundant in the low transverse momentum (\(p_{T}\)) region. On the other hand, one must extract signals from amongst the large QCD background, mostly composed of light quarks. For this purpose, one of the main channels for \(B\) physics study involves decay channels with one or more muons in the final state, especially the channel \(J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\).

The output rate of the first level trigger at a luminosity of \(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) is expected to contain 20 kHz of events where one muon passed the \(p_{T}\) threshold of 6 GeV. Early running is envisioned to include even lower \(p_{T}\) thresholds, down to the lowest threshold achievable in the hardware.

At the second level trigger this rate of events must be reduced to 1-2 kHz, of which 5-10% are available for channels of interest only to \(B\)-physics. Currently this goal is achieved for level-1 muon triggers by first confirming that a muon over the nominal threshold is reconstructed in the muon spectrometer (MS), and then confirming that there is a matching track in the inner detector (ID). This selection criterion removes many muons from \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays, but does not by itself produce the required rate reduction. To achieve the required rate \(p_{T}\) thresholds need to be raised and many interesting \(b\) events are likely to be filtered out. We therefore focus also on di-muon final states.

We developed an algorithm, TrigDiMuon, which achieves high efficiency at level-2 for the golden CP channels (\(J/\psi\)), using the identification of relatively low-\(p_{T}\) muons from \(J/\psi\) decay. TrigDiMuon searches for di-muon pairs from \(J/\psi\) or other resonant sources, when only one of the muons passed the level-1 or level-2 single muon selection. The use of TrigDiMuon can enhance \(J/\psi\) efficiency at low-\(p_{T}\) compared to the trigger based on two muons found at level-1, with an acceptable increase in the fake rate.

In this note, we present the performance of the TrigDiMuon algorithm, that looks for a second low-\(p_{T}\) muon partner to a single muon triggered at level-1. We compare it to the performance of an algorithm that requires a di-muon level-1 trigger. The comparison is based on a sample of \(J/\psi\) which decayed into muons with low-\(p_{T}\), such that the second muon of each decay may be below the level-1 threshold.

In addition to the foreseen specialised trigger strategies for di-muon signatures, it is important to optimize the rejection of muons from \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays for the standard single muon selection in order to have the lowest possible threshold on the inclusive single muon trigger. This is achieved by extrapolating the muon track from the MS back to the interaction vertex and requiring a good match between this track and the associated track from the ID. Muons from light hadron decays do not match accurately the ID track, which in this case is the track produced by the parent hadron (or from a mixture of hits from the parent and the daughter muon) and not by the muon track. This note presents a method implemented at the level-2 trigger for rejecting muons from \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays. We summarize the rejection power of this method, show that the efficiency loss is minimal for direct muons and estimate the efficiency loss for low-\(p_{T}\) muons from \(J/\psi\) decay.

Cross section measurements or searches for rare decays require a good understanding of the efficiency of the event selection. As we are interested in events with rather low-\(p_{T}\), the understanding of the trigger efficiency is crucial and we must have a strategy for measuring it from data with high precision. The tag-and-probe method for measuring the single muon trigger efficiency using \(J/\psi\) events is presented, and we demonstrate that the obtained trigger efficiency can be applied to calculate the di-muon trigger efficiency. A calibration trigger is proposed to collect an unbiased sample of single muons with an enhanced \(J/\psi\) fraction, and the expected performance of the trigger efficiency measurement in the early days of the data-taking is discussed.

Particles from additional collisions in the same bunch-crossing (pile-up) are not simulated in the samples used for this paper, and therefore this additional background is not taken into account in the analysis.

## 2 Simulated datasets used and production tools

Since the subject of this note is low-\(p_{T}\) muons, we use simulated samples that were produced with especially low-\(p_{T}\) cuts at the event generation level. Samples were generated using the PYTHIA event generator [1]. Except for the minimum bias events, a generator level filter was applied to pre-select efficiently the events in the sample. The di-muons sample passed a filter which required the existence of at least two muons with the appropriate \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) cuts. For the inclusive muon samples the filter required the existence of a single muon passing the corresponding selection. Events were processed with the full simulation of the ATLAS detector based on the GEANT package [2]. The level-1 simulation, High Level Trigger (HLT) selection and offline event reconstruction were performed.

The following di-muon samples were used:

* An 8000 event sample of the channel \(\Lambda_{b}\to J/\psi\Lambda\) with \(J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\), where one of the muons is required at the event generation level to have \(p_{T}>4\) GeV and the second muon is required to have \(p_{T}>2.5\) GeV.
* Simulated samples of direct \(J/\psi\) production and \(b\bar{b}\to J/\psi\) production, with the generator level filter requiring the existence of at least two muons with \(p_{T}>6\) GeV for the highest \(p_{T}\) muon and \(p_{T}>4\) GeV for the second highest \(p_{T}\) muon. For both processes, 150000 events were generated.
* Two samples of inclusive muon from \(b\) decays were used. A 200000 event sample of \(b\bar{b}\rightarrow\mu X\) with a generator level filter requiring one muon with \(p_{T}>4\) GeV, and a sample of 250000 \(b\bar{b}\) events with at least one muon with \(p_{T}>6\) GeV in the final state.
* Since this note deals specifically with methods of rejecting muons from \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays, a large sample of such decays was required. A minimum bias sample where pions and kaons were forced to decay inside the inner tracker volume was produced for this purpose. The method developed for producing this "forced-decay" sample is described in detail below.
* Events containing a single muon each were used to study the effect on prompt muons of the method for rejecting muons from \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays. Some of the single muon samples were simulated with a perfectly aligned detector geometry, while some other samples were simulated with a misaligned detector description.

The trigger and reconstruction software used for some of the samples are of a later version than that used in other notes, because the level-2 and reconstruction software used here have improved significantly in recent version. The software modification will be explained where each package is described. Table 1 summarizes the simulated Monte Carlo samples used in this note.

### Production tools and samples employed for \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays

Minimum bias events are the most copious source of pions and kaons. These particles are produced mainly with very low-\(p_{T}\), and typically the muons coming from their in flight decays do not escape the ATLAS hadronic calorimeter. On the other hand pions and kaons with high-\(p_{T}\) have a low probability to decay before the calorimeter because of their high energy. As a consequence it is not efficient to use minimum bias events as a source of decays in flight to muons. Estimates made for this analysis indicated that the simulation of 5000 minimum bias events would be needed to provide one muon from \(K\) or \(\pi\) decay capable of passing the 6 GeV threshold of the ATLAS level-1 muon trigger.

To increase the statistics of events with charged pions and kaons decaying in flight, a special simulation tool is applied. Since we are interested in decays which happen inside the detector, the decays cannot be made on generator level but must happen in the GEANT simulation. The program to force the \(K\)\(/\pi\) to decay in the detector is an extension to GEANT which runs before the simulation itself.

In each event a list of all charged pions and kaons with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV is compiled, and one of the particles in the list is randomly selected. Events with no charged pions or kaons with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV are dropped at this stage, such that the events are not further simulated and nothing is written to output.

The point of decay is selected by first computing the trajectory length from the production vertex to where the particle would exit the ID (neglecting curvature in the magnetic field). The decay position is then determined by taking a random fraction of this maximum track length. Since particles assigned a late decay have a larger probability to be stopped through hadronic interactions, this procedure may introduce a weak bias towards shorter decay lengths.

For this study a minimum bias sample of 114 k events was simulated with forced decays. The transverse momentum cut of 2 GeV applied to the light hadrons reduces the cross section of the sample to \((43.41\pm 0.07)\)% of the minimum bias cross section. In addition to this a minimum bias sample of 500 k events, simulated with the standard GEANT simulator, was also employed to provide a cross-check from a single source for both the muons from \(K\)\(/\pi\) decay and the prompt muons.

## 3 The muon trigger

The ATLAS trigger system [3] reduces the event rate from the 40 MHz beam crossing rate to \(\sim\)200 Hz for mass storage, keeping the events that are potentially the most interesting for physics. The first level trigger [4] selection is performed by custom hardware and identifies a detector region for which a trigger element was found. The second level trigger [5] is performed by dedicated software, making its decision based on data acquired from the Region of Interest (RoI) identified at level-1. Eventually, the event filter [5] uses the complete event data, and algorithms adapted from the offline reconstruction, to refine the selection of level-2 and further reduce the trigger rate by about a factor 10. An event must pass all trigger levels to be kept for analysis.

A detailed description of the ATLAS muon trigger and the estimated trigger rates are presented in [6]. Here we give a very brief summary of the principles of the level-1 and level-2 muon triggers.

### The level-1 muon trigger

The level-1 muon trigger is based on dedicated fast detectors: the Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) in the barrel and the Thin Gap Chambers (TGC) in the end-caps [7]. The basic principle of the algorithm is to require a coincidence of hits in the different trigger stations within a predefined angular region, called a

"road", from the interaction point through the detector. The width of the road is related to the bending of the muon in the magnetic field and thus to the \(p_{T}\) threshold to be applied.

The trigger in both the barrel and the end-cap regions is based on three trigger stations at different distances from the interaction point [4]. The low-\(p_{T}\) triggers (4 to 10 GeV) are derived from a coincidence in two stations, while the high-\(p_{T}\) triggers (over 10 GeV) require an additional coincidence with the third station. In the end-cap, there is an option to use all three stations also for the low-\(p_{T}\) trigger. This option is the one used in the trigger performance studies in Reference [6].

The level-1 trigger provides for each muon candidate the region where it was found, called the region of interest (RoI). For the muon trigger, the size of the level-1 RoI is \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\) in the barrel and \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.03\times 0.03\) in the end-cap region, respectively.

### The level-2 single-muon trigger

The level-2 trigger is a software-based trigger and uses the information of the Region of Interest provided by the level-1 trigger. Level-2 algorithms only process data around the RoI, using the full granularity of the detector readout within the RoI.

The HLT trigger selection proceeds in "trigger chains". A chain consists of a series of reconstruction and decision (hypothesis) algorithms that process the data in a RoI identified by level-1. The role of the level-2 muon trigger is to confirm muon candidates flagged by the level-1 and to give more precise track parameters for the muon candidate.

The level-2 muon selection is performed in two stages. The first stage is performed by the muFast algorithm [8], which starts from a level-1 muon RoI and reconstructs the muon in the spectrometer, using the more precise Monitored Drift Tubes (MDT) to perform a new \(p_{T}\) estimate for the muon candidate and creating a new trigger element. The hypothesis algorithm cuts on the estimated \(p_{T}\) and passes the validated trigger elements to the next algorithm.

Track finding in the inner detector is based on the region of the candidate found by muFast. The muFast candidate and ID tracks are passed to the next algorithm, muComb, which matches an ID track with the trigger element from the muon spectrometer and refines the \(p_{T}\) estimate [5].

#### 3.2.1 muFast

For level-1 RoI's flagged by the RPC (barrel region) and the TGC (end-cap region), muFast performs global pattern recognition, a local segment fit in each muon station and a fast \(p_{T}\) estimation. The global pattern recognition is designed to select clusters in MDT tubes belonging to a muon track without using the drift time measurements. It is divided into two steps, firstly the pattern recognition in the trigger chambers seeded by the level-1 RoI, and the subsequent MDT pattern recognition seeded by the result of the previous step. In the MDT pattern recognition muon roads are opened in selected MDT chambers, and the loactions of hit tubes are collected. A contiguity algorithm is applied on the selected hits to remove the background.

The track reconstruction approximates a muon track as a series of segments built separately in each MDT chamber. Segments are reconstructed using the drift time measurements and an approximate calibration to obtain hit radii from them. The fitted segments provide a precision measurement of the point where the fitted line crosses the middle of the MDT chamber, called the super-point.

The track bending is measured in a different way in the barrel and the end-cap. In the barrel, the sagitta is computed from the three super-points found in the three stations. In the end-cap, the track bending is measured by the angle \(\alpha\) between the track direction measured by the muon chambers in the middle and outer stations of the muon spectrometer, and the direction obtained by connecting the nominal interaction vertex with the mean hit position in the middle station.

The muon transverse momentum is estimated using an inverse linear relationship between the measured sagitta (in the barrel) or \(\alpha\) (in the end-cap) and \(p_{T}\). The detector region is divided into bins in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) and the parameters of this inverse linear function are estimated in each bin.

#### 3.2.2 muComb

The muComb algorithm matches the muon track found by muFast to ID tracks reconstructed at level-2 citeID-CSC. In reconstructing the level-2 ID tracks, only hits from the pixel and SCT detectors were used, for speed.

The matching between muFast and ID track segments proceeds as follows. First, a preselection of ID tracks is made based on the difference in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) between muFast and ID track segments. In the barrel, this preselection also makes use of the difference in the \(Z\) of the extrapolated track segments at the radius of the barrel calorimeter. A weighted combined \(p_{T}\), and a matching \(\chi^{2}\), are calculated for each ID track passing the preselection in combination with the muon track information, and the ID track giving the lowest \(\chi^{2}\) is selected as the best match to the muFast track.

The version of the algorithm used in this study is improved with respect to that used in [6]. The resolution of muFast tracks assumed in combining with the ID tracks have been retuned, using the correct \(p_{T}\) resolutions for the different end-cap regions, and for the misaligned detector geometry. A specific tuning of the matching windows is used to improve the resolution for very low \(p_{T}\) muons. This algorithm will be referred to as "the baseline muComb selection" in Section 5, where a modified algorithm with better rejection for muons from \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays is also described, and the performance of the two algorithms is compared.

#### 3.2.3 Level-2 muon hypotheses

The \(p_{T}\) cuts corresponding to each nominal threshold are set so that 90% of the muons at the nominal threshold would pass the selection. The actual cuts used depend on the resolution of the \(p_{T}\) estimation. Therefore the cuts are different for different regions of the detector as well as different between muFast and muComb. Thus for a nominal threshold of 6  the muFast hypothesis cuts at estimated \(p_{T}\) values between 4.5 and 5.4  in the different \(\eta\) regions, while the muComb hypothesis cuts at estimated \(p_{T}\) of 5.8 in the barrel and end-cap and 5.6 in the forward region. Since the \(p_{T}\) resolution of muComb is better than that of muFast, the cuts are closer to the nominal thresholds, and reject more muons with \(p_{T}\) below the threshold. A special case is the 4 nominal threshold which is meant to accept lower \(p_{T}\) muons and the cuts are set at 3 in the barrel and 2.5 in the end-cap for both muFast and muComb.

### The level-2 di-muon triggers

There are two approaches at level-2 for selecting di-muon events from a resonance such as \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\). The first approach is to start from a di-muon trigger at level-1 which produces two muon regions of interest. In this approach, reconstruction of a muon is confirmed separately in each RoI as described above and the two muons are subsequently combined to form a resonance and to apply a mass cut. We will refer to this trigger as the "topological di-muon trigger".

An alternative approach is to start with a level-1 single muon trigger and search for two muons in a wider \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) region. This approach starts from reconstructing tracks in the inner detector and extrapolating the track to the muon spectrometer to tag muon tracks. Since this method does not explicitly require the second muon at level-1, it has an advantage for reconstructing \(J/\psi\) at low-\(p_{T}\). This is implemented in the TrigDiMuon algorithm. The two approaches using either two or one muon RoI are illustrated in Figure 1.

#### 3.3.1 The TrigDiMuon algorithm

TrigDiMuon is a level-2 trigger algorithm based on associations established between ID tracks and MS hits. Each time a pair of oppositely charged ID tracks, above a minimal invariant mass, is successfully associated with the MS hits, a muon pair object is created with the parameters of these ID tracks. Later, in the hypothesis step, an additional invariant mass selection can be applied, thus selecting interesting physics objects such as \(J/\psi\) or \(B\).

The motivation for developing this algorithm comes from the fact that while di-muon final states exist in many interesting \(B\)-physics channels, the cross sections for di-muon final states are orders of magnitude smaller than those for single muons of the same \(p_{T}\). An additional advantage is that resonant final states can also be used to calibrate trigger efficiencies as will be shown in Section 5.

First, the initial muon RoI is extended in order to search for a second muon, which was not triggered by level-1. The input muon may be from a region of interest identified at level-1, but the input rate to the algorithm can be reduced if, prior to the RoI extension, the level-1 RoI would be confirmed in the level-2 trigger by the muFast and (possibly also) the muComb algorithms. The performance of these options is studied in Section 4. The size of the extended RoI is based on the distribution of angular distance in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) between two muons from \(J/\psi\) decay. Figure 2 shows the probability of including the second muon from \(J/\psi\) decays RoI as a function of the extended RoI size for different samples. The current default region size in TrigDiMuon is \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.75\times 0.75\).

The ID tracks in the search region are found using the trigger-tracking program IdScan or SiTrack [9], and are selected if they form a pair of oppositely charged tracks with invariant mass \(M>2.8\). Each selected track is extrapolated to the different stations of the MS using a formula parameterizing the expected track bending in the magnetic field. The bending parameterization is calculated separately for different regions of the muon spectrometer to account correctly for the inhomogeneous toroidal field in the end-cap region. Figure 3 shows the difference, \(\Delta\eta\), between \(\eta\) measured in the inner detector and that measured in the middle station of the muon spectrometer. The lines indicate the choice of \(\eta\) regions for the parameterization. The parameterization was also subdivided in \(\phi\).

The algorithm then searches for muon hits within a road around the extrapolated track. The road size also differs for different \(\eta\) regions. If a sufficient number of muon hits are found in the MS, the track is

identified as a muon. If both tracks from the pair are identified as muons, a muon pair object is created. The two tracks are fit to a common vertex, and the vertex \(\chi^{2}\) is calculated to allow a later selection of only the pairs with a good quality vertex.

## 4 Performance of the level-2 di-muon triggers for \(J/\psi\)

In this Section the efficiency and fake rates resulting from the two approaches to selecting di-muons at level-2 will be presented and compared. For the TrigDiMuon algorithm we calculate the efficiency and fake rates in three different trigger chains.

In the first configuration, TrigDiMuon runs directly after the level-1 trigger based on the RoI produced by level-1. The performance of this trigger is compared to the efficiency and fake rate of the level-1 di-muon trigger.

The other two trigger chains confirm a single level-2 muon before calling TrigDiMuon. The purpose of these chains is not to reduce the fake di-muon trigger rate, but rather to reduce processing time by reducing the input rate to TrigDiMuon. Since TrigDiMuon starts from ID track reconstruction in an extended region around the muon region of interest, the tracking in the inner detector requires three times longer than if only reconstructing ID tracks in the narrow road used by muComb. Thus, this time consuming process can be avoided for candidates for which the level-1 trigger is not confirmed at level-2.

In the second chain TrigDiMuon runs after muFast. The input to TrigDiMuon in this case is a muon confirmed in the MS, with a cut on the \(p_{T}\) estimated at this stage. The efficiency of this trigger is compared with that of a topological di-muon trigger based on a level-1 di-muon with two oppositely charged muons confirmed in the MS at level-2.

In the third chain TrigDiMuon runs after muComb. The input to TrigDiMuon in this case is a muon confirmed in the MS and the ID, with a cut on the \(p_{T}\) estimated at this stage. The efficiency of this trigger is compared with that of the topological di-muon trigger with two oppositely charged level-2 combined muons, within the same invariant mass window. The invariant mass window can be applied in this chain, and not the second chain, because only after muComb the momentum resolution is sufficient for a reasonable selection on invariant mass.

The efficiency and fake rates of these trigger sequences were studied for two different trigger thresholds, a 4 GeV threshold that is envisioned to run at initial luminosity, and a 6 GeV threshold that will be the lowest threshold for running at a luminosity of \(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\).

A selection requiring the two muons to be oppositely charged, and the pair to have invariant mass between 2.8 GeV and 3.4 GeV was applied to both TrigDiMuon and the topological di-muon trigger. For the topological algorithm the invariant mass selection was only applied after muComb. The fake rates were calculated as follows: the probability of each of the level-2 strategies to find a di-muon pair in events which contain only a single muon was estimated separately for the \(b\) events and the minimum-bias events. This probability was multiplied by rates which were estimated independently from [6], but are consistent with it. The fake probability in \(b\) events was taken to be representative of that in all events with prompt muons. For the topological di-muon trigger, the probability was calculated relative to the number of di-muon level-1 triggers, and multiplied by the level-1 fake di-muon trigger rate from [6].

### Efficiency relative to events accepted at level-1

Table 2 gives the efficiency, relative to level-1, for the two di-muon trigger algorithms for a trigger threshold of 4 GeV. Table 3 gives the efficiencies, relative to level-1, for a trigger threshold of 6 GeV. The efficiencies in these tables are calculated with respect to the \(J/\psi\) events accepted by the corresponding level-1 single muon trigger. In parenthesis we give the efficiency relative to \(J/\psi\) events at the starting point of the di-muon algorithm.

One can see that the TrigDiMuon efficiency is significantly higher than the topological di-muon trigger in all cases. As a matter of fact, the topological di-muon trigger, which applies \(p_{T}\) cuts on both muons, can have only a limited acceptance for \(J/\psi\) events passing a single muon trigger because the second muon is very frequently below the trigger threshold. To pass the topological di-muon trigger the second, lower \(p_{T}\) muon also has to pass the level-2 selections.

Because TrigDiMuon can reconstruct muons below the level-1 thresholds, the TrigDiMuon efficiency, shown in brackets, remains nearly the same with the different chains. However, the total efficiency is reduced when starting from the single muons accepted by muFast or muComb, because of the \(p_{T}\) cut imposed by those algorithms. In particular, in Table 3 muFast and muComb reject successively more of the muons below the nominal threshold and this explains the big drop from row to row for TrigDimuon and even bigger drop for the topological trigger.

The loss of efficiency in the single muon triggers is smaller for the 4 GeV threshold, because the level-2 cuts for the 4 GeV threshold are quite loose, as mentioned above. When calculating the 4 GeV trigger efficiency using only muons from \(J/\psi\) with generated \(p_{T}\) above the 4 GeV threshold, TrigDiMuon has an efficiency of 90% and the topological trigger has an efficiency of 64%.

As discussed earlier, in spite of some loss of efficiency, the trigger chains with TrigDiMuon running after a level-2 confirmed muon might be more suitable to an overall planning of the ATLAS trigger menu due to the reduced input rate they have to sustain.

### Fake rates

Table 4 gives the expected fake rates for TrigDiMuon with the different chains described above, for a trigger threshold of 4 GeV at a luminosity of \(10^{31}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). Table 5 gives the rates for a trigger threshold of 6 GeV at a luminosity of \(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\).

To estimate the efficiency we used a sample of \(\Lambda_{b}\to J/\psi\Lambda\), where \(J/\psi\rightarrow\mu(p_{T}>2.5\) GeV\()\mu(p_{T}>4\) GeV\()\).

Fake rates can be further reduced by reconstructing the \(J/\psi\) decay vertex from the two muon tracks. Selecting \(J/\psi\) with a good quality vertex fit will reduce fake rates from unrelated track combinations. Figure 4 shows the distribution of the vertex \(\chi^{2}\) for true \(J/\psi\) decays and for fake di-muon triggers. A cut of \(\chi^{2}<30\) reduces the fake rate by 20-30% and only reduces the trigger efficiency by 1-2%. The vertex position can also be used to reject \(J/\psi\) produced at the primary interaction and accept only \(J/\psi\) from \(b\) hadron decays, but a study of this is outside the scope of this note.

Finally Table 6 compares the total rates and efficiencies of the two level-2 di-muon algorithms. When TrigDiMuon runs after muComb, the signal to background ratio is worse than when it runs after muFast. Using the input rates from Table 4 and 5, one can calculate that the time needed to reconstruct the ID tracks is also the smallest when TrigDiMuon runs after muFast, reduced by 1/3 for the 4 threshold and by 1/2 for the 6 GeV threshold with respect to running after L1.

It can be seen from this table that the fake rate for the topological di-muon trigger is small. The

The \(b\)-physics trigger rate from TrigDiMuon requires further reduction for \(L=10^{33}\). This can be achieved by introducing an additional trigger with a cut on the \(J/\psi\) decay length. Then the trigger without decay length cut will be prescaled to an acceptable rate for calibration and alignment purposes, as for example in Section 6. An event filter algorithm will further reduce the rates for a luminosity of \(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\).

### Efficiency relative to reconstructed events

Our goal is to maximize trigger efficiency at the level-2 trigger for the muons that can later be identified offline. The efficiencies for the two algorithms and thresholds were re-estimated with respect to the \(J/\psi\) events reconstructed with the muon identification program MuGirl [10], which is efficient for low-\(p_{T}\) muons. The resulting efficiencies are given in Table 7 for a trigger thresholds of 4 GeV and 6 GeV respectively. Figure 5 shows the efficiency of TrigDiMuon relative to muons identified by MuGirl for the higher \(p_{T}\) muon (left) and the second muon (right).

## 5 Rejection of muons from \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays

The lowest single muon \(p_{T}\) threshold in the original ATLAS HLT design [5] was chosen to be 6 GeV. This is because below this \(p_{T}\) value the rate of muons from \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays becomes higher than that from \(b\) and \(c\) decays. Nevertheless, during the low luminosity phase, it is desirable to collect muons with lower \(p_{T}\), both for detector and trigger calibration and for initial physics studies. If thresholds are lowered, \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays become the dominant source of single muon triggers. These decay muons must be rejected as early as possible so as not to dominate the single muon trigger rate, thus ensuring we can achieve the physics and calibration studies with prompt muons.

### Description of the method

The method we describe rejects \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays based not on their \(p_{T}\) but on the topology of the decay. The track position of a prompt muon, extrapolated from the MS to the interaction vertex, is a gaussian distributed around the ID track position. The corresponding distribution of a decay muon around the light hadron from which it decayed is broader because of the contribution of the decay kink in addition to the multiple scattering effect. Thus if the track seen in the inner detector is that of the \(K\) or \(\pi\), this discrepancy with prompt muons can be used to reject some of the muons from light hadron decays.

With this method, we can reject the muons from \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays by using a matching window tuned for prompt muons, with the window width varying according to the track \(p_{T}\). Due to time constraints, a precise propagation of tracks in the magnetic field can not be done at level-2, so instead the muon track from the MS is extrapolated back to the interaction vertex using a parameterization that is a function of measured \(\eta\), \(\phi\) and \(p_{T}\) (exploiting the linear relationship between the bending and \(1/p_{T}\)). Multiple scattering effects can be parameterized in the same way to estimate the corresponding errors of the back extrapolation, which determine the window size.

Three main regions are identified for the field parameterization used to propagate the muon tracks, one in the barrel and two in the end-cap. To account for the relative inhomogeneity of the magnetic field inside each region, the parameters of the back extrapolation are computed as a function of \(\eta\), \(\phi\), muon charge and spectrometer side (\(z\) or \(-z\)). A different tuning is used for high and low-\(p_{T}\) tracks, to take into account the fluctuations of the energy loss in the calorimeter which are important for the propagation of the latter. In the end-cap, the innermost station of the MS does not provide a complete geometric coverage, thus for the muons with no hits in the innermost station, a seed from the middle station is used to extrapolate the track back. This is the most difficult case since an extrapolation through the toroids must be performed and the resulting precision is spoiled by a factor of two with respect to the other cases. Therefore the back extrapolation in the end-cap is treated separately for regions with inner station coverage and region without inner station coverage.

The strategy for the level-2 combined muon reconstruction described in [5] is to use only the pixel and the SCT data. With this setup, the decays in flight happening near or after the last SCT layer are reconstructed using mainly the hits of the decaying \(K\) or \(\pi\). Some rejection of these events can be achieved by checking the \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) position of the extrapolated MS track relative to the ID track with a matching window whose size is based on the position spread coming out from the muon multiple scattering. Some of the decays between the pixel and the SCT can be rejected by applying a cut on the \(\chi^{2}\) of the Inner Detector fit.

The cuts studied, ordered in terms of increasing rejection are:

* A loose-window cut, using the muon track position from muFast, and the track position from the ID reconstrruction. The window size was tuned to recover almost 100% of the multiple scattering for a muon \(p_{T}\) equal to the threshold value (4 GeV and 6 GeV);
* A tight-window cut, refining the muon back-extrapolation by exploiting the measurement of the interaction vertex from the ID reconstruction. The window size was tuned to 2.7 \(\sigma\) of the multiple scattering spread for that muon \(p_{T}\); the combined \(p_{T}\) estimation is used to tune the window width;
* The normalized \(\chi^{2}\) of the ID track fit is required to be less than 3.2.

### Performance of the method

#### 5.2.1 Rejection results for \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays

The 6 GeV threshold is used as a benchmark to estimate the \(K\) and \(\pi\) rejection achieved by the various cuts. The forced-decay minimum bias sample has been used to study and tune the cuts to reject muonsfrom \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays. The results shown in Table 8 are expressed in terms of trigger rate, computed using the cross section of these events.

Figure 6 shows the trigger efficiency for muons from \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays as a function of \(p_{T}\) for the baseline muComb selection, compared to the tight window selection described above.

#### 5.2.2 Efficiency loss for prompt muons

The efficiency loss for prompt muons due to the matching window cuts has been estimated with a single muon sample. Figure 7 shows the relative efficiency obtained for the aligned detector setup. The relative efficiency is seen to be almost constant in the \(p_{T}\) range of 4-40 GeV and its value for the cut at 2.7 \(\sigma\) is about 98%. The detector misalignment reduces the efficiency plateau to 95% as shown in Figure 8, but the relative efficiency can be recovered by 1% with a specific tuning of the back extrapolator.

The rate reduction for \(b\) decays is calculated reliably from the \(b\to\mu(4)+X\) sample. The results are shown in Table 9. A good agreement between \(b\) events and single muons is found for the efficiency loss due to the tight window match.

#### 5.2.3 Resulting muon trigger rates

A coherent description of the full trigger rate after the muComb algorithm is obtained using the standard minimum bias sample and is shown in Table 10 and in Table 11. All the cuts mentioned were applied. A

very good agreement is found with both the forced sample for the \(K\)\(/\pi\) component, and the \(b\to\mu+X\) sample for the \(b\) component.

The optimized version of muComb improves the rejection of muons from decays in flight by about 30% at the 4 GeV threshold and of about 20% at the 6 GeV threshold with respect to the baseline muComb algorithm. The rejection of muons from b events is 20% at the 4 GeV threshold and 7% at the 6 GeV threshold. Thus while the total trigger rate is reduced the purity of the sample increases. Given the uncertainties on the estimation of the production cross section for \(K\) and \(\pi\) this optimization is crucial for the low-\(p_{T}\) single muon trigger.

Checking the effect of this method to reject muons from \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays on the two level-2 dimuon strategies showed that both efficiency and trigger rates are reduced. There is no significant gain in purity from this method for the di-muon selections, because the rejection is achieved by using the \(J/\psi\) reconstruction and mass cuts, and most of the fake rate comes from \(b\) and \(c\) decays.

Measuring trigger efficiency for low-\(p_{T}\) muons from ATLAS data

### Method description

Cross section measurements require a good understanding of the efficiency of the event selections. A precise understanding of the trigger efficiency is crucial and we must have a strategy for measuring it from data with high precision. We study the performance of measuring the trigger efficiency from data with the tag-and-probe method which uses di-muon final states for measuring the single muon trigger efficiency. In this method, a single triggered muon from a reconstructed di-muon decay of a specific particle identified by mass cuts provides the tag that allows us to probe the trigger efficiency of the second muon.

For \(B\) physics we are interested in events with rather low-\(p_{T}\) muons, so the tag-and-probe method for measuring the single muon trigger efficiency using \(J/\psi\) events is presented. We demonstrate that the obtained trigger efficiency can be applied to calculate the di-muon trigger efficiency. This principle can also be applied to Z decays to calibrate the high-\(p_{T}\) trigger efficiency [11].

#### 6.1.1 Measuring single muon efficiency

We use the tag-and-probe method to measure the muon trigger efficiency, using as the calibration sample events collected by a single muon trigger where the \(J/\psi\) is found in the offline reconstruction. In this sample, one of the muons forming the \(J/\psi\) is triggered, while the other one may or may not be triggered, thus providing an unbiased sample of muons to study the single muon trigger efficiency.

First, the triggered muon is matched to one of the reconstructed muons from an identified \(J/\psi\). This muon is called the _tagged_-muon. Once the tagged-muon is identified, the other muon, the _probe_-muon is used to check whether it is also triggered or not. A matching between the reconstructed muon and the one found at the trigger level is needed here too.

At the high level trigger, the position of the muon found at the trigger level is stored, and can be compared precisely to the reconstructed muon. However, at level-1 the position granularity is that of the RoI. Due to the limited precision of the location of the RoI, care must be taken when matching a muon RoI to the reconstructed muon. The bending of the muon tracks in the magnetic field and the fact that high-\(p_{T}\) decay muons have small opening angles between them also introduces an ambiguity in the matching.

The single muon trigger efficiency, \(\epsilon_{1\mu}\), is calculated as the ratio between the number of probe muons which were triggered (\(N_{probe\&triggered}\)) to the total number of probe muons (\(N_{probe}\)),

\[\epsilon_{1\mu}=\frac{N_{probe\&triggered}}{N_{probe}}. \tag{1}\]

The single muon efficiency can be obtained in detail as a function of kinematic variables (\(p_{T}\), \(\eta\), \(\phi\)) of the muons using as fine a binning as the statistics allows. A fine binning is, in fact, necessary since the efficiency depends on these variables, especially at level-1 where there are sharp changes in the efficiency due to structural features such as the experiment's support structures. Because of this the overall efficiency depends on the distribution of the muons produced. We call the detailed _map_ of efficiencies in each region of the phase space a trigger efficiency map.

Our primary goal is to demonstrate that it is possible to obtain the trigger efficiency map from data alone. The di-muon trigger efficiency can then be calculated from it, given the distribution of the parent particles and the decay angular distribution.

#### 6.1.2 Calculating di-muon trigger efficiency

The di-muon trigger efficiency can be calculated using the obtained single muon efficiencies, taking into account the dependence on kinematic variables of the muons. For example, the efficiency of \(J/\psi\) particles are different depending on the kinematic distribution of the two decay muons. The \(J/\psi\) efficiency, \(\epsilon^{J/\psi}\) can be calculated using the single muon trigger efficiency map as

\[\epsilon_{J/\psi}(p_{T}^{J/\psi},\eta^{J/\psi},\phi^{J/\psi})=\frac{1}{2\pi} \iint\epsilon_{1\mu}(p_{T}^{\mu_{1}},\eta^{\mu_{1}},\phi^{\mu_{1}})\epsilon_{1 \mu}(p_{T}^{\mu_{2}},\eta^{\mu_{2}},\phi^{\mu_{2}})f(\cos\theta^{*})d\cos\theta ^{*}d\phi^{*}. \tag{2}\]

Here, \(f(\cos\theta^{*})\) is the angular distribution of the decay muon from the \(J/\psi\) where \(\theta^{*}\) represents the decay angle of the muon in the \(J/\psi\) rest frame with the \(z\)-axis taken as the direction of the \(J/\psi\) in the laboratory frame. The variable \(\phi^{*}\) is the azimuthal angle of the decay muon in the \(J/\psi\) rest frame, normalized as \(\int f(\cos\theta^{*})d\cos\theta^{*}=1\). Kinematic variables of the decay muons (\(p_{T}^{\mu_{1}}\), \(p_{T}^{\mu_{2}}\),\(\eta^{\mu_{1}}\), \(\eta^{\mu_{2}}\), \(\phi^{\mu_{1}}\), \(\phi^{\mu_{2}}\)) are functions of the \(J/\psi\) variables, \(\cos\theta^{*}\) and \(\phi^{*}\). To get the overall efficiency of \(J/\psi\) events, the integration of \(J/\psi\) variables must be performed in the kinematic region of the cross-section definition.

Note that this formula is universal and can be applied to other resonances such as \(B_{s,d}\rightarrow\mu\mu X\) using the same single muon efficiency map. The \(\cos\theta^{*}\) distribution depends on the polarization state of the \(J/\psi\) which reflects the \(J/\psi\) production mechanism. For the unpolarized case, this distribution is flat. In certain analysis, the production mechanism of the parent particle could be of interest, so we cannot assume the distribution to be flat. In such cases, it is necessary to be able to calculate the efficiency as a function of \(\cos\theta^{*}\) as well. In these cases, Equation 2 would become,

\[\epsilon_{J/\psi}(p_{T}^{J/\psi},\eta^{J/\psi},\phi^{J/\psi},\cos\theta^{*})= \frac{1}{2\pi}\int\epsilon_{1\mu}(p_{T}^{\mu_{1}},\eta^{\mu_{1}},\phi^{\mu_{1 }})\epsilon_{1\mu}(p_{T}^{\mu_{2}},\eta^{\mu_{2}},\phi^{\mu_{2}})d\phi^{*} \tag{3}\]

without the \(\cos\theta^{*}\) integration. Equation 3 is simply expressing the efficiency of events where \(J/\psi\) is produced with a fixed momentum and the decay angle is also fixed, so the decay muon momenta are also fixed. Some variables could be integrated out, but the important thing is that the efficiency with respect to \(\cos\theta^{*}\) can also be obtained from the single muon efficiency map, \(\epsilon_{1\mu}(p_{T}^{\mu},\eta^{\mu},\phi^{\mu})\).

### Performance studies

In order to emulate the efficiency measurement from data, we use \(J/\psi\) events with two muons in the offline reconstruction passing the single muon threshold of 6 GeV and a di-muon invariant mass between 2.88 GeV and 3.3 GeV.

#### 6.2.1 Matching of muons at trigger and reconstruction

The first step of the tag-and-probe method is to find out which of the two offline muons was triggered. This is done by finding the best match using \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\), where \(\Delta\eta\) and \(\Delta\phi\) are the difference of \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) between the offline muon and the triggered muon. For the matching with level-2 muons, track parameters at the perigee are used. On the other hand, for level-1, the position of the triggered muon is taken as the center of the RoI. In this case, the matching must be done carefully as the opening angle of the two muons from the \(J/\psi\) is small and the bending, of the rather low-\(p_{T}\) muons, in the magnetic field is non-negligible. The offline muon tracks are extrapolated to the plane of the RPC or TGC chamber which defines the RoI.

Figure 9 shows the \(\Delta R\) distrbution between the level-1 RoI and offline track with and without using the extrapolation. The improvement obtained by the extrapolation is significant and as a result a good matching is established by requiring \(\Delta R<0.15\). To further reduce the possibility of having a wrong match, in this study we only use events where the opening angle between the two muons is \(\Delta R>0.4\).

Figure 10 shows the \(\Delta R\) distribution between the level-2 muon and the offline track. The resolution of \(\Delta R\) becomes an order of magnitude better than at level-1 since the level-2 muon tracks use the measurements from the ID. The condition \(\Delta R<0.005\) is used for the matching between the offline track and the level-2 track.

#### 6.2.2 Level-1 efficiency

Using the method described in Section 6.1 and the matching criteria, we obtain the single muon efficiency as a function of the \(p_{T}\) of the muon. Figure 11 shows the single muon efficiency as a function of \(p_{T}\) by evaluating how often the probe-muon was triggered. The points are fitted with the function

\[\epsilon(p_{T})=\frac{A}{1+\exp(-a\times(p_{T}-b)))}. \tag{4}\]

Figure 10: The distribution of \(\Delta R\) between the level-2 muon and the offline muon track. The dashed line shows the value where the cut was applied for the matching.

Figure 9: The distribution of \(\Delta R\) between the level-1 RoI and the offline muon track, (a) using the offline track parameters at the perigee and (b) by extrapolating the offline track to the RoI position. The dashed line shows the value where the cut was applied for the matching.

Also shown in Figure 11 is the efficiency measured directly in the single muon Monte Carlo sample which provides an unbiased value of the efficiency. The agreement of the efficiencies obtained by the two methods is around 5% in the turn-on region (4 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}<p_{T}<8\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\)) and becomes smaller as the \(p_{T}\) increases, becoming within a few percent at \(p_{T}>10\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\).

To calculate the di-muon trigger efficiency using Equation 2, the efficiency curve must be measured in each \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) region. For this, we divided the detector into \(10\times 10\) regions for the barrel (\(-1.05<\eta<1.05\)). For the end-cap region (\(1.05<|\eta|<2.4\)), we assumed that there is a complete symmetry between octants and divided one octant into \(8\times 6\) regions. Efficiency curves as a function of \(p_{T}\) are obtained in each of the regions. Figure 12 shows the three fit parameters, \(A\), \(a\) and \(b\) in Equation 4 as a function of \(\eta\) and \(\phi\). The figure shows that the efficiency curve behaves differently for different regions but in a smooth way, except for a small region around \(\eta=0.725\) and \(\phi=-1.6\). In this region the efficiency is very low due to the MS layout and as a result the fit is unreliable. These results are used to calculate the di-muon efficiency.

Distributions of offline \(J/\psi\) variables, \(p_{T}^{J/\psi}\), \(\eta^{J/\psi}\) and \(\cos\theta^{*}\) are shown in Figure 13 after applying the selection criteria of muons (\(p_{T}^{\mu}>6\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) and \(|\eta^{\mu}|<2.4\)). The open histograms are for all \(J/\psi\) in the MC sample and the filled histograms are for events where the level-1 di-muon trigger, requiring at least two muons with \(p_{T}>6\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\), has fired. The generator level filter with the \(p_{T}\) cut for the highest (second highest) \(p_{T}\) muon of \(p_{T}>6(4)\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) was applied for the MC sample.

The \(\cos\theta^{*}\) distribution reflects the polarization state of the \(J/\psi\) and is flat for the non-polarized case. Since the \(\cos\theta^{*}\) distribution is an interesting quantity to measure in its own right, we do not make any assumptions about this distribution but instead try to measure the efficiency as a function of \(\cos\theta^{*}\). Although the generated \(\cos\theta^{*}\) distributions were flat, reconstructed distributions will be biased by the \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) cuts applied at the generator level. At \(|\cos\theta^{*}|=1\), one of the decay muons flies in the opposite direction to the \(J/\psi\) and has low transverse momentum, therefore these events are more likely to be rejected by the \(p_{T}\) cut for the highest (second highest) \(p_{T}\) muon of \(p_{T}>6(4)\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) requirement.

obtained by checking the decision of the level-1 di-muon trigger for each event. The efficiencies calculated using the parameterization in Figure 12 are shown by the filled circles. They are calculated by assigning an efficiency for each event according to the kinematics of the two muons in the final state using Equation 3. The same technique may be used once data are collected by the experiment. The effect of the systematic uncertainty of the method has been estimated by changing the procedure to obtain the trigger efficiency map, namely by using \(16\times 16\) bins in \(\eta-\phi\) in the barrel and \(15\times 10\) in the endcap. In addition, the fitting function has been changed by adding a linear function \(c(p_{T}-d)\) to the original function for \(p_{T}>d\). This was done to better describe a drop of efficiency for higher \(p_{T}\). \(c\) and \(d\) are additional fit parameters. Both statistical and systematic errors are a few % in most of the region, but the systematic uncertainty increases where the change of efficiency is rapid. In Figure 14, the statistical and systematic errors are added in quadrature.

Results of the two methods agree within a few % in most regions. Efficiency losses at \(\eta^{J/\psi}\) around -1, 0 and +1 are due to the layout of the muon trigger chambers. These plots confirm that the requirement of \(p_{T}^{\mu}>6\) GeV on two muons introduces an effective cut of \(p_{T}>12\) GeV for the \(J/\psi\) and the efficiency with respect to \(\cos\theta^{*}\) is flat across the region between \(-0.8<\cos\theta^{*}<0.8\). The overall efficiencies calculated in the kinematic region of \(p_{T}^{J/\psi}>12\) GeV and \(|\eta^{J/\psi}|<2\) are 76.1% and 77.0% using the trigger decision and the trigger efficiency map, respectively, which is in agreement within the statistical and systematic errors. The size of the systematic errors may be improved by creating the efficiency map with finer granularity, which requires more statistics.

#### 6.2.3 Level-2 efficiency

The single muon level-2 efficiency can be defined in two ways: level-2 efficiency with respect to offline reconstruction (_L2/rec_) and level-2 efficiency with respect to level-1 (_L2/L1_). The _L2/rec_ efficiency is obtained in the same way as the efficiency with respect to level-1. The only difference is that the probe muon must have both level-1 and level-2 trigger objects associated to be considered as triggered.

For the calculation of the _L2/L1_ efficiency the set of probe muons is restricted to only those that have an associated level-1 RoI. This way the efficiency with respect to level-1 is obtained. Overall efficiencies as a function of \(p_{T}\) are shown in Figure 15. The points were fitted with the functional form of Equation 4. Efficiency curves calculated using all offline muons matched to generated muons are plotted in the same figure to check that the selection of probe muons is unbiased. It is clear that there is a good agreement between the measured efficiency and the direct Monte Carlo efficiency.

To calculate level-2 di-muon efficiency the _trigger efficiency map_ was created in the same way as for level-1. The \(\eta\)-\(\phi\) plane was divided into regions as described in Section 6.2.2 and in each region an efficiency curve was constructed and fitted with Equation 4. This was done for _L2/rec_ as well as for _L2/L1_ efficiencies.

Using the trigger efficiency map for the _L2/rec_ efficiency, we can calculate the level-2 trigger efficiency. To check that the map was created correctly, the single-muon efficiency curves were constructed using level-2 muons associated to the offline muons with the \(\Delta R\) matching criteria explained in Section 6.2.2. To get an agreement between the two methods one must use the same data sample. In Figure 16, open triangles represent a straightforward calculation of the efficiency using matched trigger objects while the solid circles are the efficiencies calculated using the map. To each offline muon from the sample the probability that it would be triggered was assigned using the map. In each \(p_{T}\) bin the efficiency was calculated as an average of these probabilities. Systematic uncertainties were estimated in the same way as the level-1 efficiency by changing the procedure to calculate the trigger efficiency map. The same method was used for other two variables \(\eta\) and \(\phi\). The two methods give an agreement within 6% in most regions while the difference gets as large as 15% at some regions (\(\phi\simeq-1,-2\)) where the efficiency is low and therefore the precision of the fit to create the trigger efficiency map was poor. Also, since the average efficiency is calculated in each bin of the map this causes discrepancies in the regions where efficiency changes rapidly.

The efficiency of the level-2 di-muon trigger for \(J/\psi\) was calculated in the same way as for level-1. Again two methods were used: firstly direct calculation using the trigger decision for the di-muon trigger and secondly using the efficiency map. Since a simple di-muon trigger without any cut on invariant mass

was used, all the muons in the sample must be used in calculation of the efficiency (not just those from \(J/\psi\) ). To each offline muon in the event the probability \(\epsilon_{i}\) that it would be triggered was assigned. The probability that the whole event will be triggered by the di-muon trigger is then

\[\epsilon^{2\mu}=1-\prod_{i}(1-\epsilon_{i})-\sum_{i}\epsilon_{i}\prod_{j\neq i} (1-\epsilon_{j}) \tag{5}\]

where the products and sums run over all decay muons used in the measurement.

The di-muon efficiency is calculated in the same way as the single-muon efficiency, as an average of probabilities \(\epsilon^{2\mu}\) in each bin of a given variable. In our case it is either the \(p_{T}\), \(\eta\), \(\phi\) or the \(\cos\theta^{*}\) of the \(J/\psi\) reconstructed in the event. Figure 17 shows a comparison of the \(J/\psi\) efficiency curves. Like the single muon efficiency results, the agreement between the two methods is within 6% in most regions except for some regions where the available statistics was low. The overall \(J/\psi\) efficiency (_L2/rec_) in the kinematic region, \(p_{T}^{J/\psi}>15\) GeV, \(|\eta^{J/\psi}|<2\) with the cuts on the muons (\(p_{T}^{\mu}>6\) GeV, \(|\eta^{\mu}|<2.4\)) is 69.2% and 69.4% using the trigger decision and the trigger efficiency map, respectively. We have a good agreement on the overall efficiency integrated in the above phase space.

In Figure 18 the efficiency as a function of the distance, \(\Delta R\), in the \(\eta-\phi\) plane between the two \(J/\psi\) muons is shown.

### Requirements on the trigger menu

In order to use the method developed here for real data, we need a large sample of \(J/\psi\) events with at least one muon unbiased by the trigger selection. The following selection criteria at each trigger level will satisfy this requirement:

**Level-1**: Single muon trigger above a certain threshold;
**Level-2**: \(J/\psi\) reconstruction within one RoI using the TrigDiMuon algorithm to enhance \(J/\psi\) events;
**Event Filter (EF)**: No further selection is imposed so as to avoid biasing the sample;

In this Section, we give some estimates of the statistics of the \(J/\psi\) sample using this trigger selection and show the precision on the trigger efficiency with a certain luminosity. Taking into account the limit on the EF output rate of 200 Hz it is plausible to use a few Hz of the bandwidth for this calibration trigger. The parameters to optimize are the prescale factor, to reduce the rate when it is too high, and the threshold value.

The level-1 single muon trigger rate has been studied in detail taking into account contributions from different sources. At low-\(p_{T}\), the main contribution is from \(K\)\(/\pi\) in-flight decay and muons from \(b\) and \(c\) quarks. The rejection of these non-\(J/\psi\) events by the topological di-muon trigger at level-2 has been studied using a genererated sample of \(b\bar{b}\rightarrow\mu+X\), where the efficiency of non-\(J/\psi\) events to be selected was found to be 0.8%. This factor is used to estimate the rate reduction by the level-2 selection.

Table 12 shows the expected rate of the level-1 single muon trigger and the contribution of the \(J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) to the rate assuming a luminosity of \(10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The rate of \(J/\psi\) events is the sum of \(J/\psi\) direct production and from \(b\bar{b}\) production. If we could allocate a bandwidth of 1 Hz to this trigger chain with 6 GeV level-1 threshold, we must apply a prescale factor of 3 to reduce the rate down to around 1 Hz. Given the fraction of \(J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) events among this rate is 6%, we get a rate of 0.06 Hz for collecting the calibration sample.

With one year of data, we expect to collect about 300 k \(J/\psi\) events according to this triggering strategy, which is comparable to the statistics used in this study (150 k direct \(J/\psi\) and 150 k \(b\bar{b}\rightarrow\)\(J/\psi\)). Therefore, we expect a similar performance (for \(\simeq\) 1 Hz calibration trigger rate) to that shown in Section 6.2 after the first year of data-taking. The number of events may increase if we allocate more than 1 Hz for the calibration trigger.

## 7 Conclusions

In this note we presented methods to efficiently select \(J/\psi\) events at the second level trigger, reject muons from \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays and measure the trigger efficiencies from the ATLAS data.

TrigDiMuon is a second-level trigger algorithm that selects efficiently at level-2 events which include \(J/\psi\) or other di-muon states, starting from a single level-1 muon trigger. The efficiency of TrigDiMuon for events accepted by level-1 and the level-2 single muon trigger is between 73% for the 4  trigger threshold and 60% for the 6 threshold. This may be compared with the topological di-muon trigger efficiencies of 33% for the 4  threshold and 15% for the 6 threshold. The fake trigger rates of TrigDiMuon are estimated to be 2 Hz for a trigger threshold of 4 at a luminosity of \(10^{31}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), and 90 Hz for a trigger threshold of 6  at a luminosity of \(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). For the \(B\)-physics trigger at \(L=10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) the rate will have to be further reduced by means of a decay length cut on the \(J/\psi\) decay vertex.

Extrapolating the muon track from MS back to the interaction vertex improves the single muon trigger selection at the level-2 stage and allows increased rejection of muons from \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays without a significant loss of efficiency for \(b\) events. The back extrapolator provides a further reduction factor of about 20% at the trigger threshold of 4 and of about 10% at the trigger threshold of 6 with respect to the output trigger rate of the baseline muComb selection. Despite this good performance, its use for triggering on low \(p_{T}\) di-muon objects is not recommended, since the background to TrigDiMuon is dominated by muons from \(b\) and \(c\) rather than by muon from \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays. However, because the rate of muons from \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays may be even higher than in our simulation, it is important to have it available for the single muon triggers.

The \(J/\psi\) trigger efficiency can be measured from ATLAS data using the tag-and-probe method. As the efficiency of the single muon trigger depends on the \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) regions, it is necessary to measure the efficiency as a function of these variables. With 300k \(J/\psi\) events, it is possible to measure the efficiency at level-1 and level-2 with better than 5 % precision for each region. The uncertainty comes mainly from the lack of statistics to measure the efficiencies for each region of \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) and will improve as more \(J/\psi\) events become available. To collect an unbiased \(J/\psi\) sample which can be used for the trigger efficiency measurement, we plan to use a level-1 single muon trigger with a \(J/\psi\) reconstruction using the inner detector at level-2. With this trigger we can collect around 300k events for an integrated luminosity of 100 pb\({}^{-1}\) while keeping the rate of this calibration trigger around 1 Hz.

With the methods provided it is possible to collect a large number of \(J/\psi\) events at luminosities of around \(10^{31}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), without an overly high rate from \(K\) and \(\pi\) decays. Furthermore, these low-\(p_{T}\)\(J/\psi\) events can also be used to calibrate trigger efficiencies from the actual ATLAS data, and provide the trigger efficiencies for analyses that use low-\(p_{T}\) muons.
