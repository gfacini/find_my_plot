ABSTRACT

We have developed an optical model for light collection in the TileCal geometry using bench measurement made on the individual components (clear and waveshifting fibers, old and new production tiles) taking into account the features of the tower-by-tower readout geometry. The results of this model are in fair agreement with the light yield measured for muons at 90\({}^{\circ}\) taken in the May 1995 testbeam. This model has then been applied to the prototype tile and readout geometry. We conclude that in the Module 0 prototype, the light yield per tile may be expected to be similar to that obtained in the test modules and that the longitudinal uniformity is largely unaffected by the differing tile sizes as a function of radius. No compelling need is found for the use of clear fiber welded to WLS fibers in the barrel readout where the fiber runs are expected to be less than about 2m. However, the significantly longer fiber lengths expected to be needed for the fiber routing in the extended barrel suggest that in this region the use of clear fiber welded to WLS fiber should be considered if it can be accomplished at an acceptable cost.

**1. Introduction**

This analysis was promoted by the observation that the optical system implementation envisaged for the Barrel 0 protoype is significantly different from that used in the current round of test modules. Whereas the current test modules have 18 cells of 10 cm in radius containing alternately scintillator and steel spacers, the Barrel 0 prototype has only 11 cells in radius and has a non-uniform radial structure (3 cells of 98mm, 3 cells of 128mm, 3 cells of 148mm and 2 cells of 188mm). In addition, a signle fiber reads out at most two tiles in the prototype geometry whereas it may read out up to three tiles in the test module geometry. Finally, there is the open question of the need to weld clear fiber to a shorter length of WLS fiber to increase the light yield per tile. It appears to us necessary, therefore, to have a model for the optical system in order extrapolate the data obtained from the testbeam modules to the Barrel 0 prototype and set constraints on the optical system components and fiber routing.

The bench measurements were made using a small sample of tiles and fibersused for the re-instrumentation of 2 test modules in the spring of 1995. The tiles are therefore from the 1994 production, have no grooves and are from the improved production batch. The fibers were both full length WLS multiclad Y11 fiber 1mm in diameter, and multiclad welded to clear single clad versions (with UV quencher in the WLS fiber). The characteristics of these components were measured using the 3 MeV energy selected ruthenium \(\beta\) source that we have available in the HEP division. The _in situ_ response was measured using the 150 GeV muon runs at 90\({}^{\circ}\) taken in the May testbeam period (acknowledging that in some runs, the module position compromised the interpretation of the data). The basic unit for comparison has been chosen to be the photo-electron yield.

## 2 Bench measurements of 1994 production tiles

A small sample of tiles from the 1994 production remained following the re-intrumentation of modules in the spring of 1995 and were brought back to Argonne for bench testing. The principal characteristic needed for the development of a model of the optical system is the tile light output, both its absolute value and the relative light yield as a function of tile size. Since at the time, some test samples of the new WLS fibers had not been received, the relative light yield of the tiles was measured using fibers on hand. A single 2.4m length of 1mm diameter BCF91A was coupled to both readout edges of a tile such that the length of fiber between the tile and the PMT was held constant at 85 cm. The length of the loop was chosen to approximate the reflectivity of the mirror on the true fibers through the attenuation in the loop. Both fibers were read out by the same PMT (a Hamamatsu R580-17, which has a green sensitive photocathode). The response to a 3 MeV \(\beta\) at the center of the tile was measured to characterise the light output for an average of three points, each representing the average response to 3000 tracks. Each tile in turn was read out using the same fiber. The results are given in Table 1 for the 9 tiles tested. The uncertainty in each individual measurement is estimated to be 5%.

Table 1: Tile light yield as a function of tile size for 1994 production Despite the very limited number of tiles tested, the results show a linear dependence on tile area (as expected from earlier measurements made for the SDC and for the CDF Endplug calorimeters [1, 2]). The SDC and CDF groups have also shown that the light yield is proportional to the length of readout fiber along the perimeter of the tile. This result will also be used in the optical model, although as yet no data from ATLAS tiles and their specific readout geometry is available to test its validity. In an attempt to obtain as much as possible from this limited data sample the data were fit to the straight line (Figure 1).

where L=20cm for the case of the test beam modules (corresponding to 2 fibers of 10cm each in length) and varies with tile position in the Barrel 0 prototype module. This result will be used to characterise the tile light yield as a function of tile radial position and readout fiber coupling.

## 3 Fiber and Fiber Coupling Effects

Although many fiber characteristics have been measured by TileCal groups in the last year or so, consistency measurements of fiber attenuation length and mirror reflectivity were made for the development of this model. In addition, two other effects were considered: splice transmission in the case of clear welded to WLS fibers, and the position of the tile relative to the mirrored end. The effective attenuation length of the WLS fiber used for the re-instrumentation of modules 3 & 4 was measured for three different fiber lengths (105, 156 and 202 cm) excited

in pairs by a standard tile. The readout ends of the fibers were carefully cut for these tests to reduce end effects in this measurement. The three points yield two estimates of the attenuation length : 240 cm & 290cm. These are consistent with other results and in fact in this model, the difference between 240cm and 290cm is minimal. In the model a value of 250cm is taken. The effective attenuation of the clear fiber was measured in a similar way, although clearly with limited precision. The measurements showed an attenuation length in the range 400cm to 700cm (taking into account the precision of the measurements). This range is used below to set bounds on the improvement in performance expected from the use of welding green to clear fiber. One characteristic which must be included in the optical system model,but which could not be measured here, is the average splice transmission. Since the splicing used the same device as has been used to fabricate the fibers for the CDF Endplug calorimeter, the average splice transmission was taken from their measurement of 91% [3]. A final feature of the test module optical readout is the ganging of tiles read out by the same fiber at different positions along the fiber length relative to the mirrored end. The signal from a standard tile was measured for the two possible tile positions in the test modules (1cm, 21cm and 41 cm from the mirrored end) relative to the signal for the case of the tile at 1cm from the mirrored end. The results are shown in Table 2. As a crosscheck on this result, one can compute the effect on the relative light yield if one assumes a fiber attenuation length and mirror reflectivity. The result of such a calculation for an assumed fiber attenuation length of 250cm is shown in Table 2 for three possible values of mirror reflectivity.

The calculated effect is qualitatively consistent with the measured data. However, there is relatively little sensitivity to the mirror reflectivity in this type of (non-destructive) measurement. The experimental data are used in the model rather than the above calculation since they include also other possible effects (such as the effect of the short attenuation length component).

## 4 Optical system model for test beam modules

The application of the basic component features to an optical system model of the test modules is quite straightforward. Ones simply applies the appropriate multiplicities factors as a function of tile layer: area dependence, fiber attenuation

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Tile Position & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Calculated Response} & Measured Response \\ \cline{2-5}  & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Mirror Reflectivity} & \\  & 100\% & 80\% & 70\% & \\ \hline
1cm & 1.000 & 1.000 & 1.000 & 1.000 \\
21cm & 1.003 & 1.012 & 1.018 & 1.005 \\

\end{table}

and the effect of tile location. Note that for this system one does not even require L/A scaling since all tiles have identical lengths of readout fiber. The light yield as a function of tile number is shown in Table 3, for the case of full length WLS fiber readout. The attenuation length of the WLS fiber has been taken to be 250cm for this calculation. The remarkable feature of this result is that despite differences of order 40% from both tile size and fiber attenuation, the net light yield as a function of tile number is quite uniform. Moreover, within each PMT block, the uniformity is even better and is likely of order 3%.

In principal, the extension of this model to the case of WLS welded to green fibers can be accomplished by simply accounting for the loss of signal in transmission through the splice and the expected increase in signal from the increased attenuation length. This is shown in Table 4 as a function of calorimeter depth under two assumptions for the attenuation length of clear fiber.

The absolute light yield for Tile J1 (size 1) was measured for the case of readout by a pair of full length WLS fibers and by the corresponding pair of WLS welded to clear fibers (in which the relevent length of clear fiber is about 180cm). The light yield obtained was 1.65 pe's and 1.51 pe's respectively. That is to say, instead of seeing an increase in light, a decrease in light is observed. This loss of light could be occurring in several places (poor quality clear fiber, poor splicing or poor mirroring). However, the clear fiber is single clad, unlike the multiclad WLS fiber which is multiclad. The accepted reason for the reduction in light is the difference in trapping angle,which is about 5\({}^{\circ}\) for multiclad fiber compared to only about 3\({}^{\circ}\) for the single clad fiber. This difference would in itself contribute to a loss of about 40% in light and has been confirmed by direct measurements [4].

**4. Optical system model for the Barrel 0 Prototype**

The application of the basic component features to an optical system model of the Barrel 0 prototype is also straightforward. For simplicity (and in accordance with the present baseline design) we assume full length WLS fiber readout of the tiles. The principal difference with respect to the testbeam modules is in the differences in tile sizes (which brings into play L/A scaling in light yield). However, the radial size of the Barrel 0 prototype is about 25cm less than the test modules. This, in principal, can result in a corresponding reduction in light attenuation of 10% if one assumes similar fiber routing constraints in the two cases, but does not affect the relative light yield within a tower. Since the routing into the PMT will be different in the drawer system, we have chosen not to include this factor in the calculation of the expected light yield (i.e. we assume that this 25cm of fiber will be needed to route into the drawers). A linear extrapolation has been used to model the effect of tile position when two tiles are read out using the same fiber. Assuming identical photocathode response the light yield as a function of layer number in the Barrel 0 prototype module relative to tile 1 in the test module is shown in Table 5.

The model indicates that we might expect about a 10% reduction in overall light yield from tiles in the Barrel 0 prototype. This is primarily a result of the

larger tile sizes from the increase in inner radius. Again the net uniformity is good (in fact it appears to be better than in the test modules). However, this is a result of L/A scaling which is cancelling the reduction in light attenuation as a function of tile position. This has not yet been adequately tested, since the test module tiles had identical readout lengths and have a maximum area only half of what we will have in the prototype.

An additional cause for concern is the quantum efficiency of the photocathode. Figure 2 compares the published quantum efficiencies of an XP 2012 with that of an R5900. One sees a slightly lower quantum efficiency at the blue wavelengths for the R5900. However when one integrates the response with the Y11 emission spectrum, the expected decrease in light yield is only 8%. Furthermore, we know that the quantum efficiencies will vary widely from PMT to PMT compared with the manufacturer's spec sheet so basing any conclusions on the published quantum efficiencies is not reliable, except that we expect the R5900 to perform approximately as does the XP 2012.

## 5 Tile signal from testbeam muons at 90\({}^{\circ}\).

The average light yield per tile (within a tower and depth) can also be easily measured using the response to muons at 90\({}^{\circ}\) in the testbeam. The data analysed so far come from the May 1995 run, which allow all of the features and options for

tiles & fibers to be studied simultaneously. The datasets used were :

* D at asset 1: Runs 30580-30598 : Module 3
* D at asset 2: Runs 30601-30624 : Module 4
* D at asset 3: Runs 30627-30655 : Module 2
* D at asset 4: Runs 31189-31214 : Module 3

The number of photo-electrons per 150 GeV muon traversing the calorimeter has been estimated using the two st andard approaches

\[N_{pe}=2\times\left[\frac{\mu(\frac{(L+R)}{2})}{\sigma(\frac{(L-R)}{2})} \right]^{2} \tag{2}\]

\[N_{pe}=\frac{2}{\sigma^{2}(log(\frac{L}{R}))} \tag{3}\]

where L (R) is the signal from the summed signal from one side of a single calorimeter depth (subdivided into towers as appropriate). The two methods do not agree overly well. The photo-electron yield obtained using Equation 2 is systematically higher than that obtained using Equation 3 by about 20%. We do not understand this and since it appears plausibly less sensitive to systematic pedestal variations and to be conservative, we take the light yield given by Equation 3.

The light yield in photo-electrons as given by Equation 3, as a function of tile number (beginning with 1 at the inner radius) and calorimeter tower is shown in Table 6 for module 3 (dataset 1). The variation in light yield is clearly much larger than one might have expected. An obvious question is that of the reproducibilty of the result. Table 7 shows the photo-electron yields measured in Module 3 using the second set of runs (dataset 4). The data is graphically presented by layer in Figure 3. Although some PMT's are seen to have changed significantly (primarily due to a table positioning error in dataset 1), the agreement between data sets is at the few percent level. An obvious possible cause for the large variation in light yield is the differences associated with different PMTs. In Figure 4, we show the light yield per PMT tower in Module 3 for dataset 4, normalised globally over all PMTs in module 3 and normalised PMT-pair by PMT-pair. A significant reduction in the rms variation is seen, from which we can conclude the PMTs are indeed contributing to the spread in response (either directly or through their coupling to any individual fiber bundle). A similar effect is seen in both the muon response (Figure 5) and the ratio of muon response to photo-electron yield (Figure 6), where in this analysis the muon response has been characterised by a truncated mean at 2 GeV. Figure 6 also shows the interesting feature that the rms variation of the ratio distribution is smaller than that of the individual distributions, indicating a correlation between the muon response and photo- electron yield. This is probably explainable in termsof the calibration procedure, which can only set the HV to accomodate the average response within a tower rather than layer by layer. In relation to the model which we had hoped to develop, however, the data are such that the lack of an absolute reference scale (due to the large PMT to PMT variation) precludes the beam data being a good test of the systematic changes in light yield arising from the basic component properties. However,it is reasonable to conclude that they are smaller than the other variations in the system.

## 5 Absolute light yield in testbeam and bench measurements

The test modules studied in the May 95 period had several different fabrication characteristics. The average photo-electron yield per tower as a function of tower and module is shown in Table 8. This shows the improvement in response in Module 3 and Module 4 (although it should be noted that the data shown here for Module 4 is compromised by a table positioning error.) The light yield in Module 3, Tower 1 is only marginally better than the average in the remaining 4 towers and therefore one concludes that the use of clear welded to WLS fiber has not resulted in the 40% increase in light expected. This, as was discussed in section 3, is due to

the clear fiber being single-clad.

The photo-electron yield measured in Module 3 has an average value of 1.3 pe's/tile for 150 GeV muons. The bench measurements made using a 3 MeV source gave a value of 1.7 pe/mip. Since the energy loss for 150 GeV muons is larger than that for "mips" by a factor of approximately 1.5 [5], the apparent discrepency is even larger. In addition to (our own possible errors) there may be a difference resulting from different PMT types - we expect the quantum efficiency of the R580-17 to be roughly 30% higher than that of an XP2012. This is also an indication of unexpectedly large variations between PMT's and in other aspects of the optical system (for example the apparent large tile to tile variation, which may indicate problems in tile-fiber coupling). At present, we do not understand this and hope that our colleagues in the TileCal group can provide some enlightenment. We do not consider a factor of 2 agreement between testbeam and bench measurements acceptable, since in the past the bench setup has been proven to give reliable data for photo-electron yield [6] and indicates that we are losing light in some unidentified way.

The photo-electron yield as a function of deposited energy can be calculated in a number of ways from these data a (all of which give slightly different answers). The present TileCal approach uses the electron calibration of 5.59 pC/GeV to convert pe/pC measured using muons into pe/GeV for the calorimeter response to hadrons and electrons. For Module 4, we measure 55 pe/GeV using this technique for the light yield estimated using the logarithm of the left-right ratio with a statistical uncertainty of 5%. This result is similar to what may be obtained from the calorimeter sampling fraction. The light yield estimated using the ratio of mean and rms is approximately 20% higher and we have also observed a sensitivity to calibration constants at the 5-10% level. Thess differences set a scale to the systematic

uncertainty, which we consider to be of the order of 20%.

## 6 Conclusions

Using bench measurements on components, we have developed a model to estimate the light output as seen by the PMT for both the test module optical geometry and the Barrel 0 prototype (using plausible assumptions regarding fiber routing). This model predicts that we should see roughly comparable performance from the prototype compared to the test modules in terms of light yield. In both cases this model predicts relatively small tile-to-tile variations resulting from differences in fiber length and tile area. Analysis of the 150 GeV data taken at 90\({}^{\circ}\) in the May 95 testbeam, shows a much larger variation from calorimeter tower to tower than would be expected if it were wholly due to the propogation properties of light in the tiles and fibers. The data show a large PMT correlation. However, it is also possible that significant contributions to the variation are coming from the fiber-tile coupling and the light mixer. This is not understood (by us) and warrants further study. The towers instrumented with clear fiber welded to the WLS fiber are not observed to have significantly improved light yield. This can almost wholly be understood in terms of the loss of light through coupling of multiclad WLS fiber to single clad clear fiber. It is not yet clear to us whether the gain from using multiclad clear fiber is justified for use in the barrel region. It is however, likely that the longer fiber runs required by tower routing in the extended barrel will make its use mandatory in this region. Both these questions hinge on the determination of the absolute light yield. Our bench measurements indicate that the light yield achieved in the testbeam is about a factor of 2 below that which we might expect as a maximum. In addition, we measure a signal of approximately 0.85 photo-electrons per minimally ionising particle per tile (after correction for the increased energy loss of the 150GeV muons used to make the measurement [5]). This is close to the nominal minimum performance suggested for a hadron calorimeter [7] and should be given careful consideration before deciding on the readout design.
