**Abstract**

In this paper we will discuss a possible solution for cooling a large silicon detector system. The idea is to use evaporation cooling from liquid films deposited directly on the VLSI circuits. The intention is to feed liquid to each individual VLSI, using a combination of a liquid pipe line and a wick structure. The liquid which is deposited on the VLSI is then evaporated into an atmosphere which is consisting of vapor and possibly nitrogen.

In the paper we will be concerned with the heat transfer from liquid films deposited on silicon test chips. The experiments have been performed under different atmospheres. We have used both purely vapor and a mixed vapor and nitrogen atmosphere. The total pressure and thereby the liquid saturation temperature was varied during the different experiments. To increase the heat transfer coefficient at low heat fluxes we have also introduced different modifications of the silicon surface in some of the experiments.

**Introduction**

The cooling of a silicon intertracker detector for the proposed Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Cern is a most demanding task. This detector system consists of six or seven layers of double sided silicon detector briquettes, over a total area of more than 10m\({}^{2}\). The whole detector will be installed inside a "cylinder" having a diameter less than 0.8 m, and a total length of between 1.0 and 1.5 m. There is about 10 million individual detectors, and in the order of 100 000 VLSI circuits for signal amplification and read out [1]. A total power of between 10 and 15 kV is mainly dissipated by the readout circuits (VLSI), with a heat flux of approximately 0.4 W/cm\({}^{2}\). The temperature in the detector system must be kept within a small temperature interval which is in the order of a few degrees. This is partly due to mechanical requirement which is a dimensional stability in the order of 10um. Probably more important is the annealing effects in the silicon detectors them selves, changing their electrical characteristics due to the influence of an extremely high radiation flux.

To reduce the interaction (absorption and scattering) between the radiation and the mechanical structure, a minimum of mass is required in the detector system. From the same reason, materials with a low atomic number (Eg. low Z-materials) must be used. A high magnetic field (-20 000 Gauss), with a B-vector parallel to the cylinder axis is also present.

At the present stage different cooling principles have been proposed for the detector. This includes forced convection cooling using helium gas or water, and evaporative cooling using dielectric liquid.

In this paper we will discuss one possible solution using evaporative cooling from liquid films deposited directly on the VLSI. The intention is to feed liquid to each individual VLSI, using a combination of a pipe line and a wick-structure. The liquid is then evaporated into an atmosphere which is consisting of vapor and nitrogen. The paper will deal with the heat transfer from the liquid films deposited on silicon test chips both from a conceptual and an experimental point of view.

The experiments have been performed under different atmospheres, where we have used both pure vapor and a mixed vapor and nitrogen. Forced convection of the atmosphere has not been introduced, but the total pressures have been varied during the experiments. To increase the heat transfer coefficient at low heat fluxes we have introduced different modifications of the silicon surface in some of the experiments.

The use of a wick structure is proposed due to the problems involved in manufacturing and maintenance of a large number (100 000) nozzles for impingement cooling. A single wick can be used for the cooling of an array of VLSI circuits. The reliability will probably also increase due to the redundancy of different liquid flow paths.

Theory

Two different modes of cooling must be considered when cooling a VLSI circuit by a thin (in the order of a few hundred microns) liquid layer flowing on the surface. At low heat fluxes, the heat is transported into the liquid by diffusion and convection. Generally the heat absorbed by the liquid will increase the internal energy (the temperature) of the liquid. The increased temperature will also increase the evaporation from the liquid surface. Analysis shows however that the effect of evaporation directly from the liquid surface will correspond to a heat transfer coefficient which is three orders of magnitudes less than what is given by the heat capacity of the liquid [4]. This is due to a stationary vapor atmosphere in the present experiments. The effect of surface evaporation can therefore be neglected.

When the heat flux increases vapor bubbles are formed inside the liquid, at or very close to the heater surface. These introduce a new mode of cooling, where the combined heat of evaporation and the increased mass transport increases the cooling capabilities significantly. This mode is usually called nucleate boiling.

The liquid used during these experiments was the Fluorocarbon liquid FC-87 made by 3M. The liquid properties are given in Table 1. Given a low surface tension liquid as in the present experiments, the point of transition into nucleate boiling will be very dependent on the surface structure and material properties. This effect is well known from pool boiling [2, 3], where it has been a serious limitation in the use of evaporation cooling in electronic systems.

Before we continue with our discussion of nucleate boiling, we will look into what happens during the first mode of cooling.

Impingement cooling

During the impingement cooling, a free liquid surface is exposed on top of the VLSI. This temperature gradient creates surface tension induced convection in the liquid. The Marangoni number (B) which is used to characterize this type of convection is given by [5]

\[\text{B = \backslash F((6\sigma/8T)\Delta Td,\rho va)} \tag{1}\]

An estimate of the buoyancy driven heat convection can be found by the Rayleigh's number which is defined as [6]

\[\text{Ra = \backslash F(g\beta Td^{3},va)} \tag{2}\]

The ratio B/Ra in Fig. 1 shows the relative importance between surface tension driven and buoyancy driven convection. With a liquid layer thickness in the order of two or three hundred microns the heat transfer due to buoyancy can therefore be neglected.

During impingement cooling, convective currents are introduced due to the impingement velocity. Both the surface tension induced convection and the convection introduced by the impingement will participate in the mixing of the liquid on the VLSI. Due to these combined convective currents the liquid temperature will probably be quite homogenous when it leaves the heater surface.

To calculate the heat transfer coefficient in impingement cooling we also assume an infinite good contact between the heater surface and the liquid. The heat flux is then given by

\[\text{q}^{-}=\text{\backslash F(c_{\text{p}}V^{-}\rho,A)} \tag{3}\]

Wick cooling

A "wick" in this paper consists of a cotton cylinder with one flat end on the silicon chip surface. Introducing this wick the liquid velocity in the direction vertical to the test chip suface is reduced by two orders of magnitude. Also the free surface of the liquid on the Si chip which is outside the wick structure is reduced. Due to this very much reduced flow speed, and the reduced free surface we assume the convective currents to be negligible. The result is a laminar flow, with very-little mixing between the different "layers". Thermal diffusion will therefore be the dominating source for heat-transfer during wick cooling

To discuss the effect of thermal diffusion, let us consider a simplified physical model. A liquid layer of thickness d is in contact with the heating surface. Initially there is a uniform temperature T\({}_{0}\) in the system. At time =0, the heating surface temperature is raised to T\({}_{1}\). The temperature gradient across the liquid layer in z-direction, and the heat flux into the liquid can now be solved as a function of time [6]. This is used to evaluate the total amount of heat absorbed by the liquid during a time t = 0. The liquid is initially at a temperature T\({}_{0}\) when brought in contact with a heat source having a uniform temperature of T\({}_{1}\). We choose the time t\({}_{0}\) to be equal to the total transport time of the liquid

equal to the saturation temperature of the liquid. The only exception is the two curves in Fig. 6 where nitrogen was introduced into the test container.

The figures clearly show two different cooling modes with a substantially difference in the slope of the curve of heat flux versus over-temperature. At heat-fluxes below 1-2 W/cm\({}^{2}\), the heat was transported into the liquid by thermal diffusion or convection without any nucleate boiling. In fact the over-temperature in this mode corresponds to the superheat of the liquid. At higher heat-fluxes, the introduction of nucleate boiling changed the slope of the curve of heat flux versus over-temperature. In this mode nucleate boiling become the dominating mode of heat transfer.

Erosion of the "coated" test chips was observed after some hours of impingement cooling. The stainless steel powder in the splash zone was removed, but there were no sign of erosion on the silicon itself.

Thermal diffusion and convection

From Fig. 5 we see that during the thermal diffusion / convection mode the impingement cooling had a heat-transfer coefficient which was roughly 50% higher than when using a wick structure. From the results it seems as if the "surface" of the test chip had no significant influence on the heat transfer coefficient during this cooling mode. Fig. 4. The presence of nitrogen did not either seem to make any difference in the heat transfer coefficient. The small difference seen in Fig 6 is due to a 15% reduced liquid flow speed.

Transition to nucleate boiling

The transition from convective to nucleate boiling heat-transfer was obtained with a heat flux of between 0.7 and 2.5 W/cm\({}^{2}\). This corresponds to a liquid superheat of between 10 and 25\({}^{\circ}\)C. The transition was influenced by:

A) The use of impingement or wick cooling (Fig. 5)

B) The "surface" of the testchip (Fig. 4)

C) The degree of sub-cooling of the liquid (Fig. 6)

It was generally observed that impingement cooling gave a smooth transition into nucleate boiling for both the "non-coated" and the "coated" test chips, see Fig. 5 and 9. The transition occurred however at lower over-temperatures and heat-fluxes for the test chips which were "coated" compared to the "non-coated".

In the similar experiments with wick structures, there were observed large differences in behavior between the "non-coated" and the "coated" test chip. The "coated" test chip showed a very smooth transition into nucleate boiling. This transition occurred at a heat-flux and over-temperature which were lower than observed for any of the tests on impingement

cooling. For the "non-coated" test chips the transition was on the contrary much more dramatic. In this case the transition also occurred at much higher heat-fluxes and over-temperatures. We observed significant "thermal overshoots" during these experiments, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. In Table 2 we have compared the observed over-temperatures before nucleate boiling for all experiments.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline  & Over-temperature \\ \hline Wick "non-coated" & 15-25 \({}^{\circ}\)C \\ \hline Wick "coated" & 10-18 \({}^{\circ}\)C \\ \hline Imp. "non-coated" & 18-22 \({}^{\circ}\)C \\ \hline Imp. "coated" & 15-18 \({}^{\circ}\)C \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Discussion

Wick cooling

A model for the heat transfer during wick cooling has been discussed earlier, Eq. 4-6. The reduction in heat transfer coefficient which was expected from this model was clearly observed in Fig. 5. In Fig. 7 we have calculated of the ratio Q\({}^{*}\)(t\({}_{0}\))/Q\({}^{*}\)(t\({}_{\infty}\)) from Eq. 5 for a liquid flow rate of 0.18 ml/s.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline  & "Heat transf. coeff." \\  & (dq/dT) \\ \hline Wick "non-coated" & = 0.35 W/cm\({}^{2}\)K \\ \hline Imp. "non-coated" & = 0.35 W/cm\({}^{2}\)K \\ \hline Imp. "coated" & = 0.6 W/cm\({}^{2}\)K \\ \hline Pool boiling & = 3.0 W/cm\({}^{2}\)K [2] \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Figure 6. The influence of a partial pressure of 0.6 bar of nitrogen. The flow speed was 0.18 ml/s during the experiment without, and 0.15 ml/s in the experiment with nitrogen Nuclear boiling When nucleate boiling was introduced the slope of the heat-flux versus temperature curve (dq\({}^{*}\)/dT) increased by a factor of approximately 4 using a wick. The difference in heat-transfer coefficient between "un-coated" a "coated" testchip was small.

dimensional flow pattern of the liquid would have given a better agreement between calculated and observed values.

Impingement coolingIn Fig. 8 we have plotted the heat flux versus temperature for impingement cooling (from Fig. 5) and compared it to the theoretical results from Eq. 3. The measured result is very close to what was predicted by this model. This confirms the assumption that the convective currents due to surface tension and the impingement have given a homogeneous mixing of the liquid.

In the experiment where a partial pressure of 0.6 bar of nitrogen was introduced into the container the saturation temperature of the liquid was changed from approximately 30\({}^{\circ}\)C until 42\({}^{\circ}\)C. This accounts for the observed shift in the transition temperature.

Nucleate boilingThe heat heat transfer coefficients observed during nucleate boiling were significantly smaller than what we previously have observed in pool boiling. This was expected due to that the liquid film thickness was small compared with the bubble size at departure from the test chip.

We observed an increased heat transfer coefficient during impingement cooling on "coated" surfaces. This can be explained by the assumption that the combination of high liquid flow-speed and stainless steel particles will introduce many nucleation centers. Generally it is assumed that the heat-transfer coefficient is a monotone increasing function of the number of nucleation centers [7].

ConclusionsThe experiments have shown that impingement generally gave better results for cooling than using a wick. On the other hand, for a large array of VLSI circuits wick cooling

will probably be more convenient both from a manufacturing and a reliability point of view.

During impingement cooling we observed a good agreement between the theoretical and the measured results. The same was also the case for wick cooling.

The heat transfer coefficients during nucleate boiling were significantly reduced compared to pool boiling. This is probably because the bubble diameter at departure from the test chip was larger than the thickness of the liquid layer.

Due to a stagnant layer of vapor during the experiments, evaporation from the surface of the liquid was of negligible influence on the results.

Further work

The work so far has shown that it could be possible to cool a silicon inertracker detector for the proposed Large Hadron Collider (LHC). To be feasible for this application the liquid flow over the heat sources must be significantly decreased. To make a detector system based on transpiration cooling a well controlled flow of inert gas must be purged across the evaporating liquid. This will increase the convective mass transport dramatically. On the other hand, to emphesize nucleation boiling, further work must be done to reduce the over temperature before transition to nucleate boiling.
