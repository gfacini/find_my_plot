Introduction

Precise reconstruction of the jet energy is a fundamental ingredient of many physics analyses at the LHC, such as the determination of the top quark mass, the reconstruction of dijet resonances, and the measurement of the inclusive jet cross-section. Moreover the performance obtained on jet reconstruction has a direct impact on the quality of the measurement of the missing transverse energy which will play a decisive role in many searches for new physics at the LHC.

The ultimate goal of the jet energy measurement is, in most cases, the reconstruction of the initial parton momentum. On the other hand, the measurement in the ATLAS detector starts from signals recorded in the calorimeter cells which have been calibrated at the _electromagnetic_ (EM) scale. This scale is set in test beams and is defined to reproduce correctly the electron energy in the beams.

A subsequent software jet calibration procedure is performed in two major steps. First, corrections are made for detector effects, in particular calorimeter non-compensation, noise, losses in dead material and cracks, longitudinal leakage and particle deflection in the magnetic field. The procedure is described in Ref. [1]. After this step the _hadronic scale_ which provides the jet energy at the _particle level_ is obtained, i.e. it should correspond to the jet energy obtained after running the same jet algorithm over all true momenta of the final state particles in the event. Throughout this note, we will refer to these jets as "particle-level jets" or "truth jets". At the second step physics effects, such as clustering, fragmentation, initial and final state radiation (ISR and FSR), underlying event (UE) and pile-up are considered. After that the _final scale_ is reached which corresponds to the energy at the _parton level_. These effects can depend on the type of interaction, e.g. they can differ for quark and gluon jets, can depend on the parton momentum scales and multiparton interactions, so that an individual study may be necessary for each data analysis involving jets.

The validation of the whole jet calibration has to be performed _in-situ_ using suitable physics processes. In the course of in-situ validation (also called in-situ calibration) the systematic uncertainty of the hadronic energy scale is determined, and the final tuning of this scale is possibly performed. Furthermore, the level of physics effects affecting the final scale is estimated. In addition, the jet energy resolution can be determined in-situ.

The validation procedure will start with QCD dijet events, which allow us to check the uniformity of the calibration as a function of azimuth \(\phi\) and of pseudo-rapidity \(\eta\). The uniformity in \(\phi\) can be checked by studying jet rates; the uniformity in \(\eta\) can be validated using \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance between the jets. The dijet events also open two ways of determining the jet energy resolution.

After a uniform detector response is obtained, the absolute hadronic energy scale will be studied using \(\gamma\) or \(Z+\mathrm{jet}\) events, in which the \(Z\) boson is reconstructed via the \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) or \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decay. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance between the jet and the boson in such events will be used to relate the hadronic scale of the jets to the well understood energy of electromagnetic objects.

At very high jet energies, the statistics of \(\gamma/Z+\mathrm{jet}\) events vanishes. After the validation of the absolute jet energy scale (JES) with these events in a limited \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range, the scale at higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) will be validated using QCD multijet events by balancing the momentum of the leading jet to the momentum sum of the other jets. Alternatively, it can be inferred from the opening angle between the two leading charged particle tracks associated with the jet.

These methods are discussed in the present note. Expectations of several Monte Carlo programs are compared for various jet algorithms. The statistical and systematic uncertainties of the methods are assessed with an emphasis on the first \(100\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) and \(1\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of ATLAS data. It is important to note that one missing contribution is the precision with which the Monte Carlo is tuned to and reproduces the data. This, naturally, can only be determined once data are available.

Several related studies are covered in other notes. The determination of JES from the invariant mass of the \(W\) boson in \(W\to qq\) decays is covered in Ref. [2]. The study of jet fragmentation and of the underlying event using tracks associated with the jets and in the complete event is discussed in Ref. [3]. The measurement of \(E/p\) for isolated charged particle tracks in order to study the response of the calorimeter is considered in [4].

This note is organized as follows. First, the Monte Carlo programs used for the present studies are briefly described. Then, the standard ATLAS jet reconstruction and calibration procedure is outlined. Afterward, we discuss the basic features of \(\gamma\) and \(Z+\mathrm{jet}\) events and of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance calibration technique, the physics effects influencing the calibration procedure, the limitations of the underlying models and the expected systematic and statistical uncertainties of the jet energy scale. Subsequently, we consider the calibration techniques in QCD dijet and multijet events, followed by the methods of determination of the jet energy resolution. A summary is given at the end of the note.

## 2 Monte Carlo event generators

The general-purpose Monte Carlo programs herwig, pythia and alpgen are used here to model the final states at the LHC energies. The event generation relies on phenomenological approaches to describe the processes which occur at all levels apart from calculation of the matrix elements. This is done by factorizing the event generation into several stages:

* hard subprocess at a fixed order of perturbation theory,
* initial and final state QCD radiation using parton shower models,
* multiple parton interactions (MI) contributing to the underlying event (UE),
* hadronization (fragmentation).

pythia and herwig include leading order (\(2\to 2\)) matrix elements for generating \(\gamma\)/\(Z+\mathrm{jet}\) and QCD dijet events. Higher order QCD effects are modeled using parton showers, which can be insufficient to describe hard QCD radiation. These effects may significantly affect the event kinematics and thus spoil the determination of the jet energy scale and resolution. They are checked using alpgen which includes leading order matrix elements for generating multiparton final states. alpgen simulations are also used in addition to pythia to study multijet events at very high transverse momenta, where such events provide the main means to determine the jet energy scale.

### pythia

pythia 6.4[5] is used with the on-shell leading order (LO) matrix element to model the final states. Higher-order QCD effects are simulated in the leading-logarithmic approximation with initial- and final-state radiation following the DGLAP evolution [6]. Coherence effects from soft-gluon interference are included. The underlying event has been tuned to reproduce the CDF data. The parton density functions (PDF) CTEQ6ll [7] are used for the proton.

The initial-state shower is based on backward evolution to the shower initiators. Initial and final state showers are matched to each other by maximum emission cones. The Lund string fragmentation model is used to produce the final state hadrons. The string model is based on linear confinement, where (anti-)quarks or other color (anti-)triplets are located at the ends of the string, and gluons are energy momentum carrying kinks on the string. When the invariant mass of a string piece gets small enough, it is identified as a hadron, thus the whole system eventually evolves into hadrons.

### Herwig

herwig 6.510 [8] is used in conjunction with the underlying event generator jimmy 4.31 [9]. As with pythia, the CTEQ6ll set is used for the proton PDFs. herwig uses the parton shower approach for initial and final state QCD radiation, including color coherence effects and azimuthal correlations both within and between the jets. It includes the angular ordered parton shower algorithm which re-sums both soft and collinear singularities. herwig uses the cluster fragmentation model [10, 11], where all the outgoing gluons are first split into quark/anti-quark or diquark/anti-diquark pairs. Then, quarks are combined with their nearest neighbor (in the color field) anti-quark or diquark to form color singlet clusters. These clusters have mass and spatial distributions peaked at relatively low values. For large cluster masses, the \(q-\)distributions fall rapidly and are asymptotically independent of the hard subprocess scale. If a cluster is too light to decay into two hadrons, it is allowed to become the lightest hadron of the relevant flavor. A similar cluster model is also used to model soft and underlying hadronic events.

### alpgen

alpgen 2.06 [12] is used with the herwig parton shower and the jimmy underlying event model and with the subsequent herwig cluster fragmentation. Similarly to pythia and herwig simulations, the CTEQ6ll set is used for the proton PDFs. Each final state parton multiplicity is generated individually by alpgen. A matching using a given scheme between a generated parton with the parton shower is performed in order to avoid double counting of the jet multiplicity. We use the MLM matching scheme.

## 3 Jet reconstruction in ATLAS

Several jet collections are built during event reconstruction in ATLAS, varying the input to the jet finder and the jet finding algorithm. The inputs considered for the jet finder are "calorimeter towers" (calo-towers) and "topological clusters" (topoclusters). In addition, "truth particles" are used for simulated events. Calorimeter towers are built from all calorimeter cells contained in a region of \((\mathrm{d}\eta\times\mathrm{d}\phi)\) of size \((0.1\times 0.1)\). The initial cell energy is calibrated at the EM scale. Topological clusters are built according to criteria that identify significant energy deposits in topologically connected cells. Three different levels of signal significance are applied to the seed, the neighboring and peripheral cells. Currently, the settings of \((4,2,0)\) in units of sigma of noise are used [1].

The jet finder methods used are cone and \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) algorithms. The seeded cone algorithm is used with radii of \(R=0.4\) or \(0.7\), \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of seeds \(=1\,\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\), and a split/merge fraction of \(0.5\). The inclusive \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) algorithm (fast version) is run with a \(D\) parameter of \(0.4\), \(0.6\) or \(1.0\)[3].

Two calibration approaches are developed in ATLAS, the "global" and the "local" schemes [1]. The global scheme uses H1-style weights [1] to correct calorimeter cells after jet finding. The weights are based on the energy density in a cell. This calibration is specific to each type of jet finder. In the local scheme, jets are built from pre-calibrated topoclusters, which already include hadronic calibration, as well as dead material and out-of-cluster corrections. In this note, we report on the "global" scheme2).

Footnote 2: The local scheme approach was not yet fully developed when studies reported here were done; this approach will be studied and compared to the global scheme in the future.

For most of the studies, a minimum transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of at least \(10\,\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) is required for a jet to be considered in the data analysis.

In-situ studies using \(\gamma\!/Z+\!\) jet events

### Electromagnetic final state in \(\gamma\!/Z+\!\) jet events

The \(Z\) boson is observed via its \(Z\to ee\) or \(Z\to\mu\mu\) decay products. The good lepton identification capability of the ATLAS detector allows reconstruction of \(Z\) decays with very low background [13].

Before comparing the jet energy scales in data and in simulation using \(\gamma\!/Z+\!\) jet events, basic \(p_{\rm T}\) and \(\eta\) spectra of the vector bosons have to be checked. These spectra are affected mainly by the efficiency of photon or lepton identification, and by the trigger efficiency. In the case of \(\gamma\) production, significant background due to misidentified jets in QCD dijet events remains despite the rejection power of the detector and of the reconstruction algorithms. The theoretical systematic uncertainties associated with the vector bosons are expected to be small at all levels. The effects on transverse momentum due to additional photon radiation at the hadron level are predicted to be negligible.

### Use of \(p_{\rm T}\) balance

In leading order of perturbation theory the final state of \(\gamma\!/Z+\!\) jet events can be considered as a two-body system in which the transverse momentum of the jet \(p_{\rm T,jet}\) is exactly balanced by the transverse momentum of the vector boson \(p_{\rm T,\,\gamma}\) or \(p_{\rm T,\,Z}\). The \(p_{\rm T}\) balance can thus be defined as

\[B_{1}=\frac{p_{\rm T,jet}}{p_{\rm T,\,\gamma/Z}}-1. \tag{1}\]

However in reality, these events contain more than one jet in the final state at parton, particle and detector level, so that considering only the leading (highest \(p_{\rm T}\)) jet is in general too crude an approximation of the event kinematics. This is one of the major issues in this study and requires a detailed understanding of jet multiplicities, as well as their \(p_{\rm T}\) and angular spectra. The Monte Carlo models will have to be tuned to reproduce these jet properties and their energy dependence as observed with the data. A striking example of the current uncertainty in modeling these quantities is shown in Fig. 1, in which the average multiplicity of jets in \(Z+\!\) jet events, generated using pythia and herwig, is depicted as a function of the transverse momentum of the \(Z\) boson.

Cone jets reconstructed with \(R=0.7\) at the particle level with

Figure 1: Mean jet multiplicity for jets with \(p_{\rm T}>10\) GeV as a function of \(p_{\rm T}\) of the \(Z\) boson in \(Z+\!\) jet events.

\(p_{\rm T}>10\) GeV in the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<5\) are used. herwig predicts a larger number of jets than pythia mainly due to its mechanism of cluster formation and the assumptions used to model soft and underlying hadronic events. Further extensive studies have been performed in order to understand the differences in the basic jet distributions at the parton and the particle level for various jet algorithms, and to quantify the influence of initial and final state radiation and of the underlying event model.

A very useful quantity to consider is the azimuthal angular difference \(\Delta\phi\) between the boson and the leading jet. It provides information about the event topology and is sensitive to additional physics effects, like initial state radiation and final state radiation. Figure 2 shows the \(\Delta\phi\) distribution at parton and at hadron level for three jet algorithms in \(\gamma+\rm{jet}\) events with multiple interactions switched on and off, respectively. Although the hadronization effects are apparent for cone jets with \(R=0.4\), the resulting leading jet in most cases is in a back-to-back topology with the photon. In order to reduce the topological bias due to additional radiation, the boson and jets in both \(\gamma\) and \(Z+\rm{jet}\) events are typically required in our studies to be back-to-back within \(\Delta\phi\) of \(\pm 0.2\).

In principle, one can consider two extreme ways of taking the physics effects into account:

* Select only those events where the \(Z\) or \(\gamma\) is back-to-back to only one jet in the event. Require any other jet to have a small transverse momentum. The jet energy correction factors can then be determined from the requirement \(B_{1}=0\) as a function of energy and pseudorapidity. The strong back-to-back cut and the requirement against other jets in the event will severely cut the statistics in such an analysis.
* The other extreme is to take all jets in the event that pass loose selection cuts and balance the sum of their momenta to the \(Z\) or \(\gamma\) momentum. The \(p_{\rm T}\) balance can then be defined as \[B_{\Sigma}=\frac{|\sum_{\rm jets}\vec{p}_{\rm T}|}{p_{\rm T,\gamma/Z}}-1\,\] (2) This approach should be less sensitive to issues related to physics modeling. However, it is more difficult in this case to relate directly the measured balance to the energy scales of specific jets.

Any kinematic selection cut will affect the global \(p_{\rm T}\) balance between the boson and the hadronic system. This is illustrated in Fig. 3. The central figure in the upper row shows the momentum balance \(B_{\Sigma}\) obtained by summing all particle level jets with \(p_{\rm T}>1\) GeV for events with \(p_{\rm T,\,Z}\sim 50\) GeV. The actual balance fluctuates around a mean value close to zero. The right plot shows the corresponding distribution for reconstructed (H1) jets which is broader due to the detector resolution effects.

Figure 2: \(\Delta\phi\) between the photon and the jet for a) cone algorithm with \(R=0.4\), and b) \(k_{\rm T}\) algorithm with \(D=1\).

The left plot shows the \(p_{\rm T}\) balance obtained by fitting a Gaussian to the \(p_{\rm T}\) balance distribution in the various \(p_{\rm T,\,Z}\) bins3. The fitted mean shows a small negative bias (of the order of 1-3%) which decreases with increasing \(p_{\rm T,\,Z}\). Adding the \(p_{\rm T}\) of neutrinos and muons to that of the jets reduces the bias by about 1%, so this cannot be the origin of this systematic effect, which is further discussed later on.

Footnote 3: Throughout this note we use the mean value of a Gaussian distribution fitted within a limited sigma range (typically \(\pm 1\sigma\)) to characterize the \(p_{\rm T}\) balance. We refer to it also as the most probable value.

The effect of selection cuts is studied further, as shown in the middle row of Fig. 3, which presents the \(p_{\rm T}\) balance for particle jets with \(p_{\rm T}>10\) GeV. In addition, the leading jet is required to be back-to-back with the \(Z\) within \(|\Delta\phi|=(\pi\pm 0.2)\). The bias increases and the spread deteriorates after increasing the \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold for jets. The effects are still strong even though the \(\Delta\phi\) cut is imposed. They become less significant as \(p_{\rm T,\,Z}\) increases. The main effect is due to fluctuations of the fragmentation combined with out-of-cone losses and with jet splitting. In addition, residual ISR/FSR contributes significantly to the spread. The underlying event may also contribute particles to the clustered jet. Studies performed with \(\gamma+{\rm jet}\) events [14, 15] indicate that the underlying event contributes \(\sim 20\)

Figure 3: Left in all rows: the mean value of the fitted \(p_{\rm T}\) balance \(B_{\Sigma}\) as a function of \(p_{\rm T,\,Z}\) in \(Z+{\rm jet}\) events. Particle level jets (squares) and jets reconstructed from detector signals (circles) are shown. Middle in all rows: \(B_{\Sigma}\) distribution for \(p_{\rm T,\,Z}\sim 50\) GeV for truth jets. Right in all rows: \(B_{\Sigma}\) distribution for \(p_{\rm T,\,Z}\sim 50\) GeV for reconstructed jets. Upper row: all jets with \(p_{\rm T}>1\) GeV are taken into account.

transverse energy \(E_{T}\) at truth particle level in each \((\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi)\) region of \((0.1\times 0.1)\) which corresponds to one calorimeter tower. This results in \(\sim 1\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) contribution per cone jet with \(R=0.4\) and \(\sim 3\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) per cone jet with \(R=0.7\). The lower row of Fig. 3 shows the same distributions after an additional requirement to have no further jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>10\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) in the event. The spread of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance distributions is reduced. The negative bias is also reduced but remains significant, especially at low \(p_{\mathrm{T},Z}\) values.

Furthermore, these effects strongly depend on the chosen jet algorithm. In Fig. 4 the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance for the leading jet relative to the photon is depicted as a function of photon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for cone jets with \(R=0.4\), \(R=0.7\) and for \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets with \(D=1\). The jets are reconstructed at the truth particle level and at the parton level after parton showering in herwig\(\gamma\)+jet events and after applying the \(\Delta\phi\) cut. The \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets on parton level reveal an essentially perfect balance, as expected from theory. Cone jets are subject to out-of-cone losses due to parton showering. The relative losses increase with decreasing \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), and are bigger for cone jets with smaller radii. They are much larger for particle level cone jets due to the lateral spread of the fragmentation. On the contrary, the \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) algorithm tends to include particles originating from other partons, which leads to a significant positive bias at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

A further important issue in the use of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance is the quantity used as a reference to define the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges. This is illustrated in Fig. 5 in which \(\gamma+\mathrm{jet}\) events are used which were generated with a minimum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of 30\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) for the hard scattering process. The scatter plot shows the photon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) versus the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the parton as produced in the hard interaction. The events are distributed around the diagonal as a result of ISR. The cut at the generator stage is visible. If we choose \(p_{\mathrm{T},\gamma}\) bins to study \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance distributions (e.g. the set of events with 30\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}<p_{\mathrm{T},\gamma}<40\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) contained between the two horizontal dashed lines), we will observe a bias towards lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance values, since in this case we populate the distribution with significantly more events from the left side of the diagonal than from the right side. The events on the left side are generated on average in interactions with smaller center-of-mass energy, hence with higher cross-section. The cross-section decreases quickly with energy and the negative bias of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance is significant4). One should note also that the bias is proportional to the spread around

Figure 4: Mean value of the fitted \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance (\(B_{1}+1\)) as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T},\gamma}\) in \(\gamma+\mathrm{jet}\) herwig events for various jet algorithms. The points correspond to particle level and parton level jets.

the diagonal. Hence it decreases with \(p_{\rm T}\). It also decreases if one requires the parton and the \(\gamma\) to be back-to-back in azimuth within some \(\Delta\phi\) limit, since the ISR spread is then reduced [14]. If we were able to select events according to \((p_{\rm T,\,\gamma}+p_{\rm T,\,parton})/2\) (with lines perpendicular to the diagonal), then the symmetry would be restored.

This can be seen in Fig. 6. The \(p_{\rm T}\) balance \(B_{1}\) for events with \(101<p_{\rm T}<152\)\({\rm Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) is shown in the left panel of the figure. The solid line shows the balance when the \(p_{\rm T}\) is taken as the average \(p_{\rm T}\) of the photon and the jet5) and the triangles when it is taken as the photon \(p_{\rm T}\). The difference in the shape is clearly visible with a more pronounced low tail for the \(p_{\rm T,\,\gamma}\) reference, because the cross-section favors the case when ISR has reduced the leading jet \(p_{\rm T}\), as discussed above. The circles show the balance with the photon \(p_{\rm T}\) reference when the photon and the jet are required to be back-to-back within 0.2 to reduce

measured at the origin. The tight selection maintains a good efficiency of \(>60\%\) above 100 while it is significantly reduced at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). These tight selection cuts have not been optimized. Their purpose in this note is to show that additional purity can be obtained, without too much loss of efficiency, at least for the higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range. The photon energy calibration, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}(\mathrm{reconstructed})/p_{\mathrm{T}}(\mathrm{truth})\), has been checked and is between 0.995 and 1 over most of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range. No photons impinging in the calorimeter crack regions with \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\) are used.

The average response of jets over the various calorimeter regions was checked and a residual miscalibration of about 1% was found for all \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) values. Jets close to the crack regions are not well calibrated, therefore jets with \(1.3<|\eta|<1.8\) are excluded from further analysis. Eventually we will rely on dijet balance to correct for such \(\eta\)-dependent effects in the calibration (see Section 5).

Figure 7 shows the measured \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance. The photon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is used as the reference and the standard back-to-back \(\Delta\phi\) cut is applied. Table 2 shows the fitted mean, the statistical uncertainty and the integrated luminosity for each \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) interval for the tight photon selection. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance above 80 is flattening at the level of -0.02. At low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) the balance with the tight photon selection is a few percent below the balance measured with the default cuts. The photon reconstruction efficiency is low, and the stringent isolation cuts likely bias the sample composition rejecting events with strong ISR or underlying event. The match between the leading reconstructed jet and the leading truth jet is better than 98.5% for jets above 70; it degrades to 85% for jets above 17. The reconstruction level \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance is one percent below the truth level balance. This is the result of the residual miscalibration of the jets in the particular release of the ATLAS event reconstruction software, as checked by comparing the reconstructed jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) with the truth particle level jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

The pythia QCD jet samples described in Table 1 were used to estimate the influence of the dijet background. The jet rejection factors for the standard photon selection and the tight photon selection were studied as a function of jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). With the default photon selection criteria, the probability of identifying a jet as the leading photon is of the order of \(10^{-3}\) and has some \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) dependence. The resulting signal to background ratio is estimated to be of the order of 1 above 100 and degrades to about 0.1 for lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The tight photon selection improves the signal to background reduced by a factor of three or more.

Figure 8 left shows the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance distribution for QCD background events passing the default photon selection in the interval \(140<p_{\mathrm{T},\,\gamma}<280\). The back-to-back \(\Delta\phi\) cut has been applied. The fitted most probable value of the distribution with the default photon selection and the \(\Delta\phi\) cut is 0.13. Applying the tight selection reduces the number of background events, but a few events still remain in the tail. It

will thus be desirable to maintain a good signal to background ratio to avoid a bias that would be difficult to control. For the tight photon selection, the mean of the Gaussian fit to the signal shown in Fig. 8 (right) for the interval \(140<p_{\mathrm{T},\gamma}<280\GeV\) changes by less than 1% when the background is added in.

Thus, the background studies have shown that above \(\sim 80\GeV\), the signal to background ratio is good enough to avoid bias. A more detailed and higher statistics study of the background rejection at lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) should be carried out, to understand if the range of high precision could be extended to lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

Table 2 shows that a good statistical precision is obtained for a relatively small integrated luminosity. For example, \(100\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) is sufficient to reach a precision of \(1-2\%\) for jets in the range \(300<E_{\mathrm{T}}<500\GeV\). We expect that the threshold of the un-prescaled photon trigger will be \(60\GeV\) for early running. Hence above that value the full statistics should be recorded while prescale factors will have to be applied for lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

### Analysis of \(Z+\mathrm{jet}\) events

A sample of inclusive \(Z\) boson events corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \(500\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) has been produced using alpgen. The MLM matching cut is imposed at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<6\), and the factorization scale is set at \(m_{\mathrm{Z}}^{2}+p_{\mathrm{T},Z}^{2}\) where \(m_{\mathrm{Z}}\) is the \(Z\) boson mass. The invariant mass is required to lie between 40 and 200. A generator-level filter requires one truth cone jet with \(R=0.4\), with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<5.0\) and two electrons/muons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>10\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.7\) in the event.

Another sample of inclusive \(Z\) events corresponding to 120\(\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\), as well as the relevant background samples have been generated using pythia. The signal has been generated via the Drell-Yan process (\(\mathrm{ISUB}=1\)) [5]. As for \(\gamma+\mathrm{jet}\) events, the \(qg\) Compton process dominates over the whole \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range. The Drell-Yan process contributes due to higher order QCD radiation which may reproduce the leading jet.

The \(Z\to ee\) and \(W\to e\nu\) events are produced with a generator-level filter requiring one truth electron with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>10\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.7\). The \(Z\to\tau\tau\) events are generated with a filter requiring two electrons/muons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>5\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.8\). For \(Z\to\tau\tau\) and \(Z\to ee\) the dilepton mass is required to be larger than 60. For more details on the data samples see Ref. [16].

The fully simulated events are required to pass the isolated single-electron trigger with a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold of 25 or the isolated di-electron trigger with the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold of 15 at trigger level 1 and 2. Electrons are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\GeV\), \(|\eta|<2.5\) and to be outside the calorimeter cracks defined as \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\). Jets are reconstructed with the cone tower algorithm with \(R=0.7\). They are required to have a distance of \(\Delta R>0.4\) from a reconstructed electron and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\GeV\).

The \(Z\) bosons are selected by requiring two reconstructed electrons with invariant mass in the range \(m_{\mathrm{Z}}\pm 20\GeV\). If more than two electrons are reconstructed, the pair with the invariant mass closest to \(m_{\mathrm{Z}}\) is chosen. The combined distribution of the invariant mass for the signal and background events is shown in the left panel of Fig. 9 for alpgen\(Z+\mathrm{jet}\) events where jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>40\GeV\) are reconstructed using the cone tower algorithm with \(R=0.7\). The main backgrounds are from QCD multijets and from top production, while \(Z\to\tau\tau\) and \(W\to e\nu\) events are an order of magnitude smaller. The background level is reasonably low. Requiring the jet and the \(Z\) to be back-to-back in azimuth within 0.2 reduces the background to a negligible level.

The right panel of Fig. 9 shows the measured balance for cone jets with \(R=0.7\) as predicted by alpgen for 500\(\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\). The precision with which the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance can be measured experimentally depends

Figure 9: Left: Distribution of the dielectron mass for \(Z\to ee+\geq 1\)jet events and the relevant background in a simulated event sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 200\(\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) with cone jets with \(R=0.7\). Right: The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance for an integrated luminosity of 500\(\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) of cone jets with \(R=0.7\) in events generated with alpgen in 5 bins of \(p_{\mathrm{T},Z}\).

on the efficiency for reconstructing the \(Z\) in its electron or muon decay channels, on the trigger efficiency and on the experimental width of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance distribution. Table 3 shows the fitted most probable value of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance and the statistical precision for an integrated luminosity of \(500\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) obtained with the \(Z\to ee\) sample. Below \(200\GeV\), the precision is of the order of \(0.8\%\), while above \(200\GeV\), it gets worse. The \(Z\to\mu\mu\) decay mode can also be used. A similar efficiency and background level can be achieved as shown in [16] doubling the available statistics. A statistical precision of \(1\%\) can be achieved below \(200\GeV\) with an integrated luminosity of \(100\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\), while above the precision is at the level of \(2\%\). This assumes also that the complete \(\eta\) range can be used for the measurement, relying on techniques like dijet balancing to ensure uniformity across \(\eta\) to the desired precision.

The measurement is also affected by systematic uncertainties. The balance is sensitive to the correct modeling of higher order radiation. Comparing the predictions from different Monte Carlo simulation programs gives an indication of the size of such effects. This is illustrated in Fig. 10, in which alpgen and pythia samples of \(Z+\mathrm{jet}\) events corresponding to \(120\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) and \(500\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) (alpgen only) are compared after applying the \(\Delta\phi\) cut, for cone jets with \(R=0.7\). pythia predicts a more negative average \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) than alpgen. This effect is related to broader distributions and larger tails in the balance distributions resulting from low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) activity in pythia induced by higher order radiation. The differences between the two generators can be tested with \(\sim 100\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) of data for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<100\GeV\).

### The missing \(E_{t}\) projection method

The missing \(\vec{E}_{\mathrm{T}}\) projection method is an alternative approach to test the jet energy scale and has been used successfully by the D0 experiment to determine the response of their calorimeter to hadronic jets [17]. It is explained here for the example of \(\gamma+\mathrm{jet}\) events, but it can also be used for \(Z+\mathrm{jet}\) events. Details about the study presented in this section can be found in Ref. [15].

At leading order, momentum conservation between the photon and the jet gives

\[\vec{E}_{\mathrm{T},\gamma}+\vec{p}_{\mathrm{T},\mathrm{parton}}=0. \tag{3}\]

Neglecting parton showering and hadronization effects, this can be rewritten at particle level as

\[\vec{E}_{\mathrm{T},\gamma}+\vec{E}_{\mathrm{T},\mathrm{jet}}\approx 0\, \tag{4}\]

where momentum has been replaced by energy, which is a good approximation for light quark jets.

The systematic effects of parton showering and hadronization, including initial state radiation (ISR) and final state radiation (FSR), can be reduced by requiring that the leading jet and the photon are back-to-back within \(0.2\) in azimuth in a similar way to what was shown in Fig. 2.

At the calorimeter level, the balance equation is modified to

\[e\vec{E}_{\mathrm{T},\gamma}+j(E_{\mathrm{jet}})\vec{E}_{\mathrm{T},\mathrm{ jet}}=-\vec{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}. \tag{5}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) interval & cone \(0.7\) jet balance & error & cone \(0.4\) jet balance & error \\ \hline \(30<p_{\mathrm{T}}<40\GeV\) & \(-0.032\) & \(0.008\) & \(-0.150\) & \(0.007\) \\ \(40<p_{\mathrm{T}}<60\GeV\) & \(-0.059\) & \(0.007\) & \(-0.162\) & \(0.008\) \\ \(60<p_{\mathrm{T}}<100\GeV\) & \(-0.032\) & \(0.006\) & \(-0.113\) & \(0.007\) \\ \(100<p_{\mathrm{T}}<200\GeV\) & \(-0.027\) & \(0.007\) & \(-0.081\) & \(0.008\) \\ \(200<p_{\mathrm{T}}<400\GeV\) & \(-0.026\) & \(0.014\) & \(-0.060\) & \(0.016\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

where \(e\), \(j\) are the electromagnetic and hadronic responses, \(E_{\rm calo}\)/\(E_{\rm particle}\), of the calorimeters, respectively. It is implicit in Eq. 5 that energy deposited in the calorimeters by the underlying event and pileup is symmetric in \(\phi\). These assumptions have been tested and their effect is small. Anticipating that the electromagnetic scale will be well calibrated, for example by using the electrons from the decay of a Z boson, we can assume that \(e\approx 1\). The quantities can then be projected in the direction of the photon, yielding

\[E_{\rm T,\,\gamma}+j(E_{\rm jet})\vec{E}_{\rm T,jet}\cdot\hat{n}_{\gamma}=- \hat{n}_{\gamma}\cdot\vec{E}_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\, \tag{6}\]

where \(\hat{n}_{\gamma}\) is the unit vector in the direction of the photon. Using the relation

\[\vec{E}_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}=-\vec{E}_{\rm T,\,\gamma}-\sum{}^{\prime}\vec{E}_{ \rm T}\, \tag{7}\]

where \(\sum^{\prime}\) indicates a sum over all activity in the calorimeter other than the \(\gamma\), the response can be further simplified as

\[j=\frac{\sum^{\prime}\vec{E}_{\rm T}\cdot\hat{n}_{\gamma}}{\vec{E}_{\rm T,jet} \cdot\hat{n}_{\gamma}}=\frac{\sum^{\prime}\vec{E}_{\rm T}\cdot\hat{n}_{\gamma }}{E_{\rm T,\,\gamma}}, \tag{8}\]

where Eq. 4 was used in the last step. In this form it is clear that this method of measuring the response is independent of the underlying event, since the hadronic activity outside the \(\gamma+{\rm jet}\) system is approximately \(\phi\)-symmetric and its contribution to the sum cancels out. It is also (mostly) independent of the jet algorithm.

However, the jet response depends on the jet energy because the relative fraction of EM energy in the calorimeter level jet increases with increasing energy, hence a correction for non-compensation must be applied. Thus, the response has to be measured as a function of the jet energy. If we bin the response as a function of the measured jet energy (\(E_{\rm jet}\)), it would be biased towards lower \(E_{\rm T,\,\gamma}\) due to the bin migration described in Section 4.2. Instead, the jet energy is taken as \(E^{\prime}=E_{\rm T,\,\gamma}\cdot\cosh(\eta_{\rm jet})\), which uses the much better measured energy of the photon and projects it in the jet direction; this procedure is based on the

Figure 10: The \(p_{\rm T}\) balance for an integrated luminosity of 120pb\({}^{-1}\) and 500pb\({}^{-1}\) in events generated with alpgen (dots and triangles, respectively) and for 120pb\({}^{-1}\) in events generated with pythia (squares) in bins of \(p_{\rm T,Z}\) for cone jets with \(R=0.7\).

momentum balance of Eq. 4. The EM scale jet energy distribution is fitted with a Gaussian in each bin of reference energy \(E^{\prime}\), and the jet energy scale is then calculated. The correspondence between \(E^{\prime}\) and the measured jet energy is also determined. The resulting jet energy scale can then be plotted as a function of \(E_{\rm jet}\).

The response function is then plotted for each algorithm as a function of the corresponding mean jet energy and parameterized by

\[j(E)=b_{0}+b_{1}\ln\frac{E}{E_{\rm scale}}+b_{2}\ln^{2}\frac{E}{E_{\rm scale}} \tag{9}\]

with \(E_{\rm scale}\) set to 200 GeV and the \(b\) parameters fitted, as shown in Fig. 11.

The fit function is used to correct the jet energy at the EM scale \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm meas}\). The corrected energy \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm calib}=E_{\rm T}^{\rm meas}/j(E)\) is then compared to the truth information \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm MC}\) in the Monte Carlo simulation. Figure 12 is a plot of the ratio \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm MC}/E_{\rm T}^{\rm calib}\) as a function of jet energy, which shows a linear response within \(\approx 2\%\) over the range \(50-900\) GeV.

This procedure accounts for the fact that the ATLAS calorimeters are non-compensating and that the electromagnetic content of a hadronic shower is energy dependent. Further adjustments, such as out-of-cone corrections, must be made to obtain the final jet energy scale. It is only at this point that jet algorithm dependent corrections are made and is therefore a useful method as a cross-check of our understanding of the energy scale with different sensitivity to systematic effects.

### Conclusions of the studies of \(\gamma\)/\(Z\) + jet events

The use of the in-situ \(\gamma\)/\(Z\) + jet processes allows us to propagate the knowledge of the electromagnetic scale characteristic of the \(\gamma\) or the \(Z\to\ell\ell\) decay to the hadronic recoil system. Typically the leading jet is required to be back-to-back in azimuth with the \(\gamma\) or the \(Z\) boson, and the \(p_{\rm T}\) balance between them is used to connect the two scales.

The balance is affected by various physics effects which systematically limit the precision of the in-situ validation procedure. These effects can be as large as \(5-10\%\) at 20 GeV and tend to decrease to the percent level at about 100 GeV.

Figure 11: The energy dependence of the jet response for cone jets with \(R=0.4\). The solid line corresponds to the fit using Eq. 9.

The \(\gamma+\mathrm{jet}\) process has the advantage of higher statistics compared to \(Z+\mathrm{jet}\). However, at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) it may be seriously affected by background from QCD jets. Hence it may turn out to be most useful above \(\sim\)\(50-100\) GeV where the signal to background ratio is more favorable and where an inclusive single photon trigger is available. A statistical precision better than a percent is achieved already with \(10\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) at \(100\) GeV, and in the range \(300-500\) GeV the percent level is reached with about \(100\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\). The \(Z+\mathrm{jet}\) process allows us to measure the absolute energy scale in the low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range with a statistical precision of \(1\%\) with \(\sim 300\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) of data. It provides also the highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) reach with percent level precision in the range \(300-500\) GeV with \(\sim 200\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\). Above \(\sim 500\) GeV, other methods will be used as discussed further on.

## 5 In-situ studies using QCD jet events

### Calorimeter intercalibration in QCD dijet samples

The calorimeter response \(p_{\mathrm{T}}(\mathrm{reconstructed})/p_{\mathrm{T}}(\mathrm{truth})\) for jets at the EM scale reveals significant variations with pseudorapidity \(\eta\), as shown in Fig. 13. The dips correspond to known cracks and dead material regions. The response may also be non-uniform in azimuth \(\phi\) for the same \(\eta\) due to the variations in the basic calorimeter response and due to the non-uniform distribution of the dead material. The response in \(\phi\) and \(\eta\) should become flat at the hadronic scale. This has to be checked in-situ with high precision, and if necessary, an intercalibration of different regions of the calorimeter has to be performed. For this study we use pythia QCD jet events, generated in intervals of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the hard scattered partons, as described in Section 4.3.

#### 5.1.1 Intercalibration in azimuth

The intercalibration in \(\phi\) can be checked using the high rates of QCD jet events. As the scattering cross section is constant in \(\phi\), the jet rates above a fixed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold have to be nearly equal in different \(\phi\) sectors, as shown in Fig. 14 (left) for 64 \(\phi\) sectors in the \(\eta\) range \(|\eta|<0.1\) which corresponds to the segmentation of the ATLAS hadronic calorimeter in one calorimeter wheel. Strongly deviating rates in

Figure 12: The ratios \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{MC}}/E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{calib}}\) (triangles) and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{MC}}/E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{meas}}\) (squares) for jets reconstructed using the cone algorithm with \(R=0.4\). See the text for an explanation of the symbols.

particular sectors would point to dead calorimeter cells, losses in dead material, or noise.

For a perfectly calibrated calorimeter the spread of rates around the mean rate value \(N\) should be \(\sqrt{N}\) following the Poissonian distribution. Thus, collecting on average e.g. \(\sim\)1000 events per sector, one would expect the spread of \(\sim\)30 events, i.e. 3% of the average rate. A significantly larger spread would point to a relative miscalibration of different sectors. The spread can be obtained by filling a histogram with the rates and fitting it with a gaussian. Due to the strongly falling jet \(p_{\rm T}\) distribution the rates are extremely sensitive to the jet energy scale: a \(1.5-2\%\) shift in the energy scale would result in \(\sim\)\(6-9\%\) change of the rate, which is a \(2-3\sigma\) effect for the above example with 1000 events per sector. Thus, the statistics of 1000 events per sector should allow us to control the jet energy scale to within \(1.5-2\%\). The luminosity necessary to collect such statistics in 64 \(\phi\) sectors within the \(\eta\) interval \(|\eta|<0.1\) is shown for different \(p_{\rm T}\) thresholds in Fig. 14 (right). A study of the systematics for this method is on the way.

The trigger menu for the initial running period at the luminosity of \(10^{31}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\) is currently under development, and the effect of trigger prescaling has not yet been taken into account in this plot. The highest \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold for the inclusive jet trigger is expected to be at \(100-150\,\mathrm{GeV}\), above which no prescaling will be applied. The prescale factors will steeply rise for lower thresholds, such that the recorded event rate should be roughly flat in \(p_{\rm T}\). Scaling the shown luminosity values for the lowest two \(p_{\rm T}\) bins down with the currently foreseen prescale factors shows that the rate of recorded events will be still sufficient to reach the statistical precision of \(1.5-2\%\) with \(\stackrel{{<}}{{\sim}}10\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) of data.

However, the rates may be affected by the calibration of the level 1 calorimeter trigger. To avoid a bias, the \(p_{\rm T}\) thresholds chosen for this analysis should be significantly higher than the respective trigger thresholds. This will lead to a loss of statistics, and thus a higher integrated luminosity will be necessary for the same statistical precision.

#### 5.1.2 Intercalibration in pseudorapidity

The intercalibration in \(\eta\) can be done based on the \(p_{\rm T}\) balance in QCD dijet events. The roughly three orders of magnitude higher cross section of dijet events, as compared to \(Z/\gamma+\,\)jet events, allows an intercalibration of the calorimeter with higher granularity, higher precision and for higher energy ranges than can be achieved in \(Z/\gamma+\,\)jet events for the same integrated luminosity. Applying the calibration based on the \(p_{\rm T}\) balance, one corrects for the relative difference in calorimeter response for jets, the noise and pile-up in different regions of pseudorapidity \(\eta\). The goal is to achieve a flat response in \(\eta\) and to extend the previous calibrations for \(|\eta|<2.5\) to higher pseudorapidities.

The method is straightforward: one calorimeter region in pseudorapidity \(\eta\) is chosen as the reference region and jets in other \(\eta\) regions are calibrated relative to jets in this region. Normally, one calorimeter \(\eta\) wheel in the central range, far from the crack regions, will be chosen as the reference region. Other considerations are the existence of dead or noisy cells in a particular part of the calorimeter, the uniformity of the response in \(\phi\) within one wheel etc. The width of the region will also depend on the available statistics.

We choose to characterize the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-balance in dijet events by the asymmetry \(A\) given by

\[A=\frac{p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{probe}}-p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{ref}}}{(p_{ \mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{probe}}+p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{ref}})/2}\, \tag{10}\]

where \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{ref}}\) is the transverse momentum of the jet in the reference region, and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{probe}}\) is that of the jet in the region to be calibrated. Using this form, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance is symmetric, as shown in Fig. 15 (left) for reconstructed cone jets with \(R=0.7\). It thus provides better properties than the simple definition \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{probe}}/p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{ref}}\) which is intrinsically asymmetric.

To limit ISR/FSR and thereby reduce the width of the asymmetry distribution, a cut on the azimuthal angle between the two jets, \(\Delta\phi>3\), is applied. The fitted mean value of the asymmetry as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is displayed in the right panel of Fig. 15 and shows that for this definition there is very little bias both for truth particle jets and for reconstructed jets at the hadronic scale.

Further cuts can be applied to obtain a cleaner dijet sample and thus reduce further the width of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance distributions. For example, the total number of reconstructed jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>10\) can be limited to \(N_{\mathrm{jet}}<4\) or even more strongly to \(N_{\mathrm{jet}}=2\). However, these additional cuts reduce the statistics of the sample, as demonstrated in Fig. 16, which shows the integrated luminosity required to reach a statistical precision of 0.5% of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance fit mean value in the probe range \(0.7<\eta<0.8\), where \(0<|\eta|<0.7\) is taken as the reference region. The luminosity values are shown for different sets of cuts. For the case of applying only the back-to-back cut on the angle between the two leading jets, 0.5% precision can be reached in this \(\eta\) region with \(10\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) of data for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{<}}{{\sim}}$}\,300\) GeV, and with \(100\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{<}}{{\sim}}$}\,500\) GeV.

Similar plots were produced for the other \(\eta\) regions, which show that an order of magnitude more luminosity is necessary for \(|\eta|>2.5\), compared to the central region. On the other hand, the size of the

Figure 14: Left: The jet rate as a function of \(\phi\) for jets with the transverse momentum above a certain threshold. Right: Integrated luminosity required to collect 1000 events with jets above the given \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds in each of the 64 \(\phi\) sectors in the region \(|\eta|<0.1\).

reference region can be increased sequentially, i.e. as soon as one \(\eta\) has been checked or recalibrated, it can be added to the reference region to study the next \(\eta\) range.

As in the luminosity estimation for the \(\phi\) intercalibration in Section 5.1.1, the trigger prescaling has not yet been taken into account in Fig. 16. As in Sect. 5.1.1, scaling the shown luminosity values for the lowest two \(p_{\rm T}\) bins down with the currently foreseen prescale factors shows that the rate of recorded events will be sufficient to reach 0.5% precision with \(\stackrel{{<}}{{\sim}}10\) pb\({}^{-1}\) of data.

The calibration method is further tested in the full \(\eta\) region for different \(p_{\rm T}\) ranges. For each \(\eta\) region \(i\) in each \(p_{\rm T}\) range \(j\), the asymmetry \(A\) defined in Eq. 10 is fitted and the mean value \(A_{ij}\) is used to calculate a correction factor \(c_{ij}\) via

\[c_{ij}=\frac{2-A_{ij}}{2+A_{ij}}. \tag{11}\]

In the case of an imperfect original calibration, factors deviating from 1 are obtained.

Each jet \(p_{\rm T}\) can

then be multiplied by the appropriate factor to restore the balance of fully simulated jets. More details of this study can be found in Ref. [18].

### High \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jet calibration

The calibration of the jet energy scale for high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets (with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\stackrel{{>}}{{\sim}}500\) GeV) is a challenge at hadron collider experiments. In this energy range, methods developed for lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets, normally using well defined objects as reference, start to fail. This difficulty will be further increased at the early stage of data taking, where both our understanding of the detectors and the statistics of such high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets are usually limited. Our goal is to develop a calibration technique for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>500\) GeV based on data collected with an integrated luminosity of 0.1-1 fb\({}^{-1}\). The basic idea is to determine the energy scale of high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets from lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets, for which the energy scale will be obtained by the techniques described earlier in this note. Two calibration techniques are discussed in the following sections: 1) the correlation between different \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets in momentum balance in the transverse plane, and 2) the angle between particles in the jets.

#### 5.2.1 Multijet balance method

This method is based on selecting events with multiple (\(>2\)) jets and calibrating the energy scale of the highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jet by requiring a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance between the leading jet and the system of remaining lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets. The absolute jet energy scale of the non-leading jets, which is expected to be obtained from photon+jets, \(Z\)+jets and/or \(W\)\(\rightarrow\) jet jet studies, is thus propagated to the JES of the higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets using \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance methods. The large QCD jet cross-section allows for a very high reach in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). This method has been studied with samples generated with both alpgen and pythia using the fast and full detector simulation. Two different analysis techniques were applied as described in the following.

#### alpgen study

For this study QCD multijet samples with 4, 5 and 6 partons were generated using alpgen interfaced with jimmy. Four data samples were formed by requiring the leading parton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) to be larger than 400, 600, 800, or 1000 GeV, while the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the next-to-leading parton was required to be smaller than 200, 300, 400, or 500 GeV, respectively. The total number of partons (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}>40\) GeV) can be 4, 5 and 6 in each of the above samples. All the partons are required to be in the range \(|\eta|<3\). These samples, referred to as PT400, PT600, PT800, and PT1000 hereafter, were processed through the full detector simulation.

At least four cone jets with \(R=0.7\) with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>40\) GeV must be reconstructed in each event. The leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) in the samples PT400, 600, 800, and 1000 must be in the interval \(400<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet1}}<460\) GeV, \(600<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet1}}<700\) GeV, \(800<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet1}}<920\) GeV, and \(1000<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet1}}<1140\) GeV, respectively, while the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the next-to-leading jet must correspondingly respect the bound \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet2}}<190\) GeV, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet2}}<280\) GeV, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet2}}<370\) GeV, and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet2}}<470\) GeV. In addition the leading jet and the vector sum of the remaining lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>40\) GeV (called remnant jets) are required to be back-to-back in azimuth within \(\pm 20^{\circ}\). After all the cuts, about 3200, 310, 40, and 11 events remain in the PT400, 600, 800, and 1000 samples, respectively, for an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\).

The distribution of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance, defined as

\[B^{\prime}_{\Sigma}=\frac{p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet1}}}{\mathrm{non-leading~ {}jets}\mid\sum p_{\mathrm{T}}\mid}\, \tag{12}\]

is plotted for each sample and fitted by a Gaussian. The mean values of the Gaussian fits with their uncertainties for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) are shown in Fig. 17 as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet1}}\). The figure indicates that \(B^{\prime}_{\Sigma}\) could be determined with a statistical accuracy of 2% or better for high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets with \(400<p_{\mathrm{T}}<1100\GeV\) and that it shows a constant offset of 2-3% over the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jel}}\) range, as also observed in the \(\mathrm{pythia}\) study.

Various potential sources of systematic effect have been studied. Low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets will not contribute to remnant jet system because of the 40 \(\Pp_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold applied to the jets. If the threshold is varied by \(\pm 20\GeV\), \(B^{\prime}_{\Sigma}\) varies by \(\pm 1\%\) at most. The effect is smaller, for the same range of thresholds, than in the \(\mathrm{pythia}\) analysis because of the back-to-back requirement imposed on the system. A sizable fraction of the soft radiation is still missed is the event. This is the main cause of the positive \(B^{\prime}_{\Sigma}\) offset. It could be reduced by requiring the overall event \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) to be balanced, e.g. by requiring that \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}<40\GeV\). In that case, \(B^{\prime}_{\Sigma}\) decreases by 1-2% and becomes close to 1. However, an \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) cut should be used with caution as fake \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) could cause biases. The effect of the underlying event on \(B^{\prime}_{\Sigma}\) has also been evaluated by subtracting the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) measured in a cone (\(R=0.7\)) placed randomly in a region of azimuth within \(60^{\circ}<\Delta\phi<120^{\circ}\) from the leading jet and not overlapping with any of the remnant jets. After subtraction, \(B^{\prime}_{\Sigma}\) increases by 1-2%.

The precision on the JES for high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets is affected by the JES uncertainty of the remnant jets. If we assume the uncertainty to be \(\pm 7\%\) for low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets with \(|\eta|<3.2\), which is the current linearity performance of the H1 weight calibration method used in this analysis [1], vary the scale of the remnant jets by \(\pm 7\%\), and apply again all the event selection, \(B^{\prime}_{\Sigma}\) changes by \(\pm 7\%\) independently of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jel}}\). This provides an estimate of the JES uncertainty for high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets. The uncertainty on \(B^{\prime}_{\Sigma}\) is increased since more events fail the next-to-leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cut that is included in the overall JES uncertainty.

Adding the statistical and above systematic uncertainties in quadrature, the JES uncertainty obtained from multijet balance method is estimated to be about 8% in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range of \(400<p_{\mathrm{T}}<1100\GeV\) and is totally dominated by the absolute JES uncertainty for lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) remnant jets. If the absolute JES uncertainty is not included in the systematics, the relative JES uncertainty is 3%.

## 0.6 \(\mathrm{pythia}\) study

In this study, \(\mathrm{pythia}\) samples with full and fast detector simulation were used. The fully simulated sample was generated with kinematic cuts of \(280<p_{\mathrm{T}}<560\GeV\) for the hard scattering process. It corresponds to an integrated luminosity of about \(25\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\). Cone jets with \(R=0.7\) were reconstructed based on calorimeter towers, topoclusters and on Monte Carlo truth particles.

The fast simulation package ATLFAST was used for a high statistics study. A cut on the hard scattered parton at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>280\GeV\) was applied. The sample represents an integrated luminosity of about

Figure 17: Energy scale (left) and energy scale uncertainty (right) of high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets relative to lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) remnant jets as a function of jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), obtained by multijet balance method at an integrated luminosity of \(1\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). The error bars shown are statistical only.

\(0.8\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). Cone jets with \(R=0.4\) were used for this study.

Events are selected with a minimum of three reconstructed jets, the leading jet being above a fixed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold, up to which the JES is assumed to be calibrated. All non-leading jets are required to be below that value. A further event selection cut is \(|\eta|<2\) for the leading jet. Generally non-leading jets have been reconstructed up to \(|\eta|<5\) and down to \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>10\). For specific studies of their systematic influences all these cuts have been varied.

Figure 18 presents results of the method for the sample using full detector simulation. The event selection cut on non-leading jets is \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<300\). On the left, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance \(B^{\prime}_{\Sigma}\) is shown for leading jets with \(370<p_{\mathrm{T}}<380\), together with a Gaussian fit. While non-Gaussian tails are visible, which could be partly reduced by a stricter event selection, they do not influence the fit and it was thus decided to use the maximum statistics.

To reduce the bias of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance due to migration effects, the division of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region into bins is done based on the average \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the sum of the non-leading jets and the leading jet of each event. This reduces the bias to about 1% at truth level. This is similar to what is studied in the \(Z/\gamma+\mathrm{jet}\) analyses (Section 4.2), where the average \((p_{\mathrm{T},\,\gamma/\mathrm{Z}}+p_{\mathrm{T},\mathrm{jet}})/2\) is an option for the binning.

On the right of Fig. 18 the JES was studied from 350 to 550. The result is reasonably flat but shows a systematic offset of about 2%, as also observed in the alpgen study. There are various effects contributing to this imbalance, mostly originating from soft radiation affecting the low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets in the hemisphere opposite the leading jet. At truth jet level, changing the minimum jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) from 5 to 10/20/40 introduces a negative bias of 0.2/1/3%, respectively. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold value for real data should be chosen taking the noise, pile-up conditions and jet finding efficiency at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) into account. Out of cone losses also play a role: changing the cone size from 0.7 to 0.4 at truth level, affects the measured balance by \(\sim 1\%\). Furthermore, imperfect calibration of low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets at the level of few percent [1] may be a cause of bias.

In a high statistics study, based on ATLFAST, the non-leading jets were restricted to a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) value below 350 during event selection. Figure 19 shows the result on the left. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance distribution is lower than for cone jets with \(R=0.7\), as discussed above. Truth and ATLFAST jets give closer results in this case, since the latter are truth jets smeared for resolution effects.

The reach in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the method can be further increased by iterating the procedure. Apart from the QCD jet cross-section, the statistics are mainly limited by the cut on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the non-leading jets during event selection, essentially requiring that one parton in the hard scattering lost a significant part of its energy due to gluon radiation. For higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges this cut should be moved to higher values to obtain

Figure 18: Left: the ratio of the absolute value of the vector sum of the non-leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) to the leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bin 370–380 fitted by a Gaussian. Right: this ratio as a function of jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The mean and the error of the mean of the Gaussian fits are shown. The average of the leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and of the total \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the non-leading jets is used for the binning.

sufficient statistics. The procedure is thus, after applying the method once, up to a certain \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), to use the range up to this \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) as reference region for a next iteration. Results using this approach based on the ATLFAST sample are shown in Fig. 19 on the right hand side. For the studied high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region, the multijet statistics predicted by pythia may be an underestimation, as the pythia parton shower model is not perfectly tuned for this \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range.

A crucial feature for this method, as observed in pythia simulations, is that the imbalance value remains essentially constant for one iteration if the tested JES is correct. The balance can differ between the iterations. In general, it is slightly closer to 1 for higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges, as the system of non-leading jets becomes harder and thus less sensitive to low energy effects. To ensure that the JES is correct, we require that the beginning of the test region for a given iteration overlaps with the end of the region verified in the previous iteration, or at the very beginning verified by another method.

A complete understanding of the feature that the balance should remain constant for all \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) within one iteration, is necessary in order to rely on it in data. In this case, in addition to the absolute JES uncertainty of the non-leading jets, the systematic uncertainty of this method is given by deviations of the balance from a constant value as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

To determine this additional systematic uncertainty, the deviations are split into a global slope of a linear fit and into local deviations around this fit. As possible sources of systematic effects, the absolute JES of the remnant system, the choice of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) binning, the lower and upper \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds for the non-leading jets, the effect of the underlying event and of the noise, and the effect of the varying jet multiplicity in the remnant system are studied. To estimate the deviations quantitatively, the absolute JES is varied by 10%; the lower jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold is varied between 10 and 50 GeV; the upper threshold for each iteration is varied by 100 GeV; the effect of the underlying event and of the noise is estimated by adding \(\pm 5\) GeV to each jet in the event; and the analysis is performed separately for events with exactly 4, 5 and 6 jets.

The slope of the fit is compatible with zero within statistical uncertainties for all variations of the sources. The corresponding systematic uncertainties for each source is estimated to be \(\stackrel{{<}}{{\sim}}0.1\)%. The estimation is limited by the available statistics. All local deviations from a linear fit are of the order of the statistical uncertainties. The width of their distribution is found to be less than 0.2% above the statistical expectation for each of the above influences. Adding all uncertainties quadratically results in a very small total systematic uncertainty of 0.5%. Thus, the main contribution to the JES uncertainty is expected to be the accuracy of the calibration in the reference region. The JES can then be calibrated up to \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\stackrel{{>}}{{\sim}}1.5\) TeV, with the specific uncertainties introduced by this method being below 1% and requiring less than 1fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity.

#### 5.2.2 Track angle method

The idea behind this method is that the invariant mass of two particles in a jet is approximately constant (given by the scale of \(\Lambda_{\rm QCD}\)), which leads to a \(p_{\rm T}^{-1}\) behavior of the \(\eta\)-\(\phi\) distance between two particles in a jet \(\Delta R\), where \(p_{\rm T}\) is the transverse momentum of the jet. The dependence of \(\Delta R\) on \(p_{\rm T}^{-1}\) of the jet could provide a means of determining the energy scale of high \(p_{\rm T}\) jets once the JES of lower \(p_{\rm T}\) jets is calibrated with some accuracy using other in-situ techniques. The procedure to determine the JES of high \(p_{\rm T}\) jets is as follows: 1) measure \(\Delta R\) for low \(p_{\rm T}\) jets with the calibrated JES in both data and Monte Carlo samples, 2) calibrate the simulation so that \(\Delta R\) in the simulation matches \(\Delta R\) in data in the low \(p_{\rm T}\) range, then 3) measure the \(\Delta R\) for a sample of given high \(p_{\rm T}\) jets in data, and look for the Monte Carlo jet \(p_{\rm T}\) scale corresponding to the measured \(\Delta R\) value on the curve of \(\Delta R(p_{\rm T}^{-1})\).

The studies were performed on pythia dijet samples generated in intervals of \(p_{\rm T}\). The jets selected have to have \(p_{\rm T}>20\) GeV and should not overlap with other physics objects within \(R<0.4\). Afterward all tracks are selected which fall in a cone of \(R=0.4\) around reconstructed jet axis of the jet with the highest \(p_{\rm T}\). If fewer than two tracks are found for the jet, the event is rejected. The \(\Delta R\) of two tracks is then calculated for all combinations from two up to the five highest \(p_{\rm T}\) tracks in the jet. Figure 20 shows the mean of the \(\Delta R\) values (one entry per event), normalized to an integrated luminosity of 1fb\({}^{-1}\), for leading jets with \(140<p_{\rm T}^{\rm truth}<160\) GeV (top-left) and \(1120<p_{\rm T}^{\rm truth}<1280\) GeV (top-right). The two histograms correspond to the \(\Delta R\) obtained from leading two and five tracks. When more low \(p_{\rm T}\) tracks are involved, the \(\Delta R\) distribution broadens as a result of jet fragmentation.

Figure 20: Top: Distributions of the mean of the \(\Delta R\) values for the leading two (solid histogram) and five (dashed histogram) tracks in jets with \(140<p_{\rm T}^{\rm truth}<160\) GeV (left) and \(1120<p_{\rm T}^{\rm truth}<1280\) GeV (right) for an integrated luminosity of 1fb\({}^{-1}\). Bottom: Mean (left) and most probable value obtained from a Landau fit to the peak (right) of the \(\Delta R\) distributions as a function of the leading jet truth \(p_{\rm T}\) for the leading two (solid points) and five (open points) tracks. The curves represent fits with a function of the form \(p_{0}/x+p_{1}\).

The bottom plots in Fig. 20 show the mean (left) and most probable value (MPV) obtained from a Landau fit to the peak (right) of the \(\Delta R\) distributions as a function of the leading jet truth \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). Both mean and MPV are well fit by a function of the form \(p_{0}/x+p_{1}\) as shown by the curves. Figure 21 (top-left) shows the uncertainty of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) scale obtained by evaluating the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range on the curves covered by the statistical uncertainties of the data points in the bottom of Fig. 20 and dividing the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range by the jet truth \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) scale uncertainty varies significantly at high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) with different choices of \(\Delta R\) values. In general, the MPV is more stable than the mean value as it suffers less from fluctuations in jet hadronization. The MPV-based scale uncertainty seems less dependent on the leading track multiplicity in pythia-only comparisons, but the situation changes when pythia is compared with herwig as in Fig. 21 (top-right). Apparently the choice of the leading two tracks is more robust against different jet fragmentation models, and therefore the \(\Delta R\) obtained from the MPV of leading two tracks is used hereafter as a central value.

The following sources of systematic uncertainties are considered: 1) the jet fragmentation model as discussed above, 2) the track selection cuts and reconstruction inefficiencies, 3) absolute JES at low energies, and 4) the uncertainty associated with the fit. The systematic uncertainty on the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) scale is evaluated by obtaining the \(\Delta R\) versus jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions shifted by \(\pm 1\sigma\) (or the equivalent amount specified) of the source, and looking at the variation in the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) at the measured \(\Delta R\) values. For 1), the difference between pythia and herwig is assigned. For 2), the deviated distributions are obtained by

Bottom-Right: Total and individual systematic and statistical uncertainties as a function of the truth jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) expected to be obtained from the track angle method for an integrated luminosity of \(1\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\).

applying different selection cuts on tracks and assuming an extra 5% reconstruction inefficiency for tracks in jets. The JES uncertainty for low jets is assumed to be \(\pm\)5% at \(\pt^{\text{jet}}=100\GeV\), and the deviated distributions are obtained by estimating the corresponding variations in \(\Delta R\) at \(\pt^{\text{jet}}=100\GeV\) using the default fit function and transferring the variations to uncertainties on the parameters of the function. The JES deviated and default distributions are shown in Fig. 21 bottom-left. The total uncertainty obtained by adding all the systematic uncertainties and the statistical uncertainty in quadrature, and individual systematic uncertainties as a function of the jet truth are shown in the bottom-right of the figure. With the assumption of \(\pm\)5% JES uncertainty at \(\pt^{\text{jet}}=100\GeV\), the JES of 150, 300, 600, and 1200 \(\GeV\) jets can be potentially measured with an accuracy of 8, 10, 13, and 21%, respectively, with an integrated luminosity of 1fb\({}^{-1}\).

### Obtaining jet energy resolution in QCD dijet sample

A precise measurement of the jet energy resolution is necessary to model and control the systematic effects associated with it on jet observables and the quantities used in physics measurements. A key issue in estimating the jet energy and momentum resolution is the need to disentangle detector effects from those associated with physics such as the underlying event, and initial and final state radiation.

Two data-based techniques are presented which allow the jet energy resolution to be estimated, and they were compared where appropriate to the resolution obtained using particle jets: the dijet balance method, used by the DO collaboration, and the balance technique, developed by UA2 and used by CDF.

The QCD dijet events for this analysis were generated using \(\tt pythia\) in the range from 17 \(\GeV\) up to 1120 \(\GeV\). Jets were reconstructed using the cone algorithm with \(R=0.7\).

To select dijet events the following basic cuts are applied:

* One primary vertex;
* Exactly two back-to-back leading jets with \(|\Delta\phi|<0.3\) and \(\pt>10\GeV\);
* Both jets in the same region \(|\eta|<1.2\).

The \(\Delta\phi\) and minimum \(\pt\) cuts are varied for some systematic studies.

#### 5.3.1 Dijet balance method

The determination of the jet resolution in the dijet balance technique is based on energy conservation in the transverse plane. It assumes that there are only two jets in the event which have similar \(\pt\). If one defines the asymmetry distribution \(A\) for the two jets as:

\[A\equiv\frac{\pt,1-\pt,2}{\pt,1+\pt,2}\, \tag{13}\]

then for jets in the same rapidity region, which therefore have the same resolution, the fractional transverse jet energy resolution can be expressed as a function of \(\sigma_{A}\):

\[\frac{\sigma_{\pt}}{\pt}=\sqrt{2}\sigma_{A}\, \tag{14}\]

where \(\pt=(\pt,1+\pt,2)/2\).

The asymmetry distribution \(A\) for two representative bins obtained by using cone jets with \(R=0.7\) are shown in Fig. 22. The distributions have been symmetrized by computing either \(\pt,1-\pt,2\) or \(p_{\rm T,\,2}-p_{\rm T,\,1}\) randomly for each event. The resolution function is well described by a Gaussian fit, although it is worth mentioning that previous studies done by the DO Collaboration suggest using a double Gaussian fit for large \(p_{\rm T}\) bins, to absorb effects of non-Gaussian tails.

The simple dijet balance method does not return the true fractional transverse energy resolution associated purely with detector effects, since the two leading jets of an event could be imbalanced due to undetected jets in the event with \(p_{\rm T}<10\) GeV such as from soft radiation. This radiation will broaden the resolution function and a correction may be derived by studying the effect of the cut on the \(p_{\rm T}\) of any third jet in the event as described in the next section.

#### 5.3.2 Soft radiation correction

In our basic event selection, both the \(\Delta\phi\) cut and the cut requiring exactly two jets with \(p_{\rm T}>10\) GeV are implemented in order to reduce the broadening of the \(p_{\rm T}\) balance distribution due to soft radiation effects. However, the effects are not fully suppressed, as further jets with \(p_{\rm T}<10\) GeV may remain in the selected events. To account for this effect, the jet resolution is computed by allowing a third jet with transverse momentum \(p_{\rm T,\,3}\) up to some threshold \(\epsilon\), and varying the threshold values between \(\epsilon=12.5\) and \(27.5\) GeV. As before, the resolution distributions in the jet \(p_{\rm T}\) bins are fitted using single Gaussian functions. For each jet \(p_{\rm T}\) bin, the set of resolutions obtained from the different \(p_{\rm T,\,3}\) thresholds are fitted with a straight line and extrapolated to \(\epsilon=0\). We define this value as:

\[\left(\frac{\sigma_{p_{\rm T}}}{p_{\rm T}}\right)^{p_{\rm T,\,3}\to 0}, \tag{15}\]

which would be the resolution that we would have measured from an ideal dijet sample with \(\epsilon=0\). Examples of the linear fits and the extrapolations for two \(p_{\rm T}\) bins are presented in Fig. 23.

After fitting the resolution for the different third jet thresholds, we calculate a correction factor, \(K(p_{\rm T})\), as follows:

\[K(p_{\rm T})=\left(\frac{\sigma_{p_{\rm T}}}{p_{\rm T}}\right)^{p_{\rm T,\,3} \to 0}/\left(\frac{\sigma_{p_{\rm T}}}{p_{\rm T}}\right)^{\epsilon=10\ \rm GeV}. \tag{16}\]

Figure 22: Asymmetry distributions of two jets for two representative \(p_{\rm T}\) bins. Cone jets with \(R=0.7\) in the pseudorapidity region \(|\eta|<1.2\) are used. The distributions were fitted with a single Gaussian function.

Finally, correcting by this factor, the unbiased fractional transverse energy resolution is obtained via

\[\left(\frac{\sigma_{p_{\mathrm{T}}}}{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\right)_{\mathrm{corrected}}=K( p_{\mathrm{T}})\times\left(\frac{\sigma_{p_{\mathrm{T}}}}{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\right)_{ \mathrm{uncorrected}}^{\epsilon=10\ \mathrm{GeV}}. \tag{17}\]

Since the soft radiation bias should be larger at small transverse energies, and negligible at high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)  we parametrize \(K(p_{\mathrm{T}})\), with the function:

\[K(p_{\mathrm{T}})=1-\exp\left(a-bp_{\mathrm{T}}\right)\,. \tag{18}\]

This parametrization can be used to correct the resolution for each \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bin and determine the unbiased resolution associated purely with detector effects. The jet energy resolutions with and without the soft radiation correction are shown in Fig. 24. As we will see below, by comparing this result to that obtained by other approaches we can establish an estimate of the systematic uncertainty of the jet energy resolution.

#### 5.3.3 The \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance technique

The balance technique was developed by UA2 and studied at CDF. To extract the contributions of detector effects on to the jet energy resolution, the imbalance vector \(\vec{K}_{T}=\vec{p}_{T,1}+\vec{p}_{T,2}\) is projected onto two components (\(\psi\),\(\eta\)) as shown in Fig. 25.

The \(\eta\) axis corresponds to the azimuthal angular bisector of the dijet system while the \(\psi\) axis is defined as being orthogonal to the \(\eta\) axis. The two components, \(K_{T,\psi}\) and \(K_{T,\eta}\), are sensitive to different effects. The calorimeter energy resolution represents the main source for \(\sigma_{\psi}\), the spread of \(K_{T,\psi}\). Gluon radiation effects are smaller but affect this component as well. On the other hand, \(\sigma_{\eta}\), the spread of \(K_{T,\eta}\), is significantly affected by gluon radiation. In addition, there are other smaller effects such as jet angular resolution, underlying event and out-of-cone fluctuations. In order to reduce the hard gluon radiation effects, events with \(p_{\mathrm{T},\,3}>11\)  are rejected. If we define the contributions from the calorimeter resolution, \(\sigma_{\mathrm{res}}\), and from soft radiation, \(\sigma_{\mathrm{SR}_{\parallel}}\) and \(\sigma_{\mathrm{SR}_{\perp}}\), then we can write

\[\sigma_{\psi}^{2} = \sigma_{\mathrm{res}}^{2}+\sigma_{\mathrm{SR}_{\parallel}}^{2}\] \[\sigma_{\eta}^{2} = \sigma_{\mathrm{SR}_{\perp}}^{2}\.\]

Figure 23: Resolution versus the \(p_{\mathrm{T},\,3}\) threshold cut for different \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bins. The line corresponds to the linear fit applied while the dashed-line shows the extrapolation to \(p_{\mathrm{T},\,3}=0\), which corresponds to an ideal dijet sample (\(\epsilon=0\)).

Assuming

\[\sigma^{2}_{\rm SR_{\rm j}}=\sigma^{2}_{\rm SR_{\rm L}}\, \tag{19}\]

the soft radiation effects are removed by subtracting in quadrature \(\sigma_{\eta}\) from \(\sigma_{\psi}\):

\[\sigma_{\rm res}=\sqrt{\sigma_{\psi}^{2}-\sigma_{\eta}^{2}}. \tag{20}\]

The data sample was divided into six \(p_{\rm T}\) regions, and the distributions \(K_{T,\eta}\) and \(K_{T\psi}\) were fitted with single Gaussians. Since in this method the measured resolution comes from the convolution of the single jet resolution, to obtain the single jet energy resolution, \(\sigma_{\rm res}\) must be scaled by a factor \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\).

Figure 26 shows the resulting \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sigma_{\psi}\) and \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sigma_{\eta}\) as a function of the square root of the average \(p_{\rm T}\) of both jets. \(\sigma_{\psi}\) has an approximately linear dependence with \(\sqrt{\langle p_{\rm T_{1,2}}\rangle}\), while \(\sigma_{\eta}\) has a flat dependence, especially at high \(p_{\rm T}\), as expected. The effective jet energy resolution after removing soft radiation effects by subtracting in quadrature \(\sigma_{\eta}\) from \(\sigma_{\psi}\) is shown in Fig. 27.

#### 5.3.4 Comparison of dijet and \(k_{\rm T}\) balance techniques

A comparison of the two methods, the dijet balance and the \(k_{\rm T}\) balance technique, allows an estimate of the systematic uncertainty associated with the determination of the resolution associated with detector response. By comparing the reconstructed jets with the jets from Monte Carlo truth we obtain information on its dependence on the jet algorithm and the jet matching. Each of the first two leading calorimeter jets is matched to particle jets, which lie within \(\Delta R<0.1\) w.r.t. the reconstructed jet. After matching, the response \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm calo}/p_{\rm T}^{\rm truth}\) is determined, and the true resolution is obtained by fitting the response with single Gaussians. This is shown in Fig. 28 together with the results from the two data-driven estimates.

The two data-driven approaches agree within uncertainties, though a hint that the \(k_{\rm T}\) method is underestimating the true detector resolution might be visible. The determination of the resolution using reconstructed jets matched to particle jets gives results in between the two data-driven approaches and together with them provides a reasonable basis from which to estimate the systematic uncertainties in the determination of the noise, stochastic and constant terms in the jet energy resolution.

Summary and conclusions

Precise reconstruction of the jet energy is required by many physics analyses. In-situ processes provide the platform against which our understanding, based on theory and detector simulation, must be tested in order to achieve maximum precision. From the analyses presented in this paper, we conclude that one can characterize three ranges of jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), in which the different features of detector response and underlying physics control the precision which can be achieved.

From the reconstruction threshold of \(10\,\mathrm{GeV}\) up to \(\sim 100-200\,\mathrm{GeV}\), the combination of effects from jet clustering and physics effects like ISR/FSR and underlying event can be as large as \(5-10\%\) at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), slowly decreasing to the percent level around \(100-200\,\mathrm{GeV}\). With QCD dijet events, we will be able to control the uniformity of the response on the percent level with high granularity in \(\phi\) and \(\eta\) already with \(\sim 10\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\). In turn, \(Z+\mathrm{jet}\) balance is an adequate process to measure the absolute energy scale with a statistical precision of \(1\%\) with approximately \(300\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) of data. Hence the precision will rather quickly be dominated by the systematic uncertainty. Validation of the Monte Carlo simulation to ensure that both physics and detector effects are well modeled will be particularly important to control systematic uncertainties. Differences between currently available Monte Carlo generators are on the level of \(5-10\%\) in some of the observables, which sets the scale for the challenge in this region of jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

The medium \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region extends from \(100-200\,\mathrm{GeV}\) to about \(500\,\mathrm{GeV}\). Physics effects are at the level of \(1-2\%\) in this region. The momenta of the particles resulting from jet fragmentation are within the range of the test beam measurement. It will be an important range in which to validate the Monte Carlo description of the detector response. In addition the dijet balance is still statistically powerful, and \(1\%\) precision for an \(\eta\) bin size of \(0.1\) can be achieved with \(\sim 100\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\). In \(\gamma+\mathrm{jet}\) events the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance can be measured with negligible bias from QCD background. The statistical precision is better than one percent for \(10\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) at \(100\,\mathrm{GeV}\), and in the range \(300-500\,\mathrm{GeV}\) the percent level is reached with \(\sim 100\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\).

Above \(500\,\mathrm{GeV}\), one enters a regime which is beyond any existing jet measurement and extrapolation of the Monte Carlo modeling and comparison to in-situ data is crucial. A much larger integrated luminosity is required for in-situ measurements of similar precision. In addition, for the highest momentum particles which may be produced in these jets, our simulation of the detector no longer has test beam data available as a basis. Techniques such as multijet balancing or extrapolation based on jet particle properties can be used and should allow us to control the scale at the level of a few percent with \(1\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) for jets up to \(1\,\mathrm{TeV}\).
