Comparison of selected ATLAS top pair differential cross section measurements to NLO QCD predictions.

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

Differential \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section results have been published by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC for a variety of kinematic distributions using an integrated luminosity of 2 \(\mbox{fb}^{-1}\) proton-proton collision data collected at a center-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. Some of these distributions can potentially be used to improve the precision of the parton distribution functions. In this document we compare select differential spectra with predictions determined at NLO QCD using the MCFM program and accounting for a wide variety of theoretical systematic uncertainties. The data are compared with each of the following PDF models with NLO accuracy: CT10, MSTW 2008, NNPDF 2.3, HERAPDF1.5, and ABM11.

Introduction

Various differential top anti-top pair (\(t\bar{t}\)) distributions have been published by the ATLAS collaboration [1]. Of these distributions the two that are observed to have the greatest sensitivity to the effects of proton parton distribution functions (PDFs) are the invariant mass and rapidity of the \(t\bar{t}\) system. These distributions, when measured at the LHC, both have significant sensitivity to the gluon PDF distribution and can potentially be used to improve the precision of PDF fits. In this document these distributions are presented and compared directly with the predictions of the NLO QCD calculation implemented in MCFM [2] interfaced to a variety of alternate PDF sets. The comparisons include uncertainties in the theoretical calculations originating from the factorization and renormalization scales, the strong coupling constant (\(\alpha_{S}(M_{Z})\)), and the uncertainty in the top quark mass. The uncertainty due to the LHC beam energy is also evaluated. Since the theoretical predictions for the measured variables show a dependence on the PDF choice that is larger than other modeling uncertainties, future improved measurements of these distributions will improve the accuracy of future PDF fits.

## 2 Top differential cross section measurements

In this document select kinematic distributions of \(t\bar{t}\) events in ATLAS data [1] are compared with various theoretical predictions. The measured distributions were the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), rapidity (\(y_{t\bar{t}}\)), and invariant mass (\(m_{t\bar{t}}\)) of the \(t\bar{t}\) system in the single-lepton decay channel using 2.05 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data collected at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. The distributions were fully unfolded to determine the true distributions as defined using the truth-level kinematics of the simulated top quarks after final state radiation. The distributions were further normalized by their own inclusive cross-sections, ensuring that comparisons with various models only probe kinematic differences.

## 3 Theoretical predictions and uncertainties

In this document theoretical predictions are determined for the measured \(t\bar{t}\) kinematic distributions using MCFM at NLO, interfaced with Applgrid [3] to convolve the perturbative coefficients with the strong coupling and the PDF. The PDFs chosen for comparison were CT10 [4], MSTW2008 [5], NNPDF23 [6], HERAPDF1.5 [7], and ABM11 [8]. Among these these PDF sets CT10 and NNPDF23 were determined using an \(\alpha_{S}(M_{Z})\) value of 0.118, and HERAPDF1.5 was determined using an \(\alpha_{S}(M_{Z})\) value of 0.1176. For MSTW 2008 and ABM11 the \(\alpha_{S}(M_{Z})\) value was determined simultaneously as part of the fit, resulting in a value of 0.12018 for MSTW 2008 and 0.1134 for ABM11. All of these PDF sets were determined to NLO QCD accuracy. In addition to differences in how the PDF calculations are performed, there are some differences in which experimental datasets are included in the formulations.

For each theoretical prediction the renormalization and factorization scales are set equal to the top mass, which is assumed to be 172.5 GeV, though variations on these assumptions were considered in systematic studies. As for the measurements in data, each of the distributions are normalized by their own respective inclusive cross-section. These inclusive cross-sections (as determined by the NLO PDF predictions) are 152 pb for CT10, 162 pb for MSTW2008, 160 pb for NNPDF23, 139 pb for HERAPDF1.5, and 126 for ABM11.

Uncertainties that are considered on the theory prediction for these distributions are as follows. When determining a total theory uncertainty the sources of uncertainty listed below are added in quadrature.

* PDF uncertainties according to the recommendations of each PDF set, allowing for asymmetric errors in all cases except for NNPDF23. For HERAPDF1.5 the parametrization and modeling uncertainties are included. In each case uncertainties are scaled to a 68% confidence interval.

Since the CT10 collaboration reports "90%" confidence errors, the size of the uncertainties are divided by 1.645 for consistency.
* Uncertainty on the renormalization and factorization scales. These scales are initially set to the top mass. To evaluate their uncertainties they are varied up and down by a factor of two, and the shifts in the results are used to assign asymmetric uncertainties. This uncertainty is evaluated independently for the renormalization and the factorization scales.
* Uncertainty on the LHC beam energy. The LHC beam energy has recently been determined to have a value of \(3988\pm 5(\text{stat})\pm 26(\text{syst})\) GeV when running at an expected energy of 4000 GeV [9]. While no similar measurement is available for 3.5 TeV beams, it is expected that this measurement should scale proportionally. It is therefore assumed that the same relative uncertainty can be used. When determining beam energy uncertainties a 1% uncertainty (chosen to be large enough to cover a one-sigma downward uncertainty on the measurement) on the collision energy with an assumed central value of \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV is applied by varying the collision energy in MCFM and re-determining the kinematic distributions.
* Uncertainty on the strong coupling constant, \(\alpha_{S}\). For the CT10, NNPDF23, and HERAPDF1.5 PDF sets these are determined by varying the \(\alpha_{S}\) that is used for the baseline sample by 0.002 up or down and taking half of the full difference as a 90% confidence level uncertainty. This systematic was further scaled to a 68% confidence level uncertainty of 0.0012 by dividing by 1.645. In the case of MSTW2008 since the \(\alpha_{S}(M_{Z})\) value is determined directly from the fit the uncertainty from the output of the fit is used instead. In the case of ABM11 as the PDF uncertainty can only be determined simultaneously with the \(\alpha_{S}\) there is no separate evaluation of this uncertainty.
* Uncertainty on the top mass. The top mass baseline value that is used for this study is 172.5 GeV, which is slightly lower than the latest world-average top mass result is \(173.4\pm 0.6\pm 0.8\) GeV. For this document the top mass uncertainty is taken by varying the top mass up to 173.5 GeV and down to 171.5 GeV to determine an asymmetric systematic uncertainty. This variation was chosen to match the size of the world-average uncertainty.

It should be remembered that all predictions are determined only at NLO QCD precision and that electroweak corrections may also be non-negligible. For example, electroweak Sudakov corrections have been estimated for the \(m_{t\bar{t}}\) distribution [10]. Applying this correction would make the distribution slightly softer, by roughly a 4% correction in the value of the highest bin compared to bins at lower \(m_{t\bar{t}}\). No similar corrections have yet been calculated for the \(y_{t\bar{t}}\) spectrum. Electroweak corrections are currently neither applied nor considered in the systematic uncertainties of this document.

## 4 Results

The two distributions from the ATLAS data that show the greatest sensitivity to PDFs are the invariant mass and the rapidity of the \(t\bar{t}\) system. Before comparing with the data itself, a comparison is made between the predictions of the individual PDFs. In Figure 1 a comparison is made of the NLO PDF predictions of each of these distributions, where the vertical width of the points represents the size of the PDF uncertainties. It is interesting to note that there is tension between some of these PDF sets, especially in the \(m_{t\bar{t}}\) distribution. The other modeling uncertainties of Section 3 are also compared in Figure 2. It can be seen that some other sources of uncertainty such as on the renormalization scale are significant. Finally, Figure 3 shows a comparison between the data and the theoretical predictions, where the vertical width of the theory bands represent the total uncertainty after accounting for all six sources of modeling error added in quadrature.

In total there are five degrees of freedom for the invariant mass distribution and six degrees of freedom for the rapidity distribution. In each case the \(\chi^{2}\) probability of agreement between data and modeling is shown, taking the experimental uncertainties and bin-to-bin correlation matrices of the data into account. In the case of the invariant mass distribution the \(\chi^{2}\) probabilities turn out to be fairly high as all distributions show good agreement with the data. In contrast, for the rapidity distribution the \(\chi^{2}\) probability is 83% for NNPDF 2.3 but is only 21% for CT10. The reader should also remember that these comparisons are made only with respect to a model at NLO QCD accuracy, and that electroweak corrections such as those of [10] have not been applied.

## 5 Summary

Comparisons have been made between 2 fb\({}^{-1}\) of 7 TeV ATLAS data and various NLO QCD predictions of the distributions for the invariant mass and rapidity of the \(t\bar{t}\) system. In particular, different PDFs have been compared at NLO with the data, and many other sources of modeling uncertainty have been considered. Accounting for these uncertainties, the rapidity distribution appears to be especially well suited for future measurements to constrain PDFs. Electroweak corrections and uncertainties are not fully available for these distributions and therefore cannot be applied, though for the invariant mass spectrum they are expected to be small. It is likely that once these corrections are determined, and once more precise experimental measurements become available in the future, these distributions will allow the PDF models to be constrained.
