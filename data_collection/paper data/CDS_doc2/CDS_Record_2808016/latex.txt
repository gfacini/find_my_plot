## 1 Introduction

The energetic proton-proton (\(pp\)) collisions produced by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) predominantly result in a large number of charged and neutral hadrons that form collimated sprays known as jets. In the ATLAS experiment [1] the energies of these particles are measured using the calorimeters, and a tracking system measures the momentum of the charged particles. A particle-flow algorithm [2] is used to take advantage of these two systems in the reconstruction of jets. Jets are calibrated on average using Monte Carlo simulations and a series of corrections derived by comparing the simulation to data [3; 4; 5]. This calibration of jets to the correct jet energy scale (JES) plays an important role in many searches for new physics and measurements of Standard Model processes [6; 7; 8; 9].

The JES uncertainty represents our knowledge of the calibration of the jets in data and is a limiting factor in many ATLAS precision analysis. For a large part of the jet transverse momentum, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), spectrum, in the central region \(|y|<0.7\), the largest component of the JES uncertainty comes from the dependence of the detector response to jets on the flavour of the initiating hard scattering parton (_quarks_ or _gluons_). Different jet flavours lead to a different internal jet structure - _gluon_ initiated jets are expected to have higher multiplicity, a softer hadron spectrum and a broader shape due to the stronger colour charge of _gluons_[10]. This uncertainty is presently estimated by comparing Monte Carlo simulation models [3; 4; 5].

This note investigates how the simulated ATLAS detector response to jets depends on the Monte Carlo simulation model for different flavours of jets. In particular the dependence on the hadronization model, the model used to convert fragmented partons into the stable particles entering the ATLAS detector in the Monte Carlo generators, is studied. A particular focus is the particle type dependence such as differences between meson-baryon or pion-kaon interactions with the ATLAS detector.

The aim of this note is to provide input for the Monte Carlo generator community of what features significantly affect experimental uncertainties and also motivate experimental measurements that might be useful in constraining some of these features. A better understanding of the model dependence of the JES can lead to improved methods to set the JES systematic uncertainties and could also result in Monte Carlo generator dependent corrections which could reduce the differences observed when samples produced with different generators are compared in many analyses.

The note is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the ATLAS detector. Section 3 describes the samples of simulated events used in the studies. The ATLAS jet calibration is summarized and the jet response for various Monte Carlo models is shown in Section 4. In Section 5 the fraction of jet momentum carried by different hadrons is investigated. The dependence of the jet response on these quantities is then shown in Section 6 and the effect on the response when re-weighting simulated events to have the same baryon and kaon energy fractions is shown in Section 7. Finally, the conclusions are presented in Section 8.

## 2 ATLAS detector

The ATLAS experiment [11; 12; 1] at the LHC is a multipurpose particle detector with a forward-backward symmetric cylindrical geometry and a near \(4\pi\) coverage in solid angle.1 It consists of an inner trackingdetector surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T axial magnetic field, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer.

The inner tracking detector covers the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<2.5\). Radially outwards, it consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and transition radiation tracking detectors.

Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements with high granularity. A central barrel covers \(|\eta|<1.475\) and endcaps cover \(1.375<|\eta|<3.2\). A steel/scintillator-tile (Tile) hadron calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range with one barrel covering \(|\eta|<1\) and extended barrels also covering \(0.8<|\eta|<1.7\). These are longitudinally segmented in shower depth into three layers. Hadronic calorimetry in the endcaps is provided by a copper/liquid-argon calorimeter which consists of four layers. The forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements up to \(|\eta|=4.9\). Additionally LAr pre-sampler and Tile crack scintillators recover energy lost in non-instrumented regions.

The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large air-core toroidal superconducting magnets with eight coils each. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 T m across most of the detector. The muon spectrometer includes a system of precision tracking chambers and fast detectors for triggering.

## 3 Samples of simulated events

Samples of simulated events with hadronic jets produced through pure quantum chromodynamic (QCD) processes are created using Monte Carlo techniques. They are simulated with a variety of Monte Carlo generators and using re-tuned model parameters as summarized in Table 1.

The nominal sample used in the calibration of jets in ATLAS is produced using Pythia 8.235 [13] with the A14 set of tuned parameters [14]. Pythia8 uses a leading-order \(2\to 2\) matrix element interfaced with a parton distribution function (PDF) to model the hard process. The PDF used is NNPDF2.3LO[15]. Additional radiation is modelled in the leading-logarithm approximation using \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-ordered parton showers. Multiple parton-parton interactions and underlying event are also simulated. Hadronization is based on the Lund string model [16; 17], and EvtGen 1.6.0 [18] is used to decay heavy hadrons.

Two Herwig 7.1[19] samples are used as alternative generators to the nominal Pythia8 sample. Both samples are produced using Herwig 7.1.6 and use a leading order \(2\to 2\) matrix elements interfaced with the NNPDF2.3LO PDF. One sample was produced using an angular ordered parton shower [20] and the other a dipole shower [21; 22] using splitting kernels based on the Catani-Seymour subtraction scheme [23; 24]. Herwig 7 implements a cluster based hadronization model [25] and this is used in both samples. Heavy hadrons are then decayed using EvtGen 1.7.0 [18]. The free model parameters are tuned to data [26; 27].

Finally three Sherpa[28; 29] samples are also considered. Two samples are produced using Sherpa 2.2.5 with the CT14nnlo PDF [30]. A leading-order \(2\to 2\) matrix element is interfaced with a parton shower using Catani-Seymour dipole factorisation [31]. In the first sample the default cluster based hadronization module ahadic++[32] is used, while in the second sample the interface to the Lund string model in Pythia 6.4 [33] is used. The third sample is produced using Sherpa 2.2.11 with the same PDF and matrix element and also uses the parton shower with Catani-Seymour dipole factorisation and ahadic++ cluster based hadronization. A re-tuned set of parameters provided by the Sherpa authors [34] for the hadronization model is used in this sample that are listed in the Appendix in Table 2. These re-tuned parameters improve the agreement with the LEP data of the fractions of different hadrons within hadronic jets [34]. In all samples the internal Hadrons++ module is used to decay heavy hadrons.

All samples were passed through a detailed simulation of the ATLAS detector [35] based on Geant4[36]. The modelling of hadron interactions was done by the FTFP_BERT_ATL[37] physics list. In this physics list the _Bertini cascade model_[38] is used for hadrons with energy below 12 GeV, and the _Fritiof string model_[39, 40] for hadrons with energy above 9 GeV. The probability of using each model changes smoothly across the region of overlap.

Furthermore, simulated inclusive inelastic \(pp\) collisions were overlaid to model additional pile-up collisions in the same and neighbouring bunch crossings. These were generated with Pythia 8.210 [13] with the A3 tune [41] and NNPDF2.3Lo PDF set. The pile-up conditions simulated are designed to match those present during the Run 2 data-taking period.

## 4 ATLAS jet calibration and response with various Monte Carlo models

Jets are reconstructed in the ATLAS experiment either from _topological clusters_ of calorimeter cells [42] to form calorimeter jets, or from _particle flow objects_[2] that combine track momentum measurements for relatively low energy charged particles and calorimeter measurements for high energy charged particles and all neutral particles. The former are called _EMTopo_ jets and the latter _Particle Flow_ jets. In both cases the energy deposits in the ATLAS calorimeters are calibrated at the electromagnetic scale such that the energy deposited in electromagnetic showers is correctly reconstructed (\(\langle E_{\mathrm{reco}}/E_{\mathrm{true}}\rangle=1\)). Due to non-compensating nature of the ATLAS calorimeters [43] the energy deposited by hadronic showers will be reconstructed on average lower than the true deposited energy and will therefore appear to be under-calibrated (\(\langle E_{\mathrm{reco}}/E_{\mathrm{true}}\rangle<1\)). Moreover the average of the ratio of reconstructed over true deposited energy depends on the energy of the showering hadron.

Jets are calibrated with a series of corrections to restore the average energy of the reconstructed detector jets to that of the jets formed by the particles impinging the detector (_truth jets_) [5]. _Truth jets_ are reconstructed from stable truth particles, defined as those with lifetimes longer than 33 ps, excluding muons and neutrinos. For both _reconstructed_ and _truth jets_, the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [44] is used with radius parameter, \(R=0.4\), implemented in FastJet[45, 46]. When _pile-up_ is included in reconstructed samples these particles do not enter _truth jets_.

Table 1: The six different Monte Carlo samples considered in this note. For each sample the generator and tune, if different from default, as well as the PDF are listed. The basis of the parton shower is given and the model used for the hadronization process. Finally the program used to decay heavy flavour hadrons is given.

The calibration consists of a series of corrections based on Monte Carlo simulated samples followed by a _data-based_ correction from the _in situ_ measurement of the JES using di-jet, \(Z(\to\ell\ell)\)+jet, \(\gamma\)+jet and multijet events [5]. In addition to the uncertainties on the _in situ_ measurement additional uncertainties cover possible mis-modelings in the simulation of the extrapolation from the population of jets used in the _in situ_ measurements to other event topologies and physics processes. In particular, when considering the effect of different physics models in the event generators, it is important to note that there are corrections in the calibration sequence that account for the number of tracks associated with the jet and the width of the spread of the associated tracks to reduce the dependence of the calibrated response on the fragmentation of the jet [5].

For a given truth jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) the jet response, i.e. the mean of the ratio of reconstructed detector jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) after calibration and the _truth jets_\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), can be determined in simulation. The response is determined by iteratively fitting a Gaussian over the range of \(\pm 1.5\sigma\) to the distribution of the ratio of the reconstructed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) divided by the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of a _truth_ jet. The _truth_ and _reconstructed_ jets are required to be matched within \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\phi)^{2}+(\Delta\eta)^{2}}<0.3\). Additionally, the jet should be isolated, i.e. there are no other truth jets or reconstructed jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>10\) GeV within \(\Delta R<0.8\) of the matched truth jet.

The studies in this note are restricted to the central region of the detector where the JES is known most accurately [5]. The ratio of the jet response between the default Pythia8 sample, used to derive the jet calibration, and the various other Monte Carlo simulation samples described in section 3 is shown in figure 1. Throughout this note _Particle Flow_ jets are used in the different studies. The overall trends seen though all the studies are very similar for both _Particle Flow_ and _EMTopo_ jets with small differences in their numerical size. Therefore, the figures for _Particle Flow_ jets are shown in the body of the note and the equivalent plots with _EMTopo_ jets can be found in the Appendix.

For jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) above about 100 GeV the Sherpa sample using the Lund string models agrees well with the Pythia8 sample while the Sherpa 2.2.5 sample based on the ahadic++ cluster fragmentation model is similar to the Herwig 7 sample based on the cluster model. This effect is only 1-2%, but it is large when compared to the achieved precision on the JES _in-situ_ calibration (about 0.5-1%) [5]. For low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), a similar behaviour is observed, but larger differences within the cluster- and string-based hadronization models are seen.

Differences are also seen between the two parton shower models implemented in Herwig 7 but they are relatively smaller; \(\lesssim 0.5\%\). The Sherpa sample based on the ahadic++ cluster fragmentation model using the re-tuned baryon-fractions is similar to the Pythia8 and Sherpa MC samples based on the Lund model. This suggests that differences in the hadronization model induce the majority of the observed response difference.

Hadronic jets that are initiated by a hard scattering _quark_ or _gluon_ are expected to have different properties, since the spectra of the final particle depend on the parton fragmentation phase. The labeling of jets as either _quark-_ or _gluon-_initiated is not well defined at higher orders in QCD but for simplicity jets are labeled based on the identity of the highest energy parton independent of its appearance in the simulated final-state event record that is _ghost associated_[47] to the jet. All jets passing the kinematic selections in the simulated samples considered are found to have at least one associated parton. We label _quark_ jets as those with the highest energy parton being \([d,\bar{d},u,\bar{u},s,\bar{s}]\) and label _gluon_ jets as those with the highest energy parton being a gluon. This definition depends on technical details how the Monte Carlo organizes the event record. However, since the highest energetic parton is taken the definition is able to capture differences in the jet fragmentation that are relevant to the interaction of the jet with the ATLAS detector. Jets where the highest energy matched parton is _charm_ or _bottom_ are not considered as _quark_ jets since these will have significantly different fragmentation due to their large masses, and additionally will contain heavy flavour hadrons. The study of these heavy flavour jets is beyond the scope of this note and they are not included in either category.

Figure 2 shows the response as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) relative to the default Pythia8 sample separated into _quark_ and _gluon_ jets. Again, the Monte Carlo simulation models based on the Lund string model show a different behaviour than the cluster-based models. However, this effect is larger for _gluon_ jets than for _quark_ jets.

For _gluon_ jets the deviation increases with decreasing jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). It is 3% for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=30\GeV\) and 0.5% for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=2000\GeV\). For \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<60\GeV\) a difference is also observed between the Sherpa Lund model and Pythia8. The Sherpa MC with the ahadic++ hadronization model and using the re-tuned baryon-fractions is close to Sherpa with the Lund model for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>60\GeV\).

For _quark_ jets the cluster-based and the string-based models also show distinct differences, but the effect is smaller (\(<0.5\%\)) and less \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) dependent. The difference of the jet response for _quark_ and _gluon_ jets is directly shown in figure 3. _Quark_ jets are observed to have a higher response below \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\sim 200\GeV\) in all generators. However, the difference is significantly larger in the string-based models compared to the cluster-based models. Within the cluster-based models the Herwig 7 samples show smaller differences between _quark_ and _gluon_ jets than seen in the Sherpa models.

Several effects can result in differences in the jet response. The calorimeter response of hadronic particles

Figure 1: The ratio of the jet response for _Particle Flow_ jets in the rapidity range \(|\eta|<0.7\) derived from various simulation samples to the jet response of the default Pythia8 sample as a function of the _truth jet_\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The jet response is defined by the fitted mean of the ratio of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of matched _reconstructed_ and _truth_ jets, \(\mu(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{reco.}}/p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{true}})\). Shown are inclusive jets from samples with jets produced through pure QCD processes.

rises with energy [43] such that the momentum spectrum of the particles associated with the jet is expected to play an important role in the modeling of the hadronic jet response. This makes the jet response dependent on the modelling of the fragmentation of the jet which will differ between the Monte Carlo generators.

Additionally, the particle types will also play a role. When baryons and kaons are produced, the types and kinematic quantities of the particles associated to the jets will be distinctly modified with respect to the inclusive case. This can lead to a modified jet response. For instance, neutral pions decay to two photons and therefore the energy measured in the calorimeter will be calibrated, and higher than that for charged pions. Baryons will also have a lower response than neutral pions due to the non-compensating nature of the calorimeter. Negatively, positively and neutral charged pions are expected to be equally produced in the hadronization process through isospin symmetry. However, when baryons are also produced the overall energy fraction of pions gets reduced and therefore there will be a lower fraction of energy deposited by neutral pions in the jet for which the full deposited energy is reconstructed in the calorimeter. This will then result in a lower response.

Neutral kaons mainly decay to charged pions or are long-lived, and therefore have a similar response as charged pions. The charged kaon lifetime is such that they are likely to reach the calorimeter before decaying and will shower hadronically. Therefore the presence of kaons also reduces the energy fraction of the jet carried by neutral pions which have a calibrated response. Moreover, the hadronic interactions of baryons and mesons such as \(\pi^{\pm}\), \(p\), \(\bar{p}\), \(n\), \(\bar{n}\), \(K^{\pm}\), \(K^{0}_{L}\) with the detector have some known differences that can lead to slightly different responses [48]. This has, for instance, been measured for pions and protons in the ATLAS central hadronic calorimeter in test-beams [49, 50]. Compared to pions, protons induce hadronic shower that penetrate less deeply into the calorimeter but are wider laterally and their reconstructed deposited energy is a few percent lower. The response of the calorimeter to charged kaons is in between those of pions and protons [50].

Therefore, the mixture of different hadrons within a jet as well as their momentum fraction will have an impact on the response of calorimeter jets. For _Particle Flow_ jets, the reconstructed track momentum

Shown are jets initiated by _quarks_\(2\)(a) and _gluons_\(2\)(b).

is sometimes used for charged hadrons resulting in both them and neutral pions being well calibrated. However, for neutral particles and charged particles not selected by the particle flow algorithm, the same arguments hold as for calorimeter jets so the hadron content and their momentum spectrum is also expected to have an effect.

For both calorimeter and _Particle Flow_ jets the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is corrected as function of the track properties in the jet calibration sequence but this is not able to remove completely the underlying effects such that the response is still expected to depend on the properties outlined above.

Therefore both the fragmentation pattern and hadron content are expected to affect the jet response and need to be tuned to experimental measurements. Previous measurements of the internal structure of jets at the LHC have focused on the fragmentation pattern [10], the _jet shape_[51, 52] and the reconstruction of the momentum splitting structure due to radiation using cluster algorithms [53, 54] rather than the identification of the individual light flavour hadrons within jets. This motivates this study in the Monte Carlo simulation to determine if the hadron content of jets forms an important difference between Monte Carlo generators in the context of the hadronic jet response. This would serve to motivate future measurements of the hadron content of jets in data.

The differences in the relative jet resolution between the different simulated samples are small: \(0.01-0.02\) below \(50\GeV\) and extremely small at high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). Therefore the focus of this note is on the differences in the jet response. The influence of the baryon and kaon energy fraction of the jets on the response is investigated in more detail in the following.

## 5 Hadron content of jets

In order to evaluate the impact of the hadronization model on the jet response due to different hadron content, two particular properties are investigated: the fraction of the jet energy carried by baryons and that carried by charged kaons and the two neutral kaon CP eigenstates: \(K^{\pm},K_{S},K_{L}\). While many processes in

the jet fragmentation are governed to a large extend by isospin and matter-antimatter symmetries, these quantities are determined by model parameters that need to be determined experimentally. The relative suppression of kaons compared to the dominant pions is interesting as it probes strange quark production in the parton shower development. Additionally, the process of producing baryons rather than only mesons in the hadronization phase is less well understood.

The _baryon energy fraction_ is defined as the sum of energy of the stable truth particles forming the jet which are baryons divided by the energy of all particles associated to the jet. It is shown in figure 4 as a function of _truth_ jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for jets with pseudorapidity, \(|\eta|<0.7\). _Quark_ and _gluon_ jets are shown separately and the difference between the two categories is also shown. Significant differences are seen between the different Monte Carlo generator setups. The mean baryon energy fraction varies between 12-20% for _quark_ jets and _gluon_ jets at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) with a slow decrease towards higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The _quark_ and _gluon_ jets difference is 4-6% at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and about 2% at high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for Pythia8 and Sherpa Lund while it is approximately constant around 2% for original Sherpa ahadic++ and the re-tuned one. There is no difference for the Herwig samples.

Here and in the following Pythia8 is used as the reference sample. This does not reflect any greater or lesser belief in the modeling of the data by this generator but it is the sample used for the jet calibration and therefore has high statistics in both the truth and reconstructed samples used in subsequent sections.

The two Herwig 7 samples are very similar illustrating that variations in the parton shower model has only small effects seen in these distributions. The fraction of energy carried by baryons in _gluon_ jets is significantly lower than in the reference Pythia8 sample in the two Herwig 7 samples and the Sherpa 2.2.5 ahadic++ sample, while it is slightly higher in the Sherpa Lund sample and similar in the Sherpa 2.2.11 re-tuned ahadic++ sample. For _quark_ jets the differences are a little smaller. The Herwig 7 samples are very similar to the reference Pythia8 sample, but in the Sherpa 2.2.5 ahadic++ sample the fraction is much smaller than the Pythia8 sample while the other two Sherpa samples are slightly higher. When considering the difference between _quark_ and _gluon_ jets the two samples which employ cluster based hadronization models show only small differences, while there are much larger differences in the two samples which use Lund string hadronization models. The difference in baryon production in _quark_ and _gluon_ jets was also observed as a feature in the original version of the string model [55].

In figure 5 the distribution of the fraction of energy carried by baryons for three different bins of jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) are shown. The shapes of the distributions differ between _quark_ jets and _gluon_ jets in all samples, and also between the different generator setups. Both of the Herwig 7 samples show a larger fraction of jets where a very large fraction of the energy is carried by baryons than in the Pythia8 sample, but a much lower rate of baryon production at lower energy fractions. The Sherpa Lund sample is similar to the Pythia8 sample with a slightly higher rate of jets with almost all their energy carried by baryons. The Sherpa 2.2.5 ahadic++ has significantly lower baryon production, while this is more enhanced in the Sherpa 2.2.11 re-tuned ahadic++ although the shape is still slightly different to the Pythia8 sample.

The production of strange mesons within the shower is also investigated. Figure 6 shows the average fraction of energy carried by kaons as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). Very similar shapes of the distributions are seen between all the generators, although the magnitude differs slightly between the samples. The two Herwig 7 samples have slightly lower energy fractions of kaons than in Pythia8 and the difference between _gluon_ and _quark_ jets is slightly lower than the Pythia8 sample. The Sherpa 2.2.5 ahadic++ sample has a higher fraction of energy carried by kaons than the Pythia8 sample, while the other Sherpa samples are very similar to the Pythia8 sample. Figure 7 shows the differential distribution of the kaon energy fraction in three \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bins. The shapes are very similar, particularly for _quark_ jets, apart from the Sherpa 2.2.5hadic++ sample. The Herwig 7 samples have a lower kaon energy fraction than the Pythia8 sample, particularly in _gluon_ jets.

These differences between the production of baryons and kaons between generators could influence the detector response. This note focuses on the fraction of energy carried by baryons and kaons but it is also noted that there are further differences, for example in the multiplicity of the production of these particles. This is illustrated in figure 8 which shows the baryon multiplicity in the different samples for a single bin of jet \(p_{\rm T}\). Additionally, other particles could also result in differences between the generator setups, but this note focuses on the most common categories.

## 6 Dependence of the jet response on generator and hadron content

As explained in Section 5 the jet response is expected to depend on the particle content of the jet. To investigate this figure 9 shows the _Particle Flow_ jet response of _gluon_ jets and _quark_ jets as a function of the fraction of the truth jet energy carried by baryons and kaons.

It is seen that the larger the baryon fraction the lower the jet response for both _quark_ jets and _gluon_ jets. This is expected as the majority of baryons will be protons, neutrons and their anti-particles, with equal numbers of protons and neutrons through isospin symmetry. The average calorimeter response of these particles will be similar or slightly lower to \(\pi^{\pm}\), and therefore lower than a \(\pi^{+}\), \(\pi^{0}\), \(\pi^{-}\) mixture as \(\pi^{0}\) particles will decay to two photons and therefore will have a higher calorimeter response. In the reconstruction of _Particle Flow_ jets, while protons, anti-protons and charged pions will have reconstructed tracks, neutrons and anti-neutrons will rely only on calorimeter measurements so will have a lower response than the average of a mixture of pions. Therefore the same trends are expected for calorimeter jets and for those reconstructed using particle flow.

The jet response is observed to be significantly higher when the fraction of kaons is very low. This is explained as when kaons are produced rather than pions we expect the same \(2:1\) ratio for charged to neutral particles as in pions. However, the average calorimeter response to pions will be higher than the average reponse to kaons, since neutral kaons mainly decay to pions while neutral pions decay to photons. In the context of particle flow the scale of charged particles is increased due to the use of tracking for both \(\pi^{\pm}\) and \(K^{\pm}\), but the scale of \(K^{0}_{L}\) (which mainly decay in the calorimeter) will still be lower than that for \(\pi^{0}\) as these particles rely on calorimeter measurements. Therefore, for both calorimeter and _Particle Flow_ jets it is expected that the response will be lower when there are kaons present.

These trends appear to explain some of the effects that are seen in the response plots in figure 1. For example, the Sherpa 2.2.5 ahadic++ sample has a significantly lower average baryon fraction than the nominal Pythia8 sample for _gluon_ jets, which could explain the higher response seen for these jets. Similarly in the Herwig 7 samples the lower energy fractions of both baryons and kaons in _gluon_ jets compared to the nominal Pythia8 sample correlates with a higher jet response. Therefore qualitatively some of the features seen in the jet response can be attributed to the different hadron content of the jets.

## 7 Generator jet response dependence after re-weighting hadron content

In this section the effect of the different energy fraction carried by kaons and baryon on the jet energy scale is estimated by re-weighting. A two step weighting of individual jets is performed in the alternative samples. First the jets are re-weighted such that the distribution of the fraction of energy carried by baryons as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) matches that in the nominal Pythia8 sample. Secondly the jets are re-weighted such that the fraction of energy carried by kaons as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) matches that in the nominal Pythia8 sample. It is checked that this sequential re-weighting does not significantly break the initial re-weighting to make the baryon energy fractions agree. After each re-weighting the response is re-evaluated in the same way as in Section 6 and the difference quantifies the effect on the response due to the difference in the hadron energy fractions.

Figure 10 shows the response of _gluon_ and _quark_ jets in each of the generators after each re-weighting step in comparison to the nominal Pythia8 sample. The Sherpa 2.2.5 Lund sample is not shown as both the hadron energy fraction and the response is already similar to the nominal sample in this case. After re-weighting the samples to have the same baryon energy fractions the differences between the alternative samples and the reference Pythia8 sample are signficantly reduced. For _gluon_ jets the response in the Herwig samples is reduced by \(\sim\) 1% below 100 GeV, and for the Sherpa 2.2.5 ahadic++ sample it is reduced by \(\sim\) 1-1.5%.

The response in the Herwig 7 _gluon_ jet samples is further reduced by approximately 0.5% by the re-weighting of the kaon fraction. A smaller decrease is seen in the Herwig 7 _quark_ jet sample. Only a small effect is seen in the Sherpa samples. This matches the order of the size of the differences in kaon energy fraction of the different samples with respect to the Pythia8 sample.

After re-weighting both the baryon and kaon energy fractions the maximal difference in the response of _gluon_ jets between the generator configurations is approximately 1.2%, 0.8%, 0.5% for jets of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) = 30 GeV, 100 GeV, 200 GeV. This is compared to the differences before re-weighting of approximately 3%, 2%, 1.2% such that we see almost a factor of three reduction in the spread of the response. Similarly for _quark_ jets the difference between the configurations before re-weighting is approximately 1.4%, 0.5%, 0.2% for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) = 30 GeV, 100 GeVand 200 GeV, and it is reduced to approximately 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.1% after re-weighting. This reduction in the dependence on the generator configuration would result in a significant improvement in the jet energy scale uncertainties. This motivates carefully tuning these fractions in the different generators and additionally the measurement of these or related quantities that could be used in this tuning.

## 8 Conclusion

The response of jets in the ATLAS detector has been investigated using various Monte Carlo simulations based on various physics models for the event simulation. Significant variations compared to the baseline Pythia8 model are found that vary across different generator configurations.

This variation is larger for _gluon_ initiated jets than for _quark_ initiated jets. For \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=\)[30 GeV, 100 GeV, 200 GeV] jets the maximal difference between configurations is seen to be approximately 3%, 2%, 1.2%. These differences result in significant uncertainties in the jet energy scale where it is required to extrapolate from the population of jets where the jet energy scale is measured to other topologies.

The hadron content of jets is also seen to vary between the different generator configurations. In particular, the fraction of the jet energy carried by baryons and to a lesser extent kaons is seen to vary significantly between generator configurations. By re-weighting the different samples the difference in the response between the different generators for _gluon_ initiated jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=\)[30 GeV, 100 GeV, 200 GeV] jets is reduced to \(\sim\)[1.2%, 0.8%, 0.5%] which would result in a significant reduction in the jet energy scale uncertainties.

This gives a clear motivation for the careful tuning of baryon and kaon production in the generator configurations. For instance, the recent Sherpa ahadic++ model which was re-tuned to the LEP data agrees better with the Pythia8 model than the original one.

It also motivates the measurement of these quantities in LHC data to enable such tuning, as well as careful comparison to the LEP \(e^{+}e^{-}\) data. While ATLAS does have the ability to identify protons and \(K^{\pm}\) at very low momenta [56] it is not designed for measurements in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range of particles in jets at LHC. However, the ALICE detector is capable of good particle identification [57] and has already published spectra of identified particles in minimum bias collisions [58] and therefore precise measurements of the baryon and kaon energy fractions of jets are feasible. Such a measurement could have a significant impact on precision measurement of the LHC physics program.

This is the first quantitative estimate of the effect of the hadron content on the detector response of hadronic jets at the LHC, and the degree to which the differences in the hadron content in various generator configurations is responsible for the variation in the jet response.
