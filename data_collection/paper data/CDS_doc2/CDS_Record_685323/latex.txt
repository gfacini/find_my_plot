## Abstract

The second iteration of the Software Development Process of the ATLAS Event Filter has been launched. A summary of the design phase of the first iteration is given in the introduc- tion. The document gives constraints, use cases, functional and non-functional requirements for the Event Handler sub-system of the Event Filter.

## 1 Introduction

### Purpose of the document

This document presents the Requirements for the Event Handler of the ATLAS TDAQ/DCS Event Filter. They shall be the basis for the design and implementation of the Event Handler system in the context of the High Level Trigger, DAQ and DCS Technical Design Report (TDR).

The present document corresponds to the second iteration of the Software Development Process (SDP).

### Document overview

The document follows the general scheme of ATLAS requirement documents. A general description of the Event Filter system and its context is given as well as a summary of the first iteration of the SDP. We then detail the specific constraints, assumptions and dependencies, use cases and finally requirements.

In the expression of the requirements, _shall_ describes something that is mandatory ; _should_ is weaker. It describes something that might not be satisfied in the final product, but that is desirable enough that any non-compliance shall be explicitly justified ; _may_ grants permission to do something, and makes only a weak statement.

Requirements have been given a priority. _High_ means that the requirement must be fulfilled in the next implementation of the Event Handler, in view of the TDR. _Medium_ indicates a requirement which should be fulfilled in a release following the TDR. _Low_ is applied to other cases.

### Context of the Event Handler

The Event Filter (EF) system provides the final stage of the HLT event selection. It is situated downstream of the Event Builder and therefore will operate on complete event data with access to geometry and nearly final calibration constants. The Event Filter's primary function is the reduction of the rate to a value determined by the physics goals of the experiment. The final (output) rate has been evaluated by the PESA groups and is of the order of 260 Hz, while the output rate of the previous level of the trigger (2\({}^{\rm nd}\) Level Trigger or LVL2) should
