###### Abstract

We studied the feasibility to measure CP-violation in B-meson systems in LHC with a mainstream collider experiment. The decay channel \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to\psi K_{S}^{0}}\) was investigated in detail by simulating the acceptance and resolution of the ATLAS experiment. The results obtained are compared with dedicated \(b\)-physics experiments planned for the LHC.

CP Violation in Neutral B-meson systems

In the three generation Standard Model, the CP-violation originates from the single complex phase of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. Experimentally, CP-violating effects have been observed only in neutral kaon systems. The origin of the observed CP-violation, however, has not been proven yet.

B-mesons offer a direct possibility to measure whether the CP-violation is due to the CKM-matrix. Given the three generations, the unitarity constraint implies triangle relations between the matrix elements, for example

\[V_{ub}^{*}V_{ud}+V_{cb}^{*}V_{cd}+V_{tb}^{*}V_{td}=0. \tag{1}\]

Since matrix elements \(V_{ud}\simeq 1\), \(V_{tb}\simeq 1\), the relation becomes

\[V_{ub}^{*}+V_{cb}^{*}V_{cd}+V_{td}=0. \tag{2}\]

This equation presents a triangle in the complex plane, see Fig. 1. By overconstraining the triangle, i.e. measuring its three angles or two angles and one side, one can exclude for example four quark generations (in this case the 'triangle' would actually have four sides), or CP-violation originating from other sources (the triangle would collapse into a line).

Neutral B-meson decays \(\mathrm{B^{0}},\bar{\mathrm{B}}^{0}\to\mathrm{f^{0}}\) provide a theoretically well understood signature, where CP-violation parameters can be measured with a reasonable statistics. The exponential decay rate of the B-meson is modulated with the \(\mathrm{B^{0}}-\bar{\mathrm{B}}^{0}\) mixing, multiplied by a factor related to the relevant angle in the unitarity triangle. This factor is of different sign for \(\mathrm{B^{0}}\) and \(\bar{\mathrm{B}}^{0}\), thus producing a measurable asymmetry in the production rates.

The three angles, \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\) of the unitarity triangle, can be measured for example from neutral B-decays \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\), \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\to\psi K^{0}_{S}\), \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{s}}\to\rho K^{0}_{S}\), respectively. Alternatively, one can measure two angles and one side of the triangle, for example \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) and \(V_{ub}\).

Current constraints on the angles come from measurements of \(|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|\), CP-violation in \(\mathrm{K^{0}}-\bar{\mathrm{K}}^{0}\) mixing, and \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}-\bar{\mathrm{B}}^{0}_{d}\) mixing. For top masses between 90 and 200 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\), the allowed range for the angle \(\beta\) is estimated in Ref. [1] to be

\[0.08\leq\sin 2\beta\leq 1,\]

while for \(\sin 2\alpha\) and \(\sin 2\gamma\) all values are allowed.

## 2 The Decay \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\to\psi K^{0}_{S}\)

As an example, the decay channel \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\to\psi K^{0}_{S}\) was studied. The signal is experimentally the easiest one among the neutral B-meson decays involving CP-violation, and with this channel one can measure the \(\beta\) angle, for which the present experimental limits are tightest.

The time-dependent decay rates of \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\) and \(\bar{\mathrm{B}}^{0}_{d}\) are

\[N(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}(t)\to\psi K^{0}_{S}) \propto \exp^{-\Gamma t}(1-\sin 2\beta\sin\Delta mt)\] \[N(\mathrm{\bar{B}^{0}_{d}}(t)\to\psi K^{0}_{S}) \propto \exp^{-\Gamma t}(1+\sin 2\beta\sin\Delta mt) \tag{3}\]

where \(\Gamma=1/\tau\) is the average width of the B-meson weak eigenstates \(\Gamma_{1}\) and \(\Gamma_{2}\), and \(\Delta m\) is the mass difference of the eigenstates. Experimentally, \(x=\Delta m/\Gamma\simeq 0.71\pm 0.11\)[2].

The identity of the B-meson (\(\rm B^{0}_{d}\) or \(\rm\bar{B}^{0}_{d}\)) is defined by requiring a semileptonic decay of the other \(b\)-quark in the event. This is also obviously required to trigger and record the event at all.

Measurement of the CP-violation parameter \(\sin 2\beta\) can be done in two ways. If secondary vertex reconstruction in B-decays is feasible, then one can measure directly the proper time of the B-decay from the secondary vertex of the \(\psi\)-decay, and look for deviations from a pure exponential decay. The CP-violation should reveal itself as a deviation from the exponential, which is of different sign for \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\) and \(\rm\bar{B}^{0}_{d}\). The quality of the measurement is dictated by the resolution which can be obtained in fitting the proper time distributions.

A more straighforward method is to study the asymmetry, when integrating over all decay times. From Eq. 3, one obtains an average asymmetry

\[A = \frac{\Gamma(\rm B^{0}_{d}\to\psi K^{0}_{S})-\Gamma(\rm\bar{B}^{0 }_{d}\to\psi K^{0}_{S})}{\Gamma(\rm B^{0}_{d}\to\psi K^{0}_{S})+\Gamma(\rm\bar{ B}^{0}_{d}\to\psi K^{0}_{S})}\] \[= \sin 2\beta\times\frac{x}{1+x^{2}}.\]

The extra factor coming from the time-integration is roughly 0.5.

In both methods, the signal is diluted by wrong tags. \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\)and\(\rm\bar{B}^{0}_{d}\) mesons are distinguished by the charge of the lepton coming from the other \(b\) in the event. Mistags are caused by cascade decays of the \(b\), additional \(b\)-quark pairs created from the string, misidentified leptons, and \(\rm B^{0}-\bar{B}^{0}\) oscillations. If the dilution factor is defined as

\(D^{*}\)= (\(N(\rm correct\ tags)\)-\(N(\rm wrong\ tags))/N(\rm all\ tags), then the expected error on the \(\sin 2\beta\) is related to \(I\times(D^{\prime}\times\sqrt{N_{rec}})^{-1}\) for a time-dependent measurement, where the factor \(I>1\) comes from the fit of the proper time distribution, and \((D^{\prime}\times\frac{x}{1+x^{2}}\times\sqrt{N_{rec}})^{-1}\) for a time-integrated measurement.

### Production rate

A hadron collider produces large amounts of \(b\bar{b}\) final states - the production cross section is estimated to be between 100 and 700 \(\mu\)b\({}^{-1}\)[3] for LHC operating at a center of mass energy of 16 TeV. Preliminary studies for B-physics in the central production region have been made for SSC [4].

A general purpose collider detector, covering the central range in pseudorapidity, is well suited for \(b\)-physics. With a high transverse momentum lepton trigger (\(p_{T}\) defined with respect to the beam direction), \(b\bar{b}\) events dominate beyond a trigger threshold of 5 GeV/\(c\). Furthermore, the trigger requirements greatly reduce dilution effects due to misidentified leptons, which are a problem for dedicated \(b\)-experiments. Pile-up effects and ambiguities of primary vertex position can be avoided by using data collected during low luminosity operation of the machine. For LHC operating at a luminosity of \(10^{33}\)\(\rm cm^{-2}\)\(\rm s^{-1}\), the average number of collisions is roughly one per beam-beam crossing, compared to about 20 at the highest design luminosity of \(1.7\times 10^{34}\)\(\rm cm^{-2}\)\(\rm s^{-1}\).

The production rates are summarized in Table 1 for different thresholds on the transverse momentum of the triggering muon 1. The trigger muon was required to be in the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta^{\mu}|\leq 2\). The cross-sections are taken from Ref. [5]. The luminosity was assumed to be \(10^{33}\)\(\rm cm^{-2}\)\(\rm s^{-1}\), corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \(10^{4}\)\(\rm pb^{-1}\) per year.

The branching ratio \(\mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}}^{0}\rightarrow\psi\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{S}}^{0})\) is \(3.3\times 10^{-4}\)[6], with a relative uncertainty of about 50%. The total branching fraction combining \(\mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{b}\rightarrow\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}}^{0})\), \(\mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}}^{0}\rightarrow\iota\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{S}}^{0})\), \(\mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{\nu}\rightarrow\ell^{+}\ell^{-})\). \(\mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{S}}^{0}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-})\) is equal to \(1.1\times 10^{-5}\).

### Simulation

To estimate reconstruction efficiencies, events were generated with the PYTHIA Monte Carlo [7], and consequently passed through a detector simulation (see Appendix A). The nominal beam energy was 8 TeV. Cuts on the signal were: a) \(\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{S}}^{0}\) decay length in the transverse plane with respect to the beam axis greater than 1 and less than 30 cm, b) all four final state particles within the tracking volume, and correctly identified, c) transverse momentum of the \(\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{S}}^{0}\) greater than 1 GeV/\(c\) and transverse momentum of the \(\psi\) greater than 10 GeV/\(c\), d) angle between the \(\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{S}}^{0}\) and \(\psi\) less than 45\({}^{\circ}\). The lepton identification efficiencies were set to 80%, and the overall track finding efficiency to 95%. The coverage of the tracking volume in pseudorapidity was varied between \(\pm 1.5\) and \(\pm 2.5\).

The reconstruction efficiencies for the case, in which the trigger threshold \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) is 20 GeV/\(c\), are shown in Table 2.

According to the simulation, a mass resolution of 48 MeV/\(c^{2}\) can be obtained for the \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}}^{0}\) meson in the pseudorapidity range of \(\pm 2\). The simulated mass resolution for a \(\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{S}}^{0}\) is 3 MeV/\(c^{2}\), and mass resolution for \(\psi\) is 37 MeV/\(c^{2}\). The reconstructed mass distributions are shown in Fig. 2.

### Background

Background to the signal can be produced by other B-meson decays. B-meson decays with a true \(\psi\) and \(\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{S}}^{0}\) in the final state are \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}}^{0}\rightarrow\psi\mathrm{K}^{*0}\to\psi\mathrm{K}_{ \mathrm{S}}^{0}\pi^{0}\) and \(\mathrm{B}^{+}\to\psi\mathrm{K}^{*+}\rightarrow\phi\mathrm{K}_{ \mathrm{S}}^{0}\pi^{+}\).

The branching ratio \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}}^{0}\rightarrow\psi\mathrm{K}^{*0}\) is \(1.3\times 10^{-3}\), and the total branching ratio \(\mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{b}\rightarrow(\ell^{+}\ell^{-})(\pi^{+}\pi^{-})\pi^{0})\) is equal to \(7.2\times 10^{-6}\), about two thirds of the branching ratio of the signal. The branching ratio of the charged B-meson decay, \(\mathrm{B}^{+}\rightarrow\psi\mathrm{K}^{*+}\), is \(1.4\times 10^{-3}\). and the total branching ratio \(\mathrm{Br}(b\!\!\rightarrow(\ell^{+}\ell^{-})(\pi^{+}\pi^{-})\pi^{+})\) is equal to \(2.0\times 10^{-3}\). about 1.8 times the branching ratio of the signal.

The reconstruction efficiency for these two background channels is similar to the signal because of the genuine \(\psi\) and \(\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm{S}}\) in the final state. These channels, however, involve five particles in the final state, and thus mass resolution is crucial for separating the signal. The reconstructed B-mass for the simulated signal and background are shown in Fig. 3. normalized according to the number of events after all the cuts. The signal is clearly separated from the background.

Hermecity of the detector and B-decay vertex reconstruction precision can further improve the signal to background ratio if the additional pion can be reconstructed. For the charged B-decay this should be relatively easy, whereas it is doubtfull whether a calorimetic measurement of the direction of the \(\pi^{0}\) can provide accurate enough resolution.

The decay modes \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\rightarrow\psi K^{+}\pi^{-}\) (non-resonant) and \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\rightarrow\psi K^{*0}\rightarrow\psi K^{+}\pi^{-}\) (resonant) can also be a source of background, when misidentification of a \(K^{+}\) as a \(\pi^{+}\) produces a fake \(\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm{S}}\). These channels can, however, be effectively rejected by a cut on the minimum flight path of the \(\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm{S}}\), and a cut on the reconstructed \(\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm{S}}\) mass.

The branching ratio \(\mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\rightarrow\psi K^{+}\pi^{-})\) (non-resonant) is \(1.0\times 10^{-3}\), and the total branching ratio \(\mathrm{Br}(b\!\!\rightarrow(\ell^{+}\ell^{-})(K^{+}\pi^{-}))\) is equal to \(4.9\times 10^{-5}\), about 4.5 times the branching ratio of the signal. After selections equal to the signal, the number of background events is 45% of the number of signal events. Requiring the reconstructed \(\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm{S}}\) mass to be within four standard deviations of the nominal value (\(\pm 12\) MeV), the number of remaining background events is 0.4% compared to the number of signal events.

The total branching ratio of \(b\)-decays into a final state \(b\!\!\rightarrow(\ell^{+}\ell^{-})(K^{+}\pi^{-})\), proceeding via the resonant decay channel \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\rightarrow\psi K^{*0}\), is equal to \(4.3\times 10^{-5}\), about 3.9 times the branching ratio of the signal. After the standard selections, the number of background events is 39% of the number of signal events, and the four standard deviation cut on the reconstructed \(\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm{S}}\) mass brings the number of background events down to 1.1% compared to the number of signal events.

The production rates for the different background channels are summarized in Table 3. The rates are calculated by requiring that the trigger muon has \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) greater than 20 GeV/\(c\), and that the muon is within a pseudorapidity range of \(\pm 2\).

Events with \(b\) quarks as a decay product, together with a trigger lepton, can result from \(t\bar{t}\) events and gauge boson pair production. Secondary \(b\)'s do not change the signal to background ratio, since they decay similarly to primary \(b\)'s. They could, however, affect the dilution factor due to different correlations of the lepton charge and the B-meson.

The contribution from boson pair production is negligible. The production cross-sections, normalized to \(b\bar{b}\) cross-section, are [8.9]

\[\sigma(t\bar{t})/\sigma(b\bar{b})=1\times 10^{-5}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline \hline  & \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\rightarrow\psi K^{*0}\rightarrow\psi K^{0}_{\mathrm{S}} \pi^{0}\) & \(\mathrm{B}^{+}\rightarrow\psi K^{*+}\rightarrow\psi K^{0}_{\mathrm{S}}\pi^{+}\) & \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\rightarrow\psi K^{+}\pi^{-}\) & \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\rightarrow\psi K^{*0}\rightarrow\psi K^{+}\pi^{-}\) \\ \hline \(\mathrm{N}_{prod}\) & 7920 & 21670 & 53900 & 47300 \\ \(\epsilon_{rec}\) & 0.10 & 0.10 & 0.0001 & 0.0003 \\ \(\epsilon_{trig}\) & 0.95 & 0.95 & 0.95 & 0.95 \\ \(\mathrm{N}_{rec}\) & 752 & 2059 & 5 & 13 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: The production rates for background channels (per year).

\[\sigma(\mathrm{W^{+}W^{-}})/\sigma(b\bar{b})=5\times 10^{-7},\] \[\sigma(\mathrm{W^{\pm}Z^{0}})/\sigma(b\bar{b})=1.5\times 10^{-7},\] \[\sigma(\mathrm{Z^{0}Z^{0}})/\sigma(b\bar{b})=5\times 10^{-8}.\]

By requiring a triggering muon with a \(p_{T}\) of at least 20 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c\), a relative rate of top pair events versus \(b\bar{b}\) events is \(5.3\times 10^{-3}\). These events add up to the class of wrong tags, since the muon charge follows the charge of the top, and not the \(b\). The contribution is half a per cent increase of the wrong tag events.

Background from accidental correlations of \(\psi\) and \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{S}}\) were shown to be small in dedicated b-experiments [12].

### Dilution effects

The identity of the B-meson is measured from the charge of the muon from the other \(b\)-decay. Dilution effects are produced by a) mistags due to cascade decays of the \(b\), extra \(b\)-pair production from the string, and misidentified muons (\(\pi\), K-decays, punchthrough), and b) \(\mathrm{B^{0}-\bar{B}^{0}}\) oscillation. The dilution is dominated by cascade decays, and oscillation. With a trigger threshold of \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) greater than 20 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c\), without oscillations, the fraction of wrong sign muons \(W=N(\mathrm{wrong\,sign\,muons})/N(\mathrm{all\,muons})\) was found to be 11% due to cascade decays and wrong sign \(b\)-quarks from the string (with a dominant contribution from cascade \(b\to c\rightarrow\mu\) decays).

The rate of hadron decays producing a muon trigger is 1% compared to \(b\)-decays at a trigger threshold of 20 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c\)[10]. Since we are studying only true \(b\)-events with a reconstructed \(\psi\mathrm{K^{0}_{S}}\), we should scale the hadron decay background by a factor of 0.01. which is roughly the ratio between the \(b\bar{b}\) cross section and the total hadronic cross section. This brings the fake muon background at the level of \(10^{-4}\), and thus hadron decays have no effect on the dilution factor. The fraction of punchthrough muons is even lower than muons from hadron decays.

The fraction of wrong sign muons including the \(\mathrm{B^{0}-\bar{B}^{0}}\) oscillation, \(W^{\prime}\), is

\[W^{\prime} = f^{+}\times W+\] \[f^{0}\times(\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\rightarrow\mathrm{B^{0 }_{d}})\times W+\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\rightarrow\mathrm{\bar{B}^{0}_{d }})\times(1-W))+\] \[f^{*}\times 0.5\]

where \(f^{+}\) is the fraction of charged B-mesons, \(f^{0}\) is the fraction of \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\) mesons and \(f^{*}\) is the fraction of \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{s}}\) mesons. The oscillation probability for \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\) is

\[\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\rightarrow\mathrm{\bar{B}^{0}_{d}})=\frac{x^{2} }{2(1+x^{2})}\simeq 0.17.\]

The \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{s}}\) is assumed to have full mixing,

\[\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{B^{0}_{s}}\rightarrow\mathrm{\bar{B}^{0}_{s}})=0.5.\]

The relative fractions were assumed to be \(f^{+}=0.5\), \(f^{0}=0.4\) and \(f^{*}=0.1\). This formulation neglects the contribution of \(b\)-flavoured baryons, which do not mix and hence would contribute similarly to charged \(\mathrm{\bar{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{ \mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{      \mathrm{    }}}}}{}}}{}}{}}{}}{}}{}}{}{}{}}}\). Including the oscillation, the fraction of wrong sign muons is finally \(W^{\prime}=20\%\).

The dilution factor \(D\) without oscillation is

\[D=\frac{N(\mathrm{right\,sign\,\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{ \mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{ \mathrm{\mathrm{ \mathrm{   }}}}}}{}}{}}{}}{}}{}}{}}{}}{}}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}}{ }{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}})-N(\mathrm{wrong\,sign\,muons)}}{N( \mathrm{all\,muons)}}=1-2\times W.\]the fraction of wrong sign muons \(W=0.11\) corresponding to \(D=0.78\). Including the \(\mathrm{B^{0}-\bar{B}^{0}}\) oscillation, the final dilution factor \(D^{\prime}=1-2\times W^{\prime}\) is 0.60.

With a trigger threshold of \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) greater than 12 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c\), the total fraction of wrong sign muons was found to be the same, i.e. 11%, due to cascade decays and wrong sign \(b\)-quarks from the string. Lowering the trigger threshold from 20 to 12 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c\) does not change the fraction of wrong sign muons, however, the composition of the origin of right sign muons is slightly different. With a higher threshold, 99% of the right sign muons come from \(b\)-decays, whereas with a threshold of 12 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c\) the fraction is 95%, and the rest comes from cascade decays \(b\to\tau\to\mu\) and \(c\)-quarks from the string. The fraction of wrong sign muons was found to be 15% for a trigger threshold of \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) greater than 6 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c\).

At a trigger threshold of 12 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c\), the total hadron decay trigger rate is 10% of the rate from \(b\)-decays, giving a fake muon background of \(10^{-3}\), and at a threshold of 6 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c\), the fake muon background is 1%, contributing equally to the right and wrong sign muon classes.

The total dilution factor is thus constant for trigger thresholds \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) down to 12 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c\), i.e. \(D^{\prime}\) is 0.60, and slightly worse at a threshold of 6 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c\), where \(D^{\prime}\) is 0.54.

### Sensitivity on \(\sin 2\beta\)

The error on the \(\sin 2\beta\) is related to \((D^{\prime}\times\frac{x}{1+x^{2}}\times\sqrt{N_{rec}})^{-1}\). With one year of running, one can therefore measure the value of \(\sin 2\beta\) with an accuracy of \(\pm 0.10\) with a tracking coverage of \(\pm 2\) in pseudorapidity, and a muon trigger threshold of \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) greater than 20 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c\). If the threshold is lowered to 12 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c\), then the production rate increases to 77,000 events per year. If one can optimize the reconstruction algorithm for lower trigger thresholds, for example by lowering the \(p_{T}\) cut for the \(\psi\), so that the reconstruction efficiency is the same as in case of the higher trigger threshold (\(\epsilon_{rec}=0.1\), \(\epsilon_{trig}=0.95\)), then the number of reconstructed events would be 7,315. With a dilution factor of 0.60, this gives an error on the \(\sin 2\beta\) equal to \(\pm 0.04\). With the same assumptions, at a trigger threshold of \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) greater than 6 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c\), the sensitivity would be \(\pm 0.02\).

For comparison, the estimated sensitivities in measuring \(\sin 2\beta\) in other experiments are summarized in Table 4. The numbers are scaled for one year of data taking.

## 3 Conclusions

## Appendix A Detector parametrization

The detector modelled in the simulation follows the ATLAS proposal, a general purpose pp collider detector with central solenoidal field for charged particle tracking, high resolution electromagnetic calorimetry for electron identification, and a toroid system for muon identification. The electron momentum measurement is taken from the tracking. The default acceptance of the tracking system is \(\pm 2\) in pseudorapidity, but studies were also performed with different acceptance ranges. \(p_{\mathrm{t}}\) is the transverse momentum versus the beam direction, and \(E_{\mathrm{min}}\) (\(p_{\mathrm{min}}\)) is the detection threshold.

These rails and their supporting structure would extend from the ends of the BACT to the ends of the cavern. They would allow for the elements of the central detector to be lowered from the surface building and then rolled into position. Furthermore, they will allow for the elements of the detector to be rolled back for access once the detector is completed and operational.

**Step 3** The 4 BACT support feet for the cold mass would be lowered and fixed to the floor of the cavern. When this is done the 2 side modules can be lowered into the cavern.

**Step 4** The 2 sides of the BACT would then be assembled in the final position. Each side of the BACT includes a support beam which would rest on the 2 support feet. The bottom module would then be fixed to the 2 side modules.

**Step 5** The top of the BACT would then be lowered and assembled in the final position.

The mechanical assembly of the BACT can be completed after 2 months.

After Step 5 the remainder of the ATLAS assembly can be carried out largely in parallel. This includes:

- The completion of the BACT installation including the welding of the cold ties,

electrical and cryogenic connections, pumping, cool down, cryo and electrical tests.

- The mounting of the Muon chambers

- The installation of the calorimeters

- The installation of the end cap toroids

**Step 6** The barrel calorimeter is either lowered as a complete assembled unit weighing some 2300t or it is assembled underground. The latter scenario has not been studied in detail.

**Step 7** The calorimeter barrel complete with superconducting solenoid would be

rolled to just inside the barrel. The Inner Detector could then be lowered and inserted

within the barrel calorimeter.

**Step 8** The barrel calorimeter is rolled into its final position. Scaffolding would then be

erected and the final connections made. The end cap calorimeters are on the rail system

in an "access" position. This, after either being lowered as complete assembled units,

each weighing some 1000 or being assembled underground.

**Step 9** While work is prcceeding with the calorimeters the muon chamber installation

in the barrel would start.

**Step 10** The EACT's are lowered as complete units onto the rail system either having

been previously tested on the surface or for connection to, and testing by, the definitive

cryogenic system.

**Step 11** The EACT's are rolled into their final position complete with attached muon

chambers. Final connections are made.

**Step 12**: The end wall muon chamber systems would be completed and the forward calorimeters would be lowered as complete units onto their elevator supports. These supports could be operated by remote control.
**The Muon system** would include the support structure and walkways which would be fixed inside the barrel. The support system could allow for the individual muon chambers to be lowered and then slid into position through the open BACT structure. Alternatively, they could be introduced through the sides of the BACT.

The lowering of the muon chambers in large batches could be done using the surface building travelling cranes. For the positioning and fixing of the muon chambers the 2 x 5t crane system will be used. Their installation would proceed in parallel with the other activities from **Step 1 to 12.** For the estimation of the time required to install the muon chambers a total number of 740 has been allowed with 4 chambers being fixed per day.

## Outline time schedule

A summary of the installation schedule is shown in appendix 5 for the hybrid calorimeter scenario. The schedule is based on the PERT diagram in appendix N*6. It shows that 5 3/4 years following T0 the underground installation of the detector can start. The mechanical assembly of the BACT takes about 2 months. After the mechanical assembly of the BACT the remainder of the activities, steps 6 to 12, have an estimated duration of 13 months.

**At this conceptual stage of the project this information can only be considered as a preliminary estimate.** However, the most up-to-date schedules for the BACT from Saclay and the EACT from RAL have been used. While, the installation of the inner detector, calorimeter and the muon chambers are not (yet) based on detailed schedules. It is intended to improve and update these PERT models as more information becomes available.

## Cryogenic requirements

The helium refrigeration plant would need to have a capacity of between 3 and 4kW at 4.5K. This plant would serve the BACT, EACT's and the central solenoid. The compressors would be housed in the same surface building as that required for the LHC machine plant. For the cryogenic tests on the surface the cold box (7m x 2.5m x 4.5m high) would be located close to where the tests are to be performed. Once these tests have been completed the cold box would be lowered underground and installed in the UW cavern. It would be connected to a distribution valve box, also in the UW, from which transfer lines would be taken to serve the BACT, EACT's and solenoid.

## Infrastructure requirements

In addition to the general requirements the following items are particular to the air core toroids:- Cryogenic requirements (see above)

- The rail support system

- The reinforced concrete floor slab should be suitable for the 6000 t load (calorimeter

4000t, the BACT 1000t, the EACT's 500t and 500t for the rail support

system ).

- The permanent aluminium access structure inside the BACT.

- A surface gantry crane of 2 x 165t

- Surface overhead travelling cranes, 2 x 63t for the BACT building

- A surface overhead travelling crane, 1 x 63t for the EACT building

- Two underground travelling cranes, each 5t.

## Conclusions

It has been shown that the underground detector installation time is 15 months. Prior to this a 5 3/4 year period of civil engineering and technical service installation work for the surface and underground areas is needed. The PERT diagrams show that this coincides well with the requirements for the manufacture and surface assembly of the detector components.

It has also been shown that after the 2 months required for the mechanical assembly of the BACT a number of activities can then proceed in parallel while work on the BACT is being completed. The most time consuming single activity in the underground assembly process is the installation of the muon chambers.
