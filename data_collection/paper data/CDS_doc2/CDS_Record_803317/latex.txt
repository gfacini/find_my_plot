**Abstract**

The construction of the ATLAS electromagnetic endcap calorimeter modules is completed. Along the production, three of them were exposed to beam to check the electron response reproducibility and assess the detector response uniformity. Excluding the small crack region around \(\eta=2.5\), studied separately, the response non-uniformity over the whole detector acceptance is around or below 0.6% for the three tested modules. The global constant term of the energy resolution over this large area is around 0.7%, meeting the challenging ATLAS requirements despite the complex geometry of the detector. To achieve this result, corrections for high voltage, leakage and geometrical effects have been parametrized in pseudorapidity over the complete acceptance (\(1.375<\eta<3.2\)). They are reproducible from one module to another and can be used at the ATLAS starting time for all modules.

Introduction

The ATLAS electromagnetic endcap calorimeter (EMEC) consists of two wheels (labelled \(A\) and \(C\)), one on each side of the electromagnetic barrel. Each wheel, divided into eight wedge-shaped modules, covers a pseudorapidity range between 1.375 and 3.2 [1]. Its performance requirements [2] were tuned on few simulated benchmark channels (H\(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\), H\(\rightarrow\) 4\(e\), W', Z') that guided the design choices. Among these requirements, one of the most stringent, in order to control the energy resolution over the wide energy range accessible at the LHC, is to achieve a global constant term of 0.7% or better over the full detector coverage devoted to precision physics (\(|\eta|<2.5\)). The first contribution to this term is a local (over one cell) constant term, mainly related to the intrinsic calorimeter geometry. A second contribution is the non-uniformity of the detector response from cell to cell, arising for instance from mechanical, geometrical, calibration or material effects. To meet the requirements on the global constant term, the response non-uniformity has to be around 0.6% over \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\Phi\sim 0.2\times 0.4\) regions. These regions could then be intercalated using \(Z^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events to obtain the desired accuracy after a few days of data taking at LHC [3].

Performance of the EMEC pre-production module, tested under beam in 1999, have been reported in [4]. A sampling term of the energy resolution between 10% GeV\({}^{1/2}\) and 12.5% GeV\({}^{1/2}\) and a local constant term around 0.3%-0.4% were obtained. As far as uniformity is concerned, no significant results were reported because of problems encountered during the stacking [5, 6]. For the module production, these problems have been overcome by better quality controls, and small design modifications have been introduced.

The construction of EMEC modules was achieved in 2004. Along the three years of production, three modules were exposed to electron beam in the North Area at CERN. The main goals were to check the electron response reproducibility between modules and to control the production quality by measuring the detector response uniformity over its whole acceptance. This is the subject of this note, which is organised as follows. First, the main features of the EMEC modules and of the testbeam facilities are described in section 2. Section 3 explains how the raw signals are reconstructed and calibrated. Then, the uniformity analysis framework is defined in section 4, and corrections to electron energy for high voltage, leakage and geometrical effects are described in section 5. Finally, results on the detector response uniformity and on the global contant term are given in section 6, whereas the crack region around \(\eta=2.5\) is briefly studied in section 7.

## 2 EMEC modules and testbeam facilities

### Generalities

General features of an EMEC module have been described in details in [4], and only those of interest for uniformity purpose are recalled here. The EMEC is divided in one outer (\(1.375<\eta<2.5\)) and one inner (\(2.5<\eta<3.2\)) wheel, both projective in \(\eta\). The crack between the wheels is about 3 mm wide and is mainly filled with low density material. In \(\Phi\), one outer (inner) wheel module is made of 96 (32) accordion shaped absorbers interleaved with readout electrodes, covering a range of \(\Delta\Phi=2\pi/8\).

Accomodating the accordion shape in the endcap region induces a quite complicated geometry. Most of the design parameters vary along the radius direction (corresponding to \(\eta\)) : liquid argon gap, sampling fraction, accordion wave amplitudes or folding angles. A continuously varying high voltage setting along \(\eta\), shown in Figure 1, would partially compensate for this and imply an almost \(\eta\)-independent detector response. However, for technical reasons, the high voltage is set by steps (solid triangles in Figure 1). The outer (inner) wheel is thus divided into seven (two) high voltage sectors. This leaves a residual \(\eta\)-dependence of the response in each sector that must be corrected for.

HV boards distribute the high voltage to \(\Phi\)-sectors of 24 (8) electrodes in the outer (inner) wheel. The two sides of the electrodes are supplied by different HV cables, thus providing a safety margin. The outer (inner) wheel is divided in three (two) compartments in depth, whose granularity is reminded in Table 1. Summing boards, plugged on the electrodes, perform the signal summation in \(\Phi\) : 12 adjacent electrodes are summed for a front cell and 3 (4) for middle and back cells in the outer (inner) wheel. The total number of readout cells amounts to 3888 per module.

### Changes since pre-production module

After the EMEC pre-production module beam test in 1999, small design modifications were introduced. Two of them are of utmost importance for uniformity purpose. First, summing and mother boards1 were redesigned to reduce the inductive crosstalk to an acceptable level (\(<\)1%) [7]. Crosstalk maps of production modules, compared to the pre-production module ones, can be found in [8]. Secondly, a ground connection was added on every electrode connector to obtain a better uniformity of the middle cell inductances along \(\eta\)[4]. Finally, better quality controls were introduced for module production. The cleanliness of the stacking room was improved and the humidity regulated. Honeycomb spacers, which keep the electrodes centred in the gap between the absorbers, were modified in rigid honeycomb nets, facilitating their positionning. They were measured and tested under high voltage before stacking. At last, high voltage tests were performed at the nominal HV settings (Figure 1) after each gap stacking. As a result, very few high voltage problems are detected on production modules.

Footnote 1: Mother boards, plugged on top of the summing boards, ensure the signal routing and the distribution of calibration signals.

### Production modules tested under beam

The sixteen EMEC production modules were stacked in two sites, Madrid and Marseille. Three of them were exposed to electron beam : ECC0 (from Marseille) and ECC1 (from Madrid) in 2001, and ECC5 (from Marseille) in 2002. It can be noticed that ECC0 and ECC1 are the two first stacked modules. As stacking quality improved with time, they present more local defects than the other modules : for instance, about one third (9 over 28) of the whole calorimeter (wheel \(A\) and \(C\)) high voltage problems detected at warm are in these two modules. It is also worth to notice that modules coming from both stacking sites were tested under beam, which is important to check the performance reproducibility.

### Testbeam facilities

EMEC beam tests took place on the H6 line, in the North Area at CERN [4]. In order to study the uniformity of the module response as a function of the electron impact point, the whole detector volume has been scanned using a 119.1 GeV beam, with a negligible momentum spread (\(\sim 0.07\%\)). The beam spot size (\(\sim\pm 2\) cm in both directions) was sufficient to completely cover one middle cell in the outer wheel, but not in the inner wheel. The beam contained also muons, that were vetoed, and \(\sim 10\%\) of pions. Except in the crack region, the latters are tagged and removed from the analysis by scintillator counters located behind the detector. The beam line was also instrumented with four proportional chambers. Cuts are performed on the profile seen by the chamber closest to the calorimeter (\(\sim 0.25\) m), in order to reject events in the beam tails. The chamber efficiency was around 80% (70%) in 2001 (2002). Typically, 70% (60%) of ECC0 and ECC1 (ECC5) events survive the cuts on pion scintillator counters and on beam chamber. As the beam direction was fixed, the module was scanned by moving the cryostat in \(\eta\) and the detector in \(\Phi\), keeping the projectivity. The dead material thickness in front of the active part of the calorimeter (cryostat walls, cold electronics2, cables, liquid argon,...) was almost constant with \(\eta\) and amounted to \(1.5\pm 0.1X_{0}\)[9]. As in ATLAS, a presamplerdevice could be placed in the region \(1.5<\eta<1.8\), in front of the calorimeter. This was the case during the ECC0 test, but the presampler data are not used in the following.

ATLAS-like electronics has been used to read out the signal. Front End Boards (FEBs), housed in crates on top of the cryostat, amplify, shape and store the analog signals coming from the mother boards at a 40 MHz frequency. To cope with the large dynamic range, a three gain shaper is used (ratio 1:9.3:93 called low, medium and high gain), but with the available beam energy, only high and medium gains are relevant3. For each trigger, seven samples for each of the two gains are digitised per channel and sent outside the cryostat. To reduce the noise contribution, a software gain selection is used : the signal amplitude is computed in high gain if its value is below saturation and in medium gain in other cases. Since the beam is asynchronous (unlike ATLAS), the phase between the trigger and the next leading edge of the 40 MHz clock serves as time reference for the digitised samples.

Footnote 3: The low gain is needed for particles with energy typically greater than 300 GeV.

## 3 Electron energy reconstruction

In this section, the treatment applied to raw data to reconstruct and calibrate the electron energy is explained. Data are processed with the EMTB-1-9 package [10].

### Signal reconstruction

For each event, the amplitude and time of the response shape are computed using an optimal filtering (OF) technique [11]. In this method, maximum amplitude (\(A_{max}\)) and peak time deviation from the assumed time (\(\Delta t\)) are linear weighted sums of \(n\) samples \(S_{i}\), in ADC units after pedestal subtraction :

\[A_{max}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}S_{i}\,\quad A_{max}\Delta t=\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_{i}S_{i} \tag{1}\]

Only the five central samples are used (\(n=5\)). The computation of the optimal filtering coefficients \(a_{i}\) and \(b_{i}\) is performed to minimize the noise contribution. This requires for each gain the knowledge of the noise autocorrelation between all samples, extracted from pedestal runs, and of the pulse shape and its derivative. The main difficulty lies in the prediction of the physics pulse shape. This is done through a semi-predictive approach [12], which takes into account that most of the signal readout parts are common to the calibration and physics pulses :

1. The calibration waveform is reconstructed for each channel using special calibration runs (called delay runs), for which calibration boards generate pulses with a fixed amplitude input value and a variable delay time for the pulse start (by steps of 1 ns).
2. From this calibration waveform, the physics pulse is predicted taking into account the two main differences between physics and calibration : the input signal shape is different (triangular for physics and exponential for calibration), and is not injectedat the same point. More precisely, the physics current is generated inside the detector, while the calibration pulse is injected on the mother board, and reaches the inside through an inductive path. This induces a bias in the calibration.
3. The recorded physics pulse shape4 is then fitted with this prediction. From the fit, parameters such as the inductive path difference, the time shift between the two signals and the drift time (as the gap is varying along \(\eta\)) are extracted. Footnote 4: At the beam test, as events are asynchronous with respect to the clock, the physics pulse in a cell can be averaged within a 1 ns bin by using the phase of each event.
4. Finally, the optimal filtering coefficients are computed, incorporating the correction of the bias introduced by the inductive path in the calibration (point 2).

Figure 2 shows that, for a typical middle cell, the physics waveform is predicted to better than 1% over the whole pulse and even better (\(\sim 0.4\%\)) at the peak location. In this example, the calibration amplitude was arbitrarily set to 1. The bias introduced by the different injection points results in a physics pulse amplitude slightly different from 1. This bias is shown as a function of \(\eta\) in Figure 3 for the middle cells of the three tested modules. It roughly decreases with \(\eta\) and is minimal around \(\eta=2.2\), reflecting at first order the cell inductance variation. A good agreement between modules is found.

### Electronics calibration

To correct for the electronics chain variation with time and over all detector cells, calibration runs (called ramp runs) were recorded regularly in high and medium gains. In these runs, calibration boards generate at a fixed start time and in each channel, pulses with linearly increasing input calibration voltages (DAC units). For each DAC value, the cell response amplitude is reconstructed using the pulse shape extracted from the delay runs. The DAC dependence5 is fitted as a function of the amplitude with a second order polynomial. The linear term and the quadratic one, which takes into account small non-linearities, are the gain coefficients of the cell. The closest ramp run preceding the physics run is used whenever possible.

Footnote 5: converted to MeV by applying a global coefficient of 31.3 (39.5) in the outer (inner) wheel.

A few cells (\(\sim\)0.5%, mainly back cells in ECC06) suffered from calibration problems, linked to the mother boards. For these cells, the calibration gain coefficients of the neighbouring cell in \(\Phi\) are used. A specific treatment was needed for ECC5 cells located in the half lower part of one of the three baselines used in testbeam7. This part exhibited in 2002 a large resistive crosstalk affecting the calibration pulses [8]. It has been corrected for in the calibration gain computation by subtracting the neighbouring cell contributions from the calibration shapes. It is worth to notice that the baselines used in testbeam are very different from the gold plated ones that will be used for ATLAS.

Footnote 6: The mother boards used for this module were different from the ones used for the production, explaining these problematic channels. They have been replaced after the beam test.

Footnote 7: It corresponds to the region \(1.6<\eta<2.4\) and \(0.4<\Phi<0.6\). This baseline was already used for the pre-production module beam test in 1999 and suffered probably of ageing effects.

### Clustering

The electron energy is reconstructed by summing the calibrated energies deposited in the three calorimeter compartments. A cluster is built around the cell with the largest energy deposit in the middle compartment. Its size, expressed in number of cells in \(\Delta\eta_{cell}\times\Delta\phi_{cell}\), is \(5\times 5\) (\(3\times 3\)) in the outer (inner) wheel. This is the best compromise between noise and energy leakage. The energies deposited in the \(3\times 5\) (\(3\times 3\)) back cells located behind the middle cluster are then added. In the front compartment, an \(\eta\) cluster size of \(\pm 0.03\) is chosen. As the granularity varies with \(\eta\) (Table 1), the corresponding number of cells changes from 23 to 3. In \(\Phi\), the cluster contains 1 or 2 cells, depending if the shower develops near or far from the cell center. Table 2 summarizes the cluster size in the three compartments. It is similar to the one foreseen for ATLAS [2].

The fraction of the total 119 GeV electron energy contained in the cluster is above 95% at high \(\eta\) and even more at low \(\eta\). At this energy, the longitudinal leakage is negligible. The particle impact position on the calorimeter is estimated with energy weighted barycenters in the front section for \(\eta\) (middle in the inner wheel) and in the middle section for \(\Phi\). It will be used to correct for the energy leakage out of the cluster (section 5.2). The mean energy and the energy resolution are extracted in each run from a Gaussian fit to the total energy distribution. In order to reduce the sensibility to the low energy tails, mainly due to material effects and residual pion contamination, the fit starts at \(-1.5\sigma\) off the mean value.

## 4 Uniformity analysis framework

In this section, the outer and inner wheel regions used for the uniformity analysis are defined and the treatment applied to singular cells is explained.

### Uniformity analysis region

The outer (inner) wheel of one module covers a \(\eta\times\Phi\) region of [1.375-2.5]\(\times\)[0.0-0.8] ([2.5-3.2]\(\times\)[0.0-0.8]) with 44\(\times\)32 (7\(\times\)8) middle cells. They are labelled in \(\eta_{\rm cell}\) from 0 to 43 (44 to 50) and in \(\Phi_{\rm cell}\) from 0 to 31 (0 to 7). For uniformity measurement, cells of the three tested modules were shot by the 119 GeV electron beam. A run of 10 000 events8 was recorded for each cell, except for two small ECC0 and ECC5 zones, due to a lack of time during the beam periods9.

Footnote 8: Half of ECC5 runs contain 20 000 events.

Footnote 9: The first ECC0 (ECC5) zone is at low \(\eta_{\rm cell}\) [6-10], covering the \(\Phi_{\rm cell}\)-range [14-17] ([13-18]). The second one is at large \(\eta_{\rm cell}\) [37-41], covering the \(\Phi_{\rm cell}\)-range [14-17] ([10-18]).

The outer wheel low and high \(\eta\)-regions, defined by \(1.375<\eta<1.5\) (\(0\leq\eta_{\rm cell}\leq 3\)) and \(2.4<\eta<2.5\) (\(40\leq\eta_{\rm cell}\leq 43\)), are not devoted to precision physics in ATLAS : the low \(\eta\)-region will be behind more than 10 \(X_{\emptyset}\) and will mainly recover the energy from the barrel/endcap crack; the high \(\eta\)-region is near the outer/inner wheel crack; both regions do not have a constant depth in \(X_{0}\) and are poorly equiped (no strips and/or no back compartment, see Table 1). They are therefore not included in the present study.

In \(\Phi\), the first of the three electrodes at the position \(\Phi_{\rm cell}=0\) is not present on the tested modules, and is added during their integration in the ATLAS wheel. At the opposite, the gaps at high \(\Phi\) values (mainly outer wheel cells at \(\Phi_{\rm cell}=31\)) are the last stacked. Less load is applied on them, inducing larger gaps with respect to the nominal ones. These border effects in \(\Phi\) are no more present in the ATLAS wheels when all the modules are integrated together. Cells whose cluster includes channels at \(\Phi_{\rm cell}=0\) or 31 are therefore not included in the present study.

To sum up, combining the \(\eta\) and \(\Phi\) border effects (including clustering), the following regions, sketched in Figure 4, are used to analyse the module response uniformity :

* in the outer wheel, \(1.525<\eta<2.4\) and \(0.075<\Phi<0.725\) corresponding to \(5\leq\eta_{\rm cell}\leq 39\) and \(3\leq\Phi_{\rm cell}\leq 28\). It includes 910 middle cells, among which 874 on ECC0, 910 on ECC1 and 844 on ECC5 have been scanned.

* in the inner wheel, \(2.6<\eta<3.1\) and \(0.2<\Phi<0.7\) corresponding to \(45\leq\eta_{\rm cell}\leq 49\) and \(2\leq\Phi_{\rm cell}\leq 6\). It includes 25 cells, all of them have been scanned.

The crack between the two regions around \(\eta=2.5\), corresponding to the crack between outer and inner wheels, is studied in section 7.

### Singular cell treatment

For various reasons, a few % of the cells in the analysis regions exhibit a singular behaviour. We can distinguish the ones linked to problems that occured only during the beam test period, which are removed from the analysis, from the ones that may still be present when ATLAS will take data, which are kept and corrected for.

The first type of cells is related to set-up, data taking problems, or module problems that have been repaired after the beam test :

* Dead cells A few cells were dead (no signal in physics), because of the testbeam set-up or the modules themselves (Table 3). All those coming from the modules have been repaired for ATLAS. Around a dead middle cell, a region of \(3\times 3\) cells is excluded. The 4 middle cells that are in front of a dead strip in \(\Phi\) are excluded. For a dead back cell, nothing is done.
* Connectics problems ECC0 and ECC1 high voltage was uncorrectly cabled in the inner wheel (corrected afterwards). The inner wheel uniformity, as well as the crack between wheels, can therefore only be studied on ECC5. Moreover, in the outer wheel, four (one) electrode front connectors in ECC0 (ECC5) were not plugged on their summing board10. Footnote 10: ECC0 electrodes #41 on summing board F3S2, #60 on F4_S3, #63 on F5_S4, #89 on F5_S3 and ECC5 electrode #84 on F2_S2.

Figure 4: Sketch of the outer and inner wheel uniformity analysis regions for one module. Each full dot corresponds to a run of 10 000 events.

In ECC0, one electrode connector was badly plugged on its HV board11. These errors have been repaired after the beam test. The corresponding cells (\(\sim 20\)) are excluded from the analysis. To avoid such errors, connections of all production modules have been checked by specific measurements. Footnote 11: Electrode #85 on HV sector B4_V2_4.
* Read-out and acquisition problems ECC0 and ECC1 strips in the region \(1.6<\eta<1.7\) and \(0<\Phi<0.4\) were read with a very noisy Front End Board (FEB with FebSpace#29) in medium gain, probably because of a bad ground connection. The related cells are excluded from the analysis. Also because of the FEBs, one ECC0 and one ECC5 cells were dead in medium gain, and are removed from the analysis. For similar reasons, two ECC0 and one ECC1 cells were dead in high gain, but valid in medium gain. This problem has been overcome by analysing the \(3\times 3\) runs around in medium gain only. Finally, a few runs (\(\sim 10\)) have been badly taken by the shift crew and are skipped.

The second type of cells with singular behaviours is related to problems that may still be present in ATLAS :

* High voltage problems Three high voltage sectors were fed on one side only12 because of HV problems at cold. The energy of the corresponding cells is simply multiplied by a factor 2. The energy resolution is degraded by \(\sim 20\%\) in these sectors and by \(\sim 40\%\) at the \(\Phi\)-transition with a good sector. The impact on the response uniformity is negligible. The correction could be refined at the \(\Phi\)-transition with a good sector [13]. Footnote 12: ECC5 HV sector B6_V1_1 and ECC1 HV sectors F_V2_1 and F_V2_2.
* Two ECC1 electrode sides, put on spare lines, were not holding the high voltage13, inducing an energy loss depending on the event impact point position in \(\Phi\) with respect to the faulty electrode (Figure 5). The dependence of the cluster energy with \(\Phi\) is parametrised with a parabola, which is used to correct for the effect. The energy resolution of the affected cells is degraded by \(\sim 50\%\) and the uniformity in the corresponding HV zone (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\Phi\sim 0.2\times 0.4\)) is degraded by \(\sim 20\%\). The correction could be refined by weighting the energies at the cell level instead of the cluster level. Footnote 13: Electrodes #59 on HV sector B5_V2_3 and #07 on B6_V2_1.
* Strange signal waveforms One ECC0 cell (\(\eta_{\rm cell}=36\),\(\Phi_{\rm cell}=5\)) has a strange waveform (slow rising time, low amplitude) linked to a high capacitance on the electrode. This problem is still in the ATLAS wheel. No special treatment has been applied to this cell : its physics

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & Set-up & ECC0 & ECC1 & ECC5 \\ \hline Strips & 5 & 0 & 3 & 1 \\ \hline Middle & 1 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: _Number of dead (no signal in physics) strips and middle cells coming from the testbeam set-up and the modules._and calibration pulses have been used to compute optimal filtering coefficients and calibration gains. In this way, the reconstructed energy (\(118.8\) GeV) and the energy resolution are comparable to standard cells.

Similarly, no special treatment has been applied to the three (only one belongs to the analysis region) ECC0 cells (\(\eta_{\rm cell}=4,\Phi_{\rm cell}=8,9\) and \(\eta_{\rm cell}=5,\Phi_{\rm cell}=9\)) with a strange waveform (slow rising time, high amplitude) linked to a broken ground soldering in the low profile body. This ground problem has been corrected for, as well as those of all production modules. Nevertheless, as the problem might occur at cold in ATLAS, the cell has been kept in the analysis. As three adjacent cells are affected, the reconstructed energy is degraded (\(122.6\) GeV, see Figures 17 and 18). The energy resolution is comparable to standard cells.

To sum-up, only cells related to problems that are specific to the beam test (set-up or module problems corrected afterwards) are excluded from the analysis. All problems that may still be present when ATLAS will take data (high voltage problems, cells with strange waveforms) are kept. The corresponding numbers of cells belonging to the uniformity analysis regions are summarized in Table 4. It can be underlined that, for each module, more than 90% of the scanned cells enter in the analysis.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c||c|} \hline  & \multicolumn{3}{c||}{Outer wheel} & Inner wheel \\ \hline Module & ECC0 & ECC1 & ECC5 & ECC5 \\ \hline scanned & 874 & 910 & 844 & 25 \\ \hline kept & 799 & 840 & 816 & 25 \\  & (91\%) & (92\%) & (97\%) & (100\%) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The result of a parabolic fit, used for correction, is superimposed. \(\Phi\)-modulations (section 5.2.2) are not corrected for._

Electron energy corrections

In this section, the corrections applied on calibrated energies to reconstruct the electron response are explained and parametrised in pseudorapidity over the whole calorimeter acceptance. These corrections are mandatory because of the stepped high voltage setting, the leakage outside the cluster and the accordion geometry. They are performed at the cell level (section 5.1) and then at the cluster level (section 5.2).

### Corrections at cell level

#### 5.1.1 High voltage correction (\(\eta\) non-uniformities)

Because the liquid argon gap thickness is decreasing continuously along \(\eta\) whereas the high voltage is set by steps (Figure 1), the signal response increases linearly with \(\eta\) inside each high voltage sector. This is illustrated in Figure 6, where the seven (two) HV sectors of the outer (inner) wheel are separated with vertical dashed lines. Inside each HV sector, the energy dependence with \(\eta\) deviates from linearity at the borders because of clustering effects. The crack between the two wheels around \(\eta=2.5\) distords the expected linear behaviour in sectors B6 and B7. At this level, the non-uniformity of the response over the analysis region (RMS of the mean energy distribution) is around 4%.

This high voltage effect is corrected for by weighting the energy of each cell, depending on its \(\eta\)-position (taken at its center) and its HV sector (\(l\)), by :

\[E^{cell}_{HV-corr.}(\eta,l)=E^{cell}\cdot\frac{\beta^{l}}{1+\alpha^{l}\cdot( \eta-\eta^{l}_{center})} \tag{2}\]

where \(\eta^{l}_{center}\) is the \(\eta\)-value at the center of HV sector \(l\). The coefficients \(\alpha^{l}\) and \(\beta^{l}\) are the HV correction parameters of sector \(l\), \(\beta^{l}\) being a normalisation factor, close to 1, accounting

The full (empty) dots correspond to cells inside (outside) the analysis region._

for inaccurate high voltage setting. They are determined, starting from Figure 6, by fitting inside each HV sector a linear dependence of the energy with \(\eta\). Because of clustering effects, this is done iteratively and the process converges after 2 or 3 iterations. It has been checked that extracting the parameters by fitting the energy averaged over \(\Phi\) or averaging the parameters obtained on every \(\Phi\)-lines gives the same results. As explained in appendix 1, the inner wheel case is more complicated and the resulting parameters are slightly biased. The results obtained for \(\alpha^{l}\) and \(\beta^{l}\) in the eight scanned HV sectors14 are shown in Figure 7 for the three tested modules.

Footnote 14: The first HV sector, covering the \(\eta\)-range [1.375-1.5], has not been completely scanned (at most 2 cells in \(\eta\)) and is not included in the analysis (see section 4.1).

The agreement between modules is good15, and \(\alpha\) depends very weakly on \(\eta\). Its distribution over all \(\Phi\)-lines of the six outer wheel HV zones is shown in Figure 8. The average value is 0.49, with a dispersion around 10%. This is in agreement with the qualitative expectation, as detailed in appendix 2. In the following, this value (\(\alpha=0.49\)) is used as correction parameter in all outer wheel sectors for the three modules. The normalisation factor \(\beta\) decreases with \(\eta\) and can differ significantly from 1. This suggests to adjust the HV settings shown in Figure 1. For instance, the normalisation factors for B1 and B6 sectors differ by roughly 12%. To correct for this, a compromise could be to increase the B1 high voltage from 2300 to roughly 2500 V and to lower the B6 one from 1000 to roughly 800 V. It is worth to notice that half of this difference (\(\sim\)6%) is hidden if the bias introduced by the inductive path in the calibration (Figure 3) is not corrected for.

Footnote 15: The \(\beta\) value for ECC1 sector B1 is a little bit high because the high voltage was probably uncorrectly set, linked to HV problems.

To conclude, the high voltage correction is reproducible from one module to another. The average parameters over the three tested modules are given in Table 5. \(\alpha\) has been put to its average value (\(\alpha=0.49\)) over all outer wheel HV sectors. This set of parameters is used in the following for the three modules. It can be used at the ATLAS starting time for all modules. The knowledge of these correction parameters will then probably improve with time and data. As an example, the \(\beta\) parameters, which are intercalibration

coefficients between HV regions, will be refined using \(Z^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events [3]. As the mean energy is normalised to the beam energy through the \(\beta\) parameters, no interpretation of the absolute energy scale can be made after the HV correction (which is anyway out of the scope of this note). However, relative differences in the energy scale between modules remain meaningfull.

#### 5.1.2 Capacitance correction (\(\Phi\) non-uniformities)

Along the \(\Phi\) direction, the gap thickness is in principle constant thanks to the honeycomb spacers. However, the energy measured in beam test shows an unexpected non-uniformity along \(\Phi\) almost at the percent level [14]. This effect can be correlated with the middle cell capacitance variation along \(\Phi\)16, as shown in Figure 9 for ECC0. The \(\Phi\)-dependence of the energy can then be explained by local fluctuations of the gap thickness, generated during the module stacking. The effect is almost independent on \(\eta\). Even if it corresponds to small absolute deviations (the gap thickness is roughly 3 mm at low \(\eta\) and 1 mm at high \(\eta\), 1% represents only a few tens of microns), it has to be corrected for to achieve the best response uniformity.

Footnote 16: A global slope is also present on the raw measurements performed at the stacking site. It has been demonstrated [15] that it was due to the stacking frame, and has therefore been removed from the plot to show only the effect coming from the module itself.

\end{table}
Table 5: _Values of high voltage correction parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) for each HV sector averaged over the three tested modules. (* these values are slightly biased, see appendix 1.)_This gave rise to an intensive capacitance measurement campaign. For each module, the most accurate measurements are used. For ten modules (among which ECC0), it corresponds to measurements performed at the middle cell level, on the summing boards, and for one module (ECC5) to measurements performed at the gap level ("capagap" system [16]), on the electrodes. Unfortunately, five modules (among which ECC1) have not been measured. It is possible to compare measurements at stacking sites and on the wheel at CERN for six modules. Both are in good agreement, showing that results do not depend on the module position [17]. The results of these measurements in term of capacitance non-uniformity along \(\Phi\) are summarised in Figure 10. They are used to correct the energy by weighting each cell in the following way :

\[E^{cell}_{capa-corr.}(\Phi)=E^{cell}/\left(\frac{C_{\Phi}}{<C_{\Phi}>}\right)^{\alpha} \tag{3}\]

where \(C_{\Phi}\) is the cell capacitance, \(<C_{\Phi}>\) the average cell capacitance over all \(\Phi\) and \(\alpha\) the high voltage correction parameter (see section 5.1.1). The effect is assumed to be independent on the depth, so that the middle cell measurements are used for all compartments. The power \(\alpha\) express the fact that both high voltage and capacitance corrections take into account the dependence of the energy with the gap thickness, the former along \(\eta\) and the latter along \(\Phi\). It has been checked that this power is near the optimal value giving the best uniformity. Such a correction is not performed in ECC5 inner wheel, whose uniformity along \(\Phi\) is very good. For ECC1, for which no accurate capacitance measurement exists, an ad-hoc correction has been extracted from the \(\Phi\)-dependence of the energy averaged over \(\eta\). As it corrects for local stacking effects, the correction has to be specific for each cell and each module. Starting from the capacitance measurements, it could be refined in ATLAS by intercalibrating \(\Phi\)-slices of the calorimeter with \(Z^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events, in the same way as what is done in [3].

Figure 9: _Variation along the \(\Phi\) direction of the ECC0 outer wheel middle cell capacitance (red triangles) and of the energy measured in beam test (black points). All points have been averaged over \(\eta\)._

### Corrections at cluster level

Due to the limited energy containment of the cluster and the accordion geometry, the measured energy depends on the particle impact point within the cell along \(\eta\) and \(\Phi\). This impact point is estimated by the \(\eta\) and \(\Phi\) energy weighted barycenters defined in section 3.3.

#### 5.2.1 \(\eta\)-leakage correction

In the \(\eta\) direction, the measured energy is maximum for particles hitting the cell center and decreases towards the cell edges due to lateral leakage outside the cluster. This is illustrated in Figure 11 (left) for two cells at different \(\eta\)-values. The leakage is expected to increase with \(\eta\), because of the decreasing cell size in _cm_. It is fitted and corrected for with a parabola :

\[E_{\eta-corr.}(\eta)=E/\left[1+C_{1}(\eta-\eta_{C})^{2}\right] \tag{4}\]

where \(\eta_{C}\) is the most energetic cell center. \(C_{1}\) represents the parabola curvature, directly linked to the amount of leakage. Its average over \(\Phi\) is shown as a function of \(\eta\) in Figure 11 (right) for the three tested modules. As expected, it is negative and decreases along \(\eta\), as the leakage increases. The agreement between modules is good. \(C_{1}\) can be linearly parametrised in \(\eta\), as shown in Figure 11 (right). In the following, the correction is performed in all modules according to this unique parametrisation. The inner wheel case is dicussed in appendix 1.

The dispersion (RMS) is given for each module and for \(A\) and \(C\) wheels. \(\varphi_{\text{cell}}\) is given in official ATLAS numbering (opposite to \(\Phi_{\text{cell}}\) for \(C\)-wheel)._

#### 5.2.2 \(\Phi\)-modulation correction

In the \(\Phi\) direction, the non-containment effect is convoluted with the non-uniformity of the local sampling fraction and electric field, inherent to the accordion geometry. This results in a regular response modulation, whose peak-to-peak amplitude decreases with \(\eta\) between 4% to less than 1%. This is illustrated in Figure 12 for four cells at different \(\eta\)-values. It is fitted and corrected for with the following Fourier series [18] :

\[E_{\Phi-corr.}(\phi_{abs})=E/\left(1+\sum_{i=1}^{2}a_{i}\cos\left[2\pi i(\phi _{abs}-\Delta\phi)\right]+b_{1}\sin\left[2\pi\phi_{abs}\right]\right) \tag{5}\]

where \(\Phi_{abs}\) is in absorber units, \(a_{1}\) and \(a_{2}\) are the even coefficients (it has been checked that only two terms are mandatory), \(b_{1}\) the odd one and \(\Delta\phi\) a phase shift. Fitted coefficients (\(a_{1}\), \(a_{2}\), \(b_{1}\) and \(\Delta\phi\)) are shown as a function of \(\eta\) in Figure 13 for the three tested modules. They have been averaged over \(\Phi\). The agreement between modules is very good for all coefficients, except for \(\Delta\phi\) which accounts for local defects. All coefficients depend smoothly on \(\eta\), reflecting the geometry variation (accordion wave amplitude, folding angle, gap). They can be parametrised along \(\eta\) with simple linear or parabolic functions, as shown in Figure 13. In the following, the \(\Phi\)-modulation correction is performed in all modules according to this simple parametrisation. The inner wheel case is shown in appendix 1.

Figure 11: _(Left) Calorimeter response to 119 GeV electrons as a function of the particle impact point in \(\eta_{\rm cell}\) unit within two different cells (ECC5, \(\Phi_{\rm cell}=6\), \(\eta_{\rm cell}=9\) and \(\eta_{\rm cell}=27\)).

The result of a Fourier series fit is superimposed._

Figure 13: _Coefficients of \(\Phi\)-modulation corrections, averaged over \(\Phi\), as a function of \(\eta\) for the three tested modules. Their linear or parabolic parametrisations are superimposed._

To conclude, the cluster level corrections in \(\eta\) and \(\Phi\) are reproducible from one module to another. They have been parametrized in pseudorapidity over the whole calorimeter. This parametrization is used in the following for the three modules and can be used for all ATLAS modules.

### Energy dependence of the corrections

In summary, the different corrections to reconstruct the electron energy are applied :

* In \(\eta\) at the cell level : the high voltage correction is reproducible from one module to another. Only one parameter \(\alpha=0.49\) can be used for all ATLAS modules, together with nine intercalibration coefficients between HV regions.
* In \(\Phi\) at the cell level : the capacitance correction is specific for each module and is done according to measurements performed on most of the modules.
* In \(\eta\) at the cluster level : the \(\eta\)-leakage correction is reproducible from one module to another and can be parametrised in the outer (inner) wheel with 2 (2) parameters.
* In \(\Phi\) at the cluster level : the \(\Phi\)-modulation correction is reproducible from one module to another and can be parametrised in the outer (inner) wheel with 10 (7) parameters.

Despite the EMEC complicated geometry, and beside the nine intercalibration coefficients between high voltage sectors and the capacitance measurements, only 13 (10) parameters are used to correct the calorimeter response in the whole outer (inner) wheel acceptance17. The four corrections have been determined with 119 GeV electrons. The high voltage and the capacitance corrections are expected to be energy independent. The cluster level corrections (\(\eta\)-leakage and \(\Phi\)-modulations) are expected to vary very weakly with the energy, as the transverse development of electromagnetic showers is energy independent at first order. This has to be extensively studied using simulations, which is out of the scope of this note. The few testbeam data taken at different energies can be used to check these expectations.

Footnote 17: Only the \(\eta\)-range [1.375-1.5] is missing, but the parametrisations can be extrapolated to this region.

Four \(\Phi\)-lines18 have been scanned with 10 GeV electrons in the range \(1.7<\eta<2.3\). The normalised response to 10 and 119 GeV electrons is shown as a function of \(\eta\) in Figure 14 for one line, after applying the same high voltage correction for both energies (Table 5). All residuals are within \(\pm 1\%\). The good correlation between both energy residuals indicates that high voltage correction does not depend on the energy. As a consistency check, fitting the high voltage correction parameters on the 10 GeV data gives an average \(\alpha\) parameter of 0.49, in perfect agreement with the one obtained at 119 GeV.

Footnote 18: \(\Phi_{\rm cell}=7,12\) in ECC0 and \(\Phi_{\rm cell}=9,10\) in ECC5.

A few energy scans, from 10 GeV to 120 or 150 GeV, have been taken at some points. As an example, Figure 15 (left) shows the evolution of the \(\Phi\)-modulations in two cells for electrons of various energies. The results of Fourier series fits are superimposed. The corresponding coefficients \(a_{1}\) and \(a_{2}\) (section 5.2.2) are shown on right plots. Similarly, Figure 16 (left) shows the evolution of the \(\eta\)-leakage in one cell for electrons of various energies.

The results of parabolic fits are superimposed, and the corresponding parabola curvature \(C_{1}\) (section 5.2.1) is shown on the right plot. The longitudinal position of the maximum energy deposit depends on the energy as \(\log(\mathrm{E})\). Low energy particles (\(\mathrm{E}\leq 20\) GeV) do not enter deeply enough in the calorimeter to create significant \(\Phi\)-modulations and \(\eta\)-leakage. At higher energies, both effects are almost energy independent, as expected. However, the gap thickness varies with depth and this variation is more pronounced at low \(\eta\) values. This may explain the weak dependence of \(\Phi\)-modulation coefficients with the energy at low \(\eta\) (Figure 15, top right panel).

The conclusion is that the four corrections depend very weakly or not at all on the energy, in the range accessible during beam tests (\(\mathrm{E}\leq 150\) GeV). This has to be confirmed and extended to higher energies with simulations.

Results

In this section, the results obtained on the detector response uniformity, the energy resolution and the global constant term are presented.

### Uniformity

The mean reconstructed energy after all corrections is shown as a function of \(\eta\) in Figure 17 for all the cells kept in the analysis and for the three tested modules (outer wheel). The corresponding distributions are shown in Figure 18. Their dispersion (RMS/Mean) is the non-uniformity of the module response over the whole outer wheel analysis region. It is around or below 0.6% for all modules. It is slightly better for ECC1 because an ad-hoc capacitance correction has been used. Relative differences in the energy scale between modules are quite low (below 0.5%), but are not easily interpreted. A similar result is obtained for ECC5 inner wheel : the response non-uniformity over the 25 cells is around 0.6% (upper estimate, see appendix 1).

It is worth to remind that non-uniformity is around 4% before any correction is applied. The high voltage correction lowers this number below 1% (0.78% for ECC0, 0.86% for ECC1 and 0.65% for ECC5) and the capacitance correction gives the final results. An independent analysis performed by the UAM (Madrid) group [19] reached similar conclusions. Cluster level corrections do not impact the module response uniformity, but improve the energy resolution and the constant term (section 6.2). The problematic channels (high voltage failures in ECC1 and ECC5, strange signal waveforms in ECC0), that have been kept (section 4.2), do not degrade the results : if they are excluded, the non-uniformity value is lowered by less than 0.01%. It can also be noticed that incorporating the correction of the bias introduced by the inductive path in the calibration (section 3.1) improves the uniformity by more than 20%. All the results are summarised in Table 6. They meet the ATLAS requirements.

As already outlined, the high voltage regions will be intercalibrated in ATLAS using \(Z^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events (what is done in this analysis with the \(\beta\) factors). A 0.3% precision could be achieved within two or three days [3]. It is therefore interesting to look at the response uniformity in each of these zones. Results are shown in Table 7 for the three tested modules. As expected, the border regions (B1, B6) exhibit a slightly larger non-uniformity compared to the central ones. The results are around or below 0.6% for all the regions of the three modules19.

### Energy resolution

The energy resolution, including noise and beam spread, is shown as a function of \(\eta\) in Figure 19 for the three tested modules (outer wheel). It has been averaged over \(\Phi\). It lies between 0.95% and 1.3% in the whole analysis region, except for the two extreme points. It is minimum around \(\eta=1.85\), which corresponds to the region where the sampling fraction is still high (\(\sim\)15%) and the \(\Phi\)-modulation amplitude already low (\(\sim\)1%). Subtracting quadratically the noise term contribution (\(\sim\) 200 MeV/119 GeV\(\sim\)0.17%) and the beam spread (\(\sim\) 0.07%), results are compatible with those reported for the pre-production module [4] : a sampling term between 10% GeV\({}^{1/2}\) and 12.5% GeV\({}^{1/2}\), depending on \(\eta\), and a local constant term between 0.3% and 0.4%. The average sampling term over the whole \(\eta\)-range can be extracted by subtracting quadratically an average local constant term of 0.35% : a value of 11.4% GeV\({}^{1/2}\) is found, with an error estimated below 0.3% GeV\({}^{1/2}\). This result is in very good agreement with the average sampling term extracted from a parabolic fit on the pre-production module results as a function of \(\eta\) (Figure 24 of [4]) : a value of 11.4% GeV\({}^{1/2}\) is also found.

The agreement between modules is quite good. The resolution is in average slightly better for ECC5, compared to ECC0 and especially to ECC1. This may come from the better uniformity of its gap thickness in \(\Phi\) : the capacitance measurements correct for this effect in average, but may leave some fluctuations. The resolution is better for ECC0 at low \(\eta\) because the beam was narrower, so only the central part of the cells was hit. It is worse for ECC5 (ECC1) in the region \(\eta>2.3\) (\(\eta>2.1\)) because of high voltage problems in one sector (two electrodes) (see section 4.2).

The influence of the cluster level corrections is illustrated in Figure 20, where the energy resolution in one \(\Phi\)-line is shown as a function of \(\eta\) before and after these corrections are applied. Corrections improve the energy resolution by 10% to 30%, depending on \(\eta\). It is a compromise between the \(\eta\)-leakage, which increases with \(\eta\), and the \(\Phi\)-modulation amplitude, which decreases with \(\eta\). In the inner wheel, the resolution is worse for cells at \(\eta_{\rm cell}=46\) and \(\eta_{\rm cell}=48\) due to extra material in front of the calorimeter (see appendix 1).

### Global constant term

The global constant term of the energy resolution can be estimated from the overall energy spectrum of all electrons collected in the cells of the analysis region. This spectrum is shown in Figure 21 for the three tested modules (outer wheel). About 5.5 millions20 events enter in each plot. The low-energy tail is mainly due to material effects and residual pion contamination. The constant term is estimated from a Gaussian fit to the spectrum over the region not affected by the tail (starting at \(-1.5\sigma\) off the mean value), after unfolding the average sampling term (11.4\(\pm\)0.3% GeV\({}^{1/2}\), see section 6.2), the noise term contribution (200 MeV/119 GeV\(\sim\)0.17%) and the beam momentum spread (\(\sim 0.07\%\)). The resulting global constant term is around or below 0.7% for all modules. The uncertainty on the sampling term, which still dominates the energy resolution at 119 GeV, induces an error on the result around \(\pm 0.03\%\). If the fit region is extended down to \(-2\sigma\), the resulting constant term is increased by less than 0.02%. The total error on the results can therefore be estimated to be less than \(\pm 0.04\%\). The same analysis has been performed on ECC5 inner wheel, with an average sampling term of 10.6% GeV\({}^{1/2}\) and a noise term contribution of 0.18%. The result is around 0.78%, which can be considered as an upper estimate (see appendix 1). All these results are summarised in Table 8. They meet the ATLAS requirements. As expected, they are consistent with the quadratic sum of the local constant term (\(\sim\)0.3-0.4% [4]) and of the detector response non-uniformity (\(\sim\)0.6%), obtained in section 6.1.

Footnote 20: It corresponds to \(\sim\) 7000 events (70%*10000, section 2.4) collected in each of the \(\sim\) 800 cells of the analysis region for each module. For ECC5, half of runs have double statistics (20 000 events), and the corresponding events have been weighted with a factor 0.5, in order to give the same weight to each cell.

The result is better for ECC5, because of its slightly better energy resolution (Figure 19). The problematic channels (high voltage failures in ECC1 and ECC5, strange signal waveforms in ECC0) that have been kept (section 4.2) weakly impact the results : if they are excluded, the global constant terms are lowered by less than 0.02%.

Results from the three modules have been combined, without any energy scale normalisation between modules : Figure 22 shows the sum of the three histograms from Figure 21. It represents the overall energy spectrum of all electrons collected in the 2455 cells of the three modules kept in the analysis, representing an area of \(\sim\) 3 m\({}^{2}\). More than 16 millions events enter in this plot. In the same way as previously for each module, the global constant term over this large area can be estimated from a gaussian fit starting at \(-1.5\sigma\) off the mean value. A value of 0.70% is found, consistent with the results obtained for each module (Table 8). If the fit region is extended down to \(-2\sigma\), the result goes to 0.72%.

## 7 Study of the crack region

The crack region between outer and inner wheels was scanned in ECC5 at fixed \(\Phi\) (\(\Phi=0.55\)), in the range \(2.44<\eta<2.56\). A total of 12 runs of 20 000 events were taken each \(\Delta\eta=0.01\). The interleave (3 mm) between the two wheels is filled with the G10 transverse bars of the inner wheel absorbers, which represents around \(3X_{0}\) in depth, to be compared to 36 \(X_{0}\) in the outer wheel (at \(\eta=2.49\)) and 26 \(X_{0}\) in the inner wheel (at \(\eta=2.51\)). It should be noticed that inner and outer wheel electrodes are not coppered on the last 2 mm near \(\eta=2.5\) for technical reasons, which affects the charge collection in this region.

For this study, in order to be mainly sensitive to the crack effect, a constant cluster including cells of both wheels is chosen for the energy reconstruction. Its size in the middle compartment is \(\Delta\eta_{\rm cell}\times\Delta\phi_{\rm cell}=4\times 5\) in the outer wheel and \(2\times 3\) in the inner wheel. One of the main problem for this analysis is the separation between electrons and pions around \(\eta=2.5\) : as electrons still have most of their energy after passing through the calorimeter, the scintillator counters can not be used to tag pions. Therefore, no cut is applied and the study is affected by remaining pions, lowering the mean reconstructed energy. Figure 23 shows the total energy as a function of \(\eta\)-barycenter. Between the inner and outer wheel, the electron energy is affected only in a small zone of about 10 mm, where up to 60% of the total energy is lost. This is in good agreement with the study performed on the pre-production module [4].

The vertical dashed lines correspond to the separation between middle cells and the full line at \(\eta=2.5\) separates the outer and the inner wheel. The mean energy is lower than the beam energy (119 GeV) because of pion contamination._Conclusions

The uniformity of the electromagnetic endcap calorimeter response to a 119 GeV electron beam has been studied on three production modules. Corrections for high voltage, leakage and geometrical effects are applied on calibrated energies at the cell and at the cluster level. High voltage and cluster level corrections are reproducible from one module to another. They are parametrised as a function of \(\eta\) over the complete detector acceptance (\(1.375<\eta<3.2\)). One parameter only is used for high voltage corrections, together with the nine intercalibration coefficients between the high voltage sectors, that will be refined in ATLAS using \(Z^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events. For the cluster level corrections, 12 (9) parameters are used in the outer (inner) wheel. These parametrisations can be used at the ATLAS starting time for all modules.

An unexpected non-uniformity along \(\Phi\), almost at the percent level, has been linked to liquid argon gap thickness non-uniformities. Specific capacitance measurements have been performed on most of the modules and are used to correct for this effect. Specific treatments devoted to problematic channels (high voltage failures, strange signal waveforms) have also been determined.

Excluding the small crack region around \(\eta=2.5\), the response non-uniformity is around or below 0.6% over the three module outer wheels (\(1.5<\eta<2.4\)) and over the tested inner wheel (\(2.6<\eta<3.1\)). The resulting global constant term of the energy resolution is around 0.7% in each case. Combining results from the three modules, without any energy scale normalisation between modules, a global constant term of \(0.70\pm 0.04\%\) is measured over an area of about 3 m\({}^{2}\) containing 2455 cells. This result meet the challenging ATLAS requirements despite the complex geometry of the detector.

## Appendix 1: Inner wheel specificities

Compared to the outer wheel analysis, the inner wheel uniformity study is much more simpler as it includes 25 cells only. However, the extraction of the corrections, and more particularly the high voltage one, is more tricky and caution has to be taken when extrapolating the results to ATLAS. This is mainly due to _i)_ small high voltage sectors located near borders (crack at \(\eta=2.5\), module end at \(\eta=3.2\), clustering effect at \(\eta=2.8\)), as seen in Figure 6. Therefore, HV correction parameters are determined using only two points in sector B7 and three in B8. _ii)_ one point of each sector (\(\eta_{\rm cell}=46\) in B7 and \(\eta_{\rm cell}=48\) in B8) suffers from extra material in front of the calorimeter, due to the testbeam cryostat21. This will not be the case in ATLAS. This extra material lowers the energy of the corresponding cells, biases the HV parameter determination and degrades the response uniformity, the energy resolution and the global constant term. Therefore, the results obtained for the inner wheel concerning uniformity, energy resolution and global constant term are upper limit estimates of the intrinsic inner wheel performance.

Footnote 21: This extra material comes from G10 cones, which strengthens the cryostat cdd wall.

The large size in \(\eta\) of inner wheel cells biases the barycenter computation, degrading the expected parabola shapes for the \(\eta\)-leakage. Moreover, the extra material in front of \(\eta_{\rm cell}=46\) and \(\eta_{\rm cell}=48\) distords theses shapes. Coefficient \(C_{1}\) for \(\eta\)-leakage has nevertheless been linearly parametrised in \(\eta\). Fitted coefficients of \(\Phi\)-modulation corrections (\(a_{1}\), \(a_{2}\), \(b_{1}\) and \(\Delta\phi\)) are shown as a function of \(\eta\) in Figure 24. They have been averaged over \(\Phi\). They can be parametrised in \(\eta\) with simple linear or parabolic functions.

## Appendix 2: Signal variation with gap thickness

The calorimeter response \(E\) can be written as :

\[E\sim\frac{f_{\mathit{samp}}}{g}E_{\mathit{field}}^{b}\sim\frac{f_{\mathit{samp}} }{g^{1+b}}U^{b} \tag{6}\]

where \(g\) is the liquid argon gap thickness, \(f_{\mathit{samp}}\) the sampling fraction, \(E_{\mathit{field}}\) the electric field in the gap, \(U\) the high voltage value and \(b\) a constant parameter.

Inside each HV sector, the high voltage is constant (\(\Delta U=0\)), whereas the gap thickness is varying continuously along \(\eta\) in the simple following way at first order :

\[\frac{\Delta g}{g}\sim-\Delta\eta \tag{7}\]

Moreover, a simple calculation [20] shows that :

\[\frac{\Delta f_{\mathit{samp}}}{f_{\mathit{samp}}}\sim(1-f_{\mathit{samp}}) \ \frac{\Delta g}{g}\sim(-1+f_{\mathit{samp}})\ \Delta\eta \tag{8}\]

Starting from equation (6) and injecting (7) and (8), the energy variation inside each HV sector can be written at first order as :

\[\frac{\Delta E}{E}\sim\frac{\Delta f_{\mathit{samp}}}{f_{\mathit{samp}}}-(1+b )\ \frac{\Delta g}{g}\sim(b+f_{\mathit{samp}})\ \Delta\eta \tag{9}\]

Comparing this expression with the high voltage effect correction (equation 2 in section 5.1.1), we get \(\alpha\sim(b+f_{\mathit{samp}})\) : the \(b\) parameter has been measured around \(0.3\)[20] and more recently \(0.39\)[4, 14]; the sampling fraction \(f_{\mathit{samp}}\) is between \(0.1\) and \(0.2\) in the endcap electromagnetic calorimeter. Summing these two terms gives a signal sensitivity to the gap variation of \(\alpha\sim 0.4-0.6\), which is in good agreement with what is found in this note. This crude calculation does not take into account effects such as the energy sharing between cells or the signal readout (shaping).
