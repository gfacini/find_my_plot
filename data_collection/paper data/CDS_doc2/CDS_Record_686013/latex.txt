Figure 14: Profiles of the X-ray beam in the vertical direction (broad component of them). In this direction, the exit slit has a size of 22 mm. The left-hands plots correspond to a measurement close to the exit slit, and the right-hand plots to a measurements at a distance 500 mm from it. The top (respectively bottom) plots corresponds to the BDD position before (respectively after) rotation by 180\({}^{o}\) around the \(g_{\varphi}\) axis.

The left-hand plots correspond to the wire placed close to the exit slit of the X-ray beam, and the right-hand plots to the wire placed at a distance of \(\sim 500\) mm. The top (respectively bottom) plots correspond to the BDD position before (respectively after) rotation by \(1\,80^{o}\) around the \(g_{\varphi}\) axis.
