# ATLAS NOTE

**ATLAS tunes of Pythia 6 and Pythia 8 for MC11**

The ATLAS Collaboration

We present the latest developments of the ATLAS MC generator tuning project for the Pythia family of event generators, including the C++ Pythia 8 code for the first time.

The Pythia 6 tunes presented here, titled AMBT2B and AUET2B and constructed for a variety of PDFs, constitute alternatives to the AMBT2/AUET2 tunes previously presented as a candidate for the ATLAS MC11 event simulation campaign. They systematically differ from the AMBT2/AUET2 Pythia 6 tunes in the treatment of \(\alpha_{S}\) in the parton shower, to address concerns with those tunes. Systematic tune variations are also presented.

The Pythia 8 tunes have been constructed for two different PDFs, and are primarily aimed at an optimal description of minimum bias, for use in pile-up simulation. PDF-sensitive effects are observed and discussed in the MPI tunings of both generators.

## Introduction

In a previous note [1], we presented new tunes of the Pythia 6[2] and Herwig/Jimmy[3, 4] event generators using ATLAS analysis data from the 2010 data-taking period, including for the first time a complete tune of Pythia's modelling including hadronisation, final-state showering and fragmentation, initial state parton cascades, and multiple parton interaction (MPI) modelling, also including non-ATLAS data where possible. These tunes were named AMBT2 (Pythia only) and AUET2 (for Pythia and Herwig/Jimmy) depending on whether minimum bias or underlying event data was used in the MPI stage of the tuning. We refer to them collectively in this note as "A\(*\)T2".

In this note we describe an extension of this tuning study for the ATLAS MC11 simulation campaign, designed to address shortcomings in the Pythia tunes noted in the previous note and now including first ATLAS tunes of the new Pythia 8[5] generator. The Pythia 6 changes are primarily driven by concerns with the parton shower configuration used in the A\(*\)T2 tunes and by a desire to construct equivalent and systematic variation tunes for a variety of parton density functions (PDFs).

While conducting the tunings described in this note it was observed that several undesirable features in the A\(*\)T2 Pythia 6 MPI tunes, whose origin had been hypothesised to be driven by the shower configuration used in those tunes, were in fact determined by the PDF used in the tuning. These artifacts, seen particularly in minimum bias \(p_{\perp}\) spectra and the shape of underlying event \(p_{\perp}^{\text{lead}}\) profile observables, were found to be unresponsive to MPI parameter changes, and are described and investigated in the last section of this note, for both Pythia 6 and Pythia 8.

MC-adapted PDFs [6, 7, 8] are a relatively new concept which provide PDFs especially designed for LO generators. The idea is to obtain the behaviour of an LO PDF - in particular the LO gluon distribution - in the phase space relevant for the soft QCD models, while at the same time modifying the high-\(x\) PDFs such that the predictions of the LO MC generator for hard processes closely resemble the full NLO predictions, i.e. using NLO PDFs in NLO ME calculations. ATLAS was the first experiment to use these "mLO" PDFs in MC production campaigns. It has been shown by comparison to Tevatron data [9] that there is no final answer yet as to which PDFs give the best results. PDF effects on MC model predictions are difficult to obtain unless the PDF-dependent model parameters are tuned to the data. This note presents comparisons of full tunes to a variety of both MC-adapted and LO PDFs to LHC data to further check this approach to PDF construction.

As for the A*T2 tunings, all tuning was performed using the Rivet 1.5.0 [10] analysis toolkit and the Professor 1.2.1 [11] MC tuning system.

## 1 Pythia 6

The AMBT2 and AUET2 tunes of Pythia 6 described in a previous note [1] were based upon the parton shower configuration used by the "Perugia 2010" (P2010) [12] tune set, on the grounds that P2010 had placed special emphasis on a shower tuning to improve the description of transverse jet shapes as measured by the CDF experiment, a task which we wished to repeat using ATLAS jet shape measurements. In particular, P2010 set the \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}\) values for the initial state shower and MPI to the value specified by the PDF, and an extra scale enhancement factor inspired by studies of higher-order effects [13] was applied.

All these aspects of the A*T2 tunes are reasonable, while still stopping some distance short of a fully consistent \(\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}\) treatment between the various simulation components. However, as the A*T2 tuning process came to an end, several observations raised concerns about the suitability of this configuration:

* equivalent to those for the CTEQ5L leading order PDF
- were being used for all PDFs. This explained the observation that varying between PDFs with very different \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}\) values did not significantly change Pythia 6 jet shape predictions. Explicitly setting the \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}\) to match the PDF had very large effects on the MPI parameters.
* Perugia 2010 and AUET2 were both found to give an "anomalous" fixed-order-to-hadronised scale-factor for the \(R_{32}\) 3-jet to 2-jet ratio [15] in ATLAS studies, when compared with all other event generators and Pythia AMBT1.
* Reconstruction-level ATLAS MC truth studies seemed to indicate that missing \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) was being poorly modelled by P2010 in MC09, and the shower configuration was suspected to be responsible.
* In the AMBT2 tune, an irreducible overshoot was seen in the ATLAS minimum bias \(p_{\perp}\) spectra, and in AUET2 the UE profile observables of transverse activity against lead-track \(p_{\perp}\) were found to have an anomalous shape. These features were thought to be related to the shower configuration.

Due to these concerns, a rapid re-tuning program was started, with the intention to provide a single alternative pair of Pythia 6 tunes for MC11 simulation, in which the parton shower setup would be returned to an AMBT1-like configuration, with the \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}\) values set explicitly to the CTEQ5L value of 0.192 and no CMW scale enhancement factor. As \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}\) for the LO* and LO** PDFs is very different from the default (CTEQ5L) value, the \(\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}\) values in this tune differ significantly between the different parts of the shower. The shower setup primarily differs from AMBT1 in that 5 flavour rather than 4 flavour evolution of \(\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}\) is used in all the tunes presented here; 5 flavour evolution is always used in the FSR, so this setting yields a consistent flavour treatment for \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}\) in the different parts of the shower code.

As for the AUET2 Herwig/Jimmy tune, the tunes presented here (titled AMBT2B and AUET2B, as they are based on virtually the same data as the A*T2 tunes) have been constructed with equal fitting weights for several different PDFs. Several intriguing PDF-dependent features are discussed in Section 3. In all these tunes, the \(e^{+}e^{-}\)-tuned hadronisation and final state shower parameters from A*T2 are used. The tuning is hence split into two stages: a 3-parameter shower tune and a 5-parameter MPI tune, described in the following sections. The fit weights used are almost identical to those from A*T2, and hence the differencesin tune values and behaviour may be attributed to the different shower configuration, the reduced number of tuning parameters and the variety of PDFs.

Since the observables for shower tuning - in particular the jet shapes - are also sensitive to the MPI tuning, initial MPI configurations from similar PDFs were used to give a reasonable MPI description for the shower tuning. An iterative procedure was applied for the LO** PDF, for which there was no suitable existing MPI configuration: the underlying event observables were tuned first using the MPI parameters, then the shower tune was performed, and then another MPI tune. Since sufficiently good UE agreement was already reached for all observables after the shower tune, a second MPI tune was not required for the other PDFs.

### Shower tune

In order to minimise the difference to AMBT1 and to significantly reduce the number of MC production runs necessary for the interpolation in the tuning procedure, the 5-parameter tune was reduced to 3 parameters by setting the maximally allowed virtuality enhancement for ISR emissions (Pythia parameter PARP(67)) to 1, as a low value was favoured in the ATLAS dijet study [16]1) and the "intrinsic \(k_{T}\)" Gaussian smearing width (Pythia parameter PARP(91)) was set to 2.0 GeV, which gives a reasonable agreement with Tevatron Z \(p_{\perp}\) data reported in [17]. The Professor tuning method requires MC-generated data from a sufficient number of input parameter points to construct the parameterisation from which the optimal tuning is generated: for the shower stage, 100 parameter points were run for each PDF and cubic parameterisations were used, giving a conservative oversampling factor of 5.

Footnote 1): The AUET2 tune favoured an even lower value of \(\sim\) 0.65, but 1.0 was the lowest value studied in the dijet paper.

The observables and weights, mostly as for A*T2, are shown in Table 1, and the resulting tune parameters are presented in Table 2. Notable features are the higher value of the ISR cutoff scale, PARP(62), for the mLO PDFs than for the LO ones, and that the MSTW2008LO PDF is unusual in preferring an _increase_ in \(\alpha_{S}\) evaluation scale (PARP(64) \(>\) 1) whereas all other PDFs prefer a reduced scale. The FSR \(\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}\) scale, PARP(72), is slightly higher for the LO PDFs than for the mLO ones. The behaviours of the tunes in ATLAS jet observables are shown in Figures 1-2.

### MPI tune

The multiple parton interactions and their modelling in Pythia 6 and our tuning strategy have been discussed in [1], so we just list briefly the parameters used in this tuning:

* The \(p_{\perp}\) cutoff/regulariser value used to avoid soft divergences in the model, set for a reference scale of \(\sqrt{s}=\) 1800 GeV, and the exponent used in its energy evolution to other beam energies are given by PARP(82) and PARP(90) respectively.
* The hadronic matter distribution is modelled by a double-Gaussian distribution, parameterised by PARP(83) and PARP(84): as these parameters are strongly correlated, we fixed PARP(83) to its AMBT1 value of 0.356 and only tuned PARP(84).
* The final parameters are PARP(77) and PARP(78), which control the probabilities of colour reconnection occurring for fast-moving (high-\(p_{\perp}\)) and general colour strings.

The main difference to the previous round of tuning is purely logistical, in that several UE runs where kinematic coverage was previously obtained by use of \(\hat{p}_{\perp}\) "slices" were converted to use single "enhanced sampling" runs. This improved the generation speed and efficiency by reducing each parameter sampling run from \(\sim\) 30 jobs to 10. All runs were processed using the LHC Computing Grid.

Each \(x,Q\) combination is a different colour, with solid dots for the AUET2B parameters and hollow dots for AMBT2B parameters. Notable features include the distinct MB and UE (vertical) groupings of the PARP\((78)\) and PARP\((84)\) parameters, and the correlation of PARP\((82)\) values with the values of the low-\(x\) gluon PDFs. It can also be clearly seen that the minimum bias tunes prefer slightly higher values of PARP\((82)\) (and hence less MPI activity) than in the corresponding UE tunes, but this effect is small compared to that due to the variation between PDFs. With the exception of the low-\(xf(x)\)-valued MSTW2008LO PDF, the PARP\((84)\) matter distribution parameter also appears to be correlated with the gluon \(xf(x)\) values.

and UE tunes.

The results show a strong differentiation between the tunes to LO and mLO PDFs, which is discussed in more detail in Section 3. The LO** PDF arguably has the worst behaviour for minimum bias observables, with a very substantial overshoot in the description of charged multiplicity from \(N_{\mathrm{ch}}\gtrsim 40\) for a track \(p_{\perp}\) cut of 500 MeV. All the mLO PDFs display a factor-of-2 overshoot in the minimum bias \(p_{\perp}\) spectra for much of the available range, an observable well described for both LO PDFs. These excesses are less pronounced for a track \(p_{\perp}\) cut of 100 MeV - indeed the MB charged multiplicity is described _better_ by the mLO PDFs than by the LO ones! The underlying event observables are also in general described better by the LO PDFs, with the two MRST mLO PDFs (LO* and LO**) undershooting the turn-over region - this is discussed in more detail in Section 3.

### Systematic variation tunes

Many physics analysis studies require estimates of systematic uncertainties in MC modelling, via variation tunings constructed to capture a particular effect or set of effects. The Professor MC tuning system provides several mechanisms for estimating systematic errors in MC tunes, the most convenient of which is the "eigentunes" approach. This construction is based on deviations from a central tune along orthogonal directions in the parameter space which are aligned with the principle axes of the \(\chi^{2}\) covariance matrix at the central tune point, such that the same increase in \(\chi^{2}\) is obtained for each deviation. As deviations are possible in both positive and negative directions along each principle axis, a \(p\)-parameter tune stage will in general generate \(2p\) eigentunes for each central tune.

We use the eigentune mechanism to construct variation tunes for the MPI tuning stage, around the AUET2B LO** tune only. The reason for this restriction is that this is the main production tune for Pythia 6 in ATLAS MC11 and hence its MPI variations provide systematic variations in the underlying event simulation for many signal processes. Eigentune sets for other tunes described in this note may be provided on demand by the ATLAS MC tuning group. While eigentunes eliminate some of the arbitrariness in the choice of systematic variation tunes, the magnitude of the change in \(\chi^{2}\) remains semi-arbitrary. We have chosen to use the default \(\Delta\chi^{2}=1\) deviation, inspired by the analogy with such a variation corresponding to a 68% confidence variation in a truly \(\chi^{2}\)-distributed test statistic. It should be noted that the "\(\chi^{2}\)" measure used by Professor includes tuning weights and reference data errors, and is hence not formally distributed this way, but in practice this construction produces an acceptable level of variation on the UE distributions.

In general, there should be 10 UE eigentunes in this study, as we simultaneously tuned 5 parameters in the Pythia 6 MPI model. Indeed, we provide 10 such variations, listed in Table 4. However, there are cases such as top and \(b\)-physics where the same colour reconnection (CR) mechanism as we have tuned to optimise MPI data description has profound implications for the hard scattering: these analyses treat colour reconnection systematics in detail and separately from UE systematics. For these analyses, we have extended the Professor eigentune mechanism to respect the fixing of a subset of \(n\) tune parameters to the central tune value, and hence to construct the eigentune variations solely from the \(p-n\) remaining free parameters. As there are two CR parameters among the five parameters in our MPI tuning, we also construct 6 "no-CR" eigentunes for AUET2B LO**, tabulated in Table 5, and 4 "CR-only" eigentunes shown in Table 6. This feature will be released for general use in Professor version 1.3.0, or from revision 1292 of the development version onwards. The behaviours of the 3- and 5-parameter eigentunes on ATLAS UE observables are shown in Figures 8 and 9.

Pythia 8

The use of the C++ Pythia 8 generator is gaining more popularity, partly because this is the version being supported and developed by the authors, and partly because it has better diffractive modelling than Pythia 6[22]. So far in ATLAS, tune 4C [23] with the leading order CTEQ6L1 PDF has been used. The Pythia 8 tuning effort in ATLAS started with the aim of getting a good description of ATLAS minimum bias data, for an optimal description of ATLAS pile-up, including improved diffraction. However, parallel studies to also understand the effect of different PDFs on Pythia 8 tuning have been performed.

The tuning procedure, using Rivet and Professor is very similar to the Pythia 6 tuning efforts described before in this note and in ref. [1]. Since this was the very first Pythia 8 tuning within ATLAS, we started with only tuning the MPI parameters; these are described in Table 7, which also shows the tune 4C values and corresponding Pythia6 parameters for easy reference.

The tuning strategy employed was to tune only to published ATLAS \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV minimum bias (MB) and leading track underlying event (UE) data, since it has already been seen that tuning to LHC and Tevatron data with three different centre-of-mass energies is very challenging. We started with the tune 4C parameters, and tuned only the parameters mentioned before. Table 8 shows the observables tuned to, with the corresponding tune weights. More weight was put on 7 TeV distributions, and on distributions with \(p_{\perp}\geq 0.5\) GeV.

The tuning was done separately for two different PDFs, CTEQ6L1 (LO) and MRST LO** (mLO). It was found that with the LO PDF, a common tune (named A1) for minimum bias and underlying event could be obtained, with slightly better description of ATLAS minimum bias data at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV compared to the tune 4C. For higher order PDFs, this was not the case, and separate minimum bias (AM1) and underlying event (AU1) tunes were needed. Table 9 shows the tune parameters for all the tunes.

Table 9 clearly shows that the different PDFs prefer particular values of the tuning parameters. For the LO PDF, the MB \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions and MB and UE \(\langle p_{\mathrm{T}}\rangle\) vs \(N_{\mathrm{ch}}\) correlation demanded lower colour reconnection (CR) strength, as seen for Pythia 6, while MB and UE multiplicity spectra demanded stronger CR. We have used the lower CR value, since for pileup simulation the MB \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum is the most important distribution, This tune is reasonably close to tune 4C, except that we use a double-Gaussian matter distribution. In the AMBT1 Pythia6 tuning, use of the double-Gaussian form was seen to improve the description of multiplicity distribution tails, although no strong distinction is observed in this study.

For the LO** PDF, both tunes require a very low CR value, MB data prefers a lower CR value than UE data does, and the UE tune prefers a significantly higher energy evolution exponent. When comparing the tune parameters for all three PDFs, a few interesting features are also observed:

* LO** is within 10% on \(N_{\mathrm{ch}}\) but more than 50% off in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectra. The same effect was seen in Pythia 6 tuning, and is discussed further in Section 3.
* For the MB tunes, LO preferred values of CR strength and MPI \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cutoff is lower than the LO** values, while the energy exponent is much higher for LO**. However, for UE tunes, the LO and LO** CR values are rather close. Both demand very similar energy exponent, but the MPI \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cutoff increases from LO to LO**.
* Substantial variations are seen in the matter distribution parameters between the LO** MB and UE tunes, reminiscent of the Pythia6 tuning results discussed earlier. It is hard to draw exact parallels in this study, due to the difference in number of PDFs tuned, and the use of two rather than one double-Gaussian parameter in the Pythia 8 case, but the tension between MB and UE data description is evident. The option of an \(x\)-dependent proton size has been implemented in Pythia 8[27] as an attempt to resolve this tension, and will be investigated in future tuning studies.

Figure 12: Comparison plots of the new Pythia 8 MB tunes to ATLAS underlying event data at 7 TeV.

Figure 10 shows the new LO and LO** MB tunes (and tune 4C), compared with ATLAS minimum bias data at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. The LO tune represents a slight improvement over tune 4C for the relevant distributions, while the LO** tunes are the first Pythia 8 tunes using these PDF. Figure 11 shows the transverse region ATLAS underlying event plots at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV compared with the new tunes for both the PDFs, and again with tune 4C. The LO** tune looks the best, but the LO tune performs as well as tune 4C. Finally, Figures 12 compares the new MB tunes with the same UE data: clearly the LO** MB tune completely fail to describe the data. In fact attempts at a combined minimum bias and underlying event tune with this PDF did not improve the situation, and conversely UE tunes with mLO PDF did not describe the minimum-bias data at all.

_Technical notes:_ The Pythia 8 version used was 8.150, with the PDFs taken from LHAPDF version 2.5.0 [14]. For LO, no difference was observed with using the Pythia-provided internal PDF set. Soft-QCD events were generated with single and double diffraction turned on, with particles having \(c\tau>10\) mm kept stable.

## 3 PDF sensitivity in MPI tuning

The tunings presented in this note, for both the Pythia 6 and Pythia 8 generators, have indicated a significant connection between the PDF being used and both the parameter values obtained and some qualitative features of MPI-influenced observables.

The relationship between PDF groupings (LO, mLO, and NLO) was already observed for the simpler Jimmy MPI model in the A*T2 tunings [1], and a similar effect is seen for the Pythia model. In particular, as for the Jimmy many-PDF study, the size of the \(p_{\perp}^{0}\) MPI cutoff is ordered according to the typical value of the gluon PDF at low values of Bjorken \(x\), with mLO PDFs favouring the highest values of \(p_{\perp}^{0}\). Scatter plots of Pythia 6 parameters against the low-\(x\) gluon PDF values are shown in Figure 3.

A more surprising observation is that mLO PDFs, which were designed with intentions to produce LO-like simulation behaviours at low-\(x\), and NLO-like behaviours at high-\(x\), lead to several anomalous features in MPI-dominated distributions. The most obvious of these is seen in the minimum bias charged particle \(p_{\perp}\) spectrum, as in Figure 4, where the LO PDFs manage to describe the data reasonably well, but the mLO PDFs all produce a large overshoot of the data starting at \(\sim 10\) GeV. This apparently harder spectrum of MPI emissions is also seen in the underlying event observables of Figures 6 and 7, particularly the standard deviation profile plot in which mLO PDFs are seen to have a wider (i.e. harder) \(p_{\perp}\) spectrum than the LO PDFs in each \(p_{\perp}^{\rm lead}\) bin. The hardness of these \(p_{\perp}\) spectra was found to be unaffected by any changes in MPI parameters.

Another effect of mLO PDFs was seen in the shapes of UE profile plots. These are typically described in terms of a "ramp" region, where transverse event activity grows linearly with hard-process scale before turning over into a "plateau" region as the transverse proton overlap saturates. The plateau is typically flat for the \(N_{\rm ch}\) observables, and has a slight slope in the \(p_{\perp}^{\rm sum}\) observables, due to the influence of shower emissions (which scale with the hard process) on the transverse regions. UE tunes made using LO PDFs were able to match both the shapes of the ramp and plateau regions, and to provide a reasonable description of the turn-over region between them. mLO tunes, by contrast, tend to develop a steeper \(p_{\perp}^{\rm sum}\) plateau slope than seen in data if the entire \(p_{\perp}^{\rm lead}\) range is tuned to: this was the motivation for restricting the UE tunings to the plateau region for AUET2 and in these tunes. The AUET2 tune, and the mLO tunes shown in this note all undershoot the turn-over region and diverge from the LO tunes in the ramp region, indicating again that the simulation of minimum bias is significantly affected by this type of PDF. LO PDFs give a description of the UE profiles which works well for the full range of \(p_{\perp}^{\rm lead}\). It is not known whether these PDF effects are driven by parton shower or MPI behaviours.

Summary

In this note we have presented new tunes of the Pythia 6 and Pythia 8 event generators, using very similar datasets to those described in the A\(*\)T2 tuning note [1]. The motivations for tuning these two generators were respectively concerns about some unexpected behaviours of the AUET2 and Perugia 2010 parton shower configurations, and growing interest in using Pythia 8 (which features an improved diffraction model) as the main ATLAS generator for pile-up simulation. For the Pythia 6 A\(*\)T2B tunings presented here, a shower configuration similar to the ATLAS MC10 AMBT1 tuning has been used, with separate shower and MPI tunings for five different PDFs. In this study, LO and mLO PDFs have been considered: an extension to NLO PDFs will be performed.

Tuning sensitivities to the PDFs used, both expected and unexpected, have been noted: the main conclusion is that LO PDFs provide a better quality of simulation of minimum bias and underlying event observables than is possible when using mLO PDFs. mLO PDFs show several anomalous features, and in particular for purely minimum bias or underlying event studies there is little motivation, either theoretical or practical, for their use.

Of the non-mLO tunes presented here, AMBT2B CTEQ6L1 produces a particularly good description of minimum bias observables, and is thus particularly recommended for purely minimum bias simulation. The newer leading order PDF tuned to here, MSTW200LO, does not describe MB/UE processes quite as well as the CTEQ PDF, at least within the Pythia MPI model.

The decision of which tune to recommend is more complex for UE tunes, as MPI features are not the main reason to choose a particular tune: the main deciding factor is the quality of the simulation of the hard process. The LO** PDF remains the baseline production PDF for ATLAS leading-order generators in the MC11 simulation campaign, based on its desirable features as shown in the papers which introduced it [7]. The AUET2B LO** tune does provide a reasonable description of ATLAS UE activity and as such is recommended as the main ATLAS production tune of Pythia 6 for MC11. For studies which are particularly interested in UE effects, the AUET2B CTEQ6L1 tune, and the variety of MPI eigentunes presented in this note, will be of particular interest.

Given the unexpected features of mLO PDFs identified in this note, it seems relevant to suggest that the performance of mLO PDFs on high-\(p_{\perp}\) signal processes be reviewed for future productions. The results of this study may have relevance for tuning of MPI models implemented in other MC generators, such as Herwig++ and Sherpa.
