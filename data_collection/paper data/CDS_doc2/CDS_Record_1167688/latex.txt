**Abstract**

The ability to trigger on \(b\)-jets improves the flexibility and physics performance of the High Level Trigger (HLT), especially for topologies containing more than one \(b\)-jet. It will be shown that the acceptance for \(b\)-jets can be increased and background reduced by lowering jet transverse energy thresholds and applying \(b\)-tagging selections based on the impact parameter of tracks in jets. This note reviews the \(b\)-jet selection in the HLT and discusses its integration into the ATLAS trigger menu.

Introduction

Final states containing \(b\)-jets have been proposed as signatures with substantial discovery potential in a variety of physics channels. The ability to separate \(b\)-jets from light-quark and gluon jets is thus an important ingredient of the online selection strategy in ATLAS.

One of the most interesting physics cases addressed by such a \(b\)-jet trigger selection involves events with final states containing four \(b\)-jets. This event class is relevant for Higgs bosons search in the low mass range, \(m_{H}<130\text{ GeV}\). The most promising channels are the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) decay, where the Standard Model Higgs boson is produced by way of the associated production channel \(t\bar{t}H\) and, in supersymmetric theories, the channels \(b\bar{b}H\), \(b\bar{b}A\) with \(H/A\to b\bar{b}\) or \(H\to hh\to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\).

The selection of \(b\)-jets at the trigger level is mainly meant to improve the flexibility of the HLT, extending its physics performance for the topologies described above. This is achieved by increasing the acceptance for signal events, while concurrently reducing the background.

The \(b\)-jet selection relies on tracking information which is only available starting with the Second Level Trigger (L2). Therefore, the acceptance for signal can only be increased by simultaneously lowering L1 jet thresholds and applying a more discriminating \(b\)-jet selection in the High Level Trigger (L2 and EF). High rejection power from the \(b\)-jet trigger is required to compensate for less rejection due to lower L1 thresholds and thereby to comply with L2 and EF output rate limitations.

## 2 Monte Carlo samples

The \(b\)-tagging performance on single jets, presented in this note, is evaluated on \(b\)-jets from \(H\to b\bar{b}\) decays, where the Higgs boson has a mass of 120 GeV and is produced in association with a \(W\) decaying leptonically. The standard background for single-jet studies are the corresponding \(u\)-jets, obtained by artificially replacing the \(b\)-quarks from the Higgs decay with \(u\)-quarks. While these events imprecisely model the real background from light-flavour jets they can be seen as a worst case scenario since the kinematical properties of signal and background are very similar.

Even in this very simple situation, the association between Regions of Interest (RoI), identified by the L1 trigger, and jets is not uniquely defined: a generic \(x\)-quark in the final state of an interaction or a decay can radiate gluons and, therefore, change its direction. An RoI from \(H\to b\bar{b}\) or \(H\to u\bar{u}\) is labeled as \(x\)-jet (\(x=b,u\)) if an \(x\)-quark from the original hard process points, after final state radiation, along the RoI direction within an angular distance of \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}<0.1\).

In order to evaluate the rate of the \(b\)-jet trigger menu, the rejection power must be evaluated on a more representative background sample. As for many of the trigger studies in ATLAS, dijet samples are chosen for this purpose since they correctly include all contributions to the \(b\)-tagging background, including \(c\)-quarks and taus.

All data samples studied in this note have been generated without pile-up, leaving the influence of pile-up for further studies. The activity due to underlying event is taken into account since it is automatically included in the pythia[1] event generation.

## 3 HLT \(b\)-jet selection

### L1 configuration

The HLT reconstruction starts from the RoIs selected by the L1 trigger [2]. In particular, the \(b\)-jet trigger starts from a L1 jet-RoI \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.8\times 0.8\) and performs track and vertex reconstruction in a smaller RoI \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.4\times 0.4\) in order to reduce data access and consequently processing time.

### \(b\)-jet trigger feature extraction algorithms

The first step in the \(b\)-jet trigger chain, both at L2 and EF, is the reconstruction of the relevant quantities needed to perform the selection. The \(b\)-jet RoIs can be separated from light jet RoIs using the impact parameters of the charged tracks, the properties of reconstructed secondary vertices, or soft leptons; all these quantities are related to the \(b\)-quark lifetime and to its decay properties.

The present \(b\)-jet trigger implementation relies only on the impact parameters of charged tracks. Primary vertex reconstruction is performed only in the \(z\) direction while its coordinates in the transverse plane are assumed to be compatible with the origin.

Track reconstruction algorithms are described, together with their performance, in [3]. The two Inner Detector tracking algorithms available at L2 show equivalent performance when operating on jet samples [3]. Thus to avoid unnecessary comparisons, the results obtained with the SiTrack algorithm are presented. For EF track reconstruction, the algorithm corresponding to that used for offline reconstruction has been adopted (NewTracking).

#### 3.2.1 Primary vertex reconstruction

Along the \(z\) direction no _a priori_ knowledge of primary vertex \(z_{\it trx}\) is available; consequently, this has to be reconstructed, starting from the tracks available in the RoI. This information is needed for the correct evaluation of the longitudinal parameter of each track with respect to the primary interaction position.

The adopted algorithm, a simple histogramming method based on a sliding window, yields an efficiency of 98(99)% and a resolution on \(z_{\it trx}\) of about \(120(100)\mu\)m at L2(EF) as illustrated in Fig. 1.

### Tagging variables

The HLT \(b\)-jet tagging methods are based on the transverse and longitudinal impact parameters of the reconstructed tracks. Since the methods are the same for L2 and EF they will be described using L2 variables only.

Figure 1: The distribution of the difference between the true and the reconstructed \(z\) primary vertex coordinates at L2 (full line) and EF (dashed line). The widths as determined by a fit to the distributions are 120 \(\mu\)m and 100 \(\mu\)m, respectively.

#### 3.3.1 Transverse impact parameter

The most natural choice is to build the \(b\)-tagging discriminant variable from the transverse impact parameter \(d_{0}\) of the reconstructed tracks. Since the hadrons containing \(b\)-quarks have a finite lifetime (\(\tau\sim~{}1.6\) ps), tracks from their decays are characterized by large \(d_{0}\) values, while tracks from \(u\)-jets come dominantly from the primary vertex (\(d_{\rm{vtx}}=0\)).

In particular, the significance of the transverse impact parameter \(S=d_{0}/\sigma(d_{0})\) is used, where \(\sigma(d_{0})\) is the error on the impact parameter. The error on the transverse impact parameter at L2 is parametrized as a function of reconstructed \(p_{T}\)as:

\[\sigma(d_{0})=\sqrt{p_{0}^{2}+\left(\frac{p_{1}}{p_{T}}\right)^{p_{2}}}\]

where \(p_{0}\) is the asymptotic term, \(p_{1}\) is the term due to multiple scattering, and \(p_{2}\) is the exponent of the multiple scattering contribution (close to two). Although L2 tracking algorithms have recently reached a good level of precision, the above error parametrization is still applicable at L2 during early data, while for the EF the reconstructed error is used.

Figure 2 shows the distributions of the impact parameter significance \(d_{0}/\sigma(d_{0})\) for \(b\)-jets and light jets at L2. The significance has been rescaled according to the function \(f(x)=log(1+|x|)\) in order to have a reasonably uniform bin population along the \(x\) axis. From these plots it can be guessed that the impact parameter significance is a promising choice for the discriminant variable, since the two distribution are very well separated.

#### 3.3.2 Longitudinal impact parameter

The longitudinal impact parameter (\(z_{0}\)), i.e. the track's z-intercept, can be adopted, as well as the transverse impact parameter, to discriminate between \(b\)-jets and light jets. After the primary vertex position has been reconstructed, the \(\delta z_{0}=z_{0}-z_{\rm{vtx}}\) variable can be used to form a discriminant which can then be used for \(b\)-jet selection. Figure 3 shows the distributions of the longitudinal impact parameter significance (\(\delta z_{0}/\sigma(z_{0})\)) of \(b\)-jets and light jets at L2. The significance has been rescaled as described above for the transverse impact parameter.

As for Fig. 2, the signal and background distributions are different although much less so than for the transverse impact parameter significance. From this comparison, it is clear that most of the discrimination will be provided by the measured transverse impact parameter significance. The resolution of the longitudinal impact parameter significance is not as good due to the coarser resolution of the silicon tracking detectors along the \(z\)-direction, bigger extrapolation distance from innermost silicon layer hit to primary vertex at high \(\eta\), and to the resolution of the reconstructed primary vertex.

### HLT \(b\)-jet tagging methods

In this Section, HLT \(b\)-tagging methods are described. The likelihood ratio method is quite general and can be applied to different variables while the \(\chi^{2}\) method is essentially designed to test the compatibility of the tracks with respect to the primary vertex using the transverse impact parameter.

The likelihood ratio, using information on the signal and background shape that have to be estimated on real data, is both more powerful and more difficult to tune than the \(\chi^{2}\) method.

#### 3.4.1 The likelihood-ratio method

The likelihood-ratio method is a statistical tool used to separate two or more event classes, and is based on a set of characteristic variables. The likelihood-ratio variable \(W\) is evaluated, for a given event, as the ratio between the probability distributions for two alternative hypotheses. In its application to \(b\)-jet selection, the likelihood-ratio variable is defined as

\[W=S(s)/S(b),\]

where \(S(s)\) and \(S(b)\) are the probability densities for the signal, the \(b\)-jets, and the background, represented in this case by the \(u\)-jets. This variable is widely used to obtain the best possible separation between signal and background, in terms of a single variable, in fits aimed at extracting the fraction of signal events in a given sample. The same variable can be also directly used, as in the \(b\)-jet selection case, to select signal events, for example by applying a cut on the likelihood-ratio variable itself.

The probability density distributions used in the \(b\)-tagging application can be functions of some parameter of each track (e.g. the transverse impact parameter \(d_{0}\)) or of some collective property of the jet (e.g. its track multiplicity). In the first case, these distributions take the form

\[s(par_{1},par_{2},par_{3},\ldots,par_{n}),\] \[b(par_{1},par_{2},par_{3},\ldots,par_{n}),\]

where the \(1,\ldots,n\) indices identify each track belonging to the jet. The corresponding likelihood-ratio variable is thus defined as

\[W=\frac{s(par_{1},par_{2},par_{3},\ldots,par_{n})}{b(par_{1},par_{2},par_{3}, \ldots,par_{n})}\]

Exact evaluation of the \(s\) and \(b\) functions is very difficult, since it would require an almost infinite amount of simulated data; for example, in order to reasonably populate an \(n\)-dimensional cube, about 100 entries are needed for each dimension, corresponding to \(n^{100}\) tracks; even worse, the number of tracks in a jet is not fixed. However, if we assume that the variables corresponding to different tracks are independent, the ratio between the overall probability densities reduces to the product of the ratios of the single probability densities:

\[W=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\frac{s(par_{i})}{b(par_{i})},\]

which is much easier to evaluate. In the \(b\)-tagging case, track parameters have complex correlations which depend on the proper time for the \(B\) hadron and on its decay kinematics. Nevertheless, it can be proven that, neglecting these correlations does not invalidate this variable, but results only in a slight reduction of its discriminating power.

The \(W\) variable, can take any value between 0 (for the background) and \(+\infty\) (for the signal). For practical reasons, it is useful to handle a variable defined on a finite interval; to achieve this, \(W\) is usually replaced by another variable

\[X=\frac{W}{1+W},\]

which can only range between 0 and 1.

As an illustration of the method, Fig. 5 and Fig. 5 show the distributions of the discriminant variable \(X\) which is based on the combination of the transverse and longitudinal impact parameter for \(b\)-jets and light jets respectively at L2 and EF. It can be seen that signal events (\(b\)-jets) accumulate near \(X=1\), while the background (light jets) tends to have \(X\) close to 0.

Contrary to the offline \(b\)-tagging methods based on likelihood ratio, the sign of the impact parameters is currently not used at HLT since the RoI direction does not give a precise estimation of the \(b\)-jet direction. Future studies will use the impact parameter sign determination respect to a track based cone jet described in the next Section.

#### 3.4.2 \(\chi^{2}\) method

The \(\chi^{2}\) method offers an alternative tagging approach that is more robust since it is less dependent on the details of the impact parameter distributions. This method has been studied and characterized only at L2.

The \(\chi^{2}\) method computes the probability for a jet to originate from the primary vertex, based on the _signed_ transverse impact parameter significance of tracks pointing to the jet. This technique was originally developed by the ALEPH collaboration and extensively used at LEP and Tevatron experiments [6][7][8]. One of the main advantages of this method is that it only relies on the transverse impact parameter significance distribution of prompt tracks in multi-jet events, which can be easily derived completely from real data. On the other hand the performance of this method is limited due to the fact that tracks from beauty and charm particles produce significant tails with negative impact parameters. These negative tails originate from the differences of the direction of the estimated jet and \(B\)-hadrons and also in the differences of the direction of \(B\)-hadrons and charmed hadrons in the cascade decays.

The definition of the sign of the transverse impact parameter is based on the angle between the jet axis and the line between the primary vertex and the point of closest approach of the track, such that it is negative when the track appears to originate behind the primary vertex (i.e. when the angle is greater than \(\pi/2\)) as illustrated in Fig. 6.

Tracks from light-quark jets have equal probability to have positive or negative transverse impact parameters, and the width of the signed transverse impact parameter distribution depends on the tracking detector resolution and multiple-scattering effects. The signed transverse impact parameter distribution of tracks from displaced \(b\)-jets, on the other hand, has a large positive asymmetry due to the fact all that most of the long-lived particles from \(b\)-hadron decays are produced with positive impact parameters.

Good jet angular resolution is a key to achieving a good \(b\)/light-quark jet discrimination since the direction of the jet axis enters into the calculation of the sign of the impact parameter. Poor jet angular resolution results in frequent mis-assignment, particularly for tracks with small angle with respect to the jet direction.

In order to improve the resolution of the azimuthal angle (\(\phi\)) of the jet, a track-based simple cone jet reconstruction algorithm is used instead of the jet-RoI \(\phi\) direction. Figure 7 shows that the \(\phi\) resolution improves by more than a factor of two when tracks are used to compute the jet direction. The effect of jet \(\phi\) resolution on \(b\)/light quark jet discrimination can be seen in Fig. 8, which shows the distribution of signed transverse impact parameter significance for \(b\)-jet tracks when \(\phi\) is computed using truth, RoI, and track-jet \(\phi\) directions.

The negative transverse impact parameter significance is computed using a parameterization for the transverse impact parameter error as a function of \(p_{scat}=p\sin\theta^{3/2}\) and the number of hits in the pixel detector. A double-Gaussian fit to the distribution of negative transverse impact parameter significance (\(R(S)\)) is used to define \(p_{trk}(S)\), the probability for a track to originate from a primary vertex:

\[p_{trk}(S)=\frac{\int_{-15}^{-|S|}R(S)dS}{\int_{-15}^{0}R(S)dS} \tag{1}\]

where only tracks with positive impact parameter are used in the calculation. The distribution of negative transverse impact parameter significance and the resolution function \(R(S)\) is shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 for tracks with less and more than 7 Silicon detectors hits.

The definition of \(p_{trk}\) ensures a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 for tracks originating from the primary vertex. Tracks from displaced \(B\) decays result in \(p_{trk}\sim 0\).

A \(\chi^{2}\) jet probability is defined by considering the probabilities of all tracks with positive transverse impact parameter in a jet [6]:

Figure 6: Definition of the sign of the transverse impact parameter. When the angle between the jet axis and the line between the primary vertex and the point of closest approach of the track is lower (greater) than \(\pi/2\) the sign is positive (negative).

\[p_{jet}=\Pi\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\frac{(-\log\Pi)^{j}}{j!} \tag{2}\]

where \(\Pi=\prod_{1}^{N}p_{trk}(S)\).

Figure 11 shows the \(p_{trk}\) distribution for light and \(b\)-quark jets. The spike at small probability for light quarks tracks is due to tracks from \(V^{0}\) decays, which have positive transverse impact parameter.

Figure 12 shows the \(p_{jet}\) distribution for light and \(b\)-quark jets. Jets are tagged as \(b\), if the \(p_{jet}\) is below some value, typically between 0.5% and 5%.

## 4 HLT \(b\)-jet selection performance on single jet-RoIs

Every tagging method will be characterized by the curve showing the light-jet rejection versus the efficiency to select \(b\)-jets (\(\epsilon_{b}\)). The light-jet rejection is defined as the inverse of the efficiency of selecting \(u\)-jets (\(R_{u}=1/\epsilon_{u}\)) where we have assumed that u-jets are representative of light jets in general.

### Likelihood ratio method using impact parameters

Figures 14 and 14 show, respectively, the \(b\)-tagging performance for L2 and EF when the transverse impact parameter significance is used in defining the discriminant variable \(X\), while figures 14 and 14 show the \(b\)-tagging performance curves for L2 and EF, when the significance of the longitudinal impact parameter with respect to the primary vertex is used instead.

Figures 18 and 18 show the \(b\)-tagging performance curves for L2 and EF when the likelihood ratio method is built on the combination of the transverse and longitudinal impact parameter significances.

### \(\chi^{2}\) method

The performance of the \(\chi^{2}\)\(b\)-tagging algorithm, evaluated as a function of the \(\chi^{2}\) cut is shown in Fig. 19. The limited efficiency of the method is due to the request of at least two reconstructed tracks to define the track-jet. Clearly, an effort should be made to include RoIs having only a single track. Nonetheless, we note that the strength of the method lies in its impact intrinsic robustness and this advantage must also be considered when comparing its performance with that of the likelihood method.

### Comparison with the offline selection

To tune the online working points so as to ensure the attainment of the overall (i.e. including offline cuts) efficiency goal of 60% for \(b\)-jet tagging and avoid biases, it is crucial to evaluate the correlation between the online and offline algorithms.

The performance of the L2 and EF trigger algorithms based on impact parameters in the transverse plane has been compared to that obtained with the corresponding offline algorithm. This choice is motivated by the wish to perform a coherent comparison; more exhaustive comparison studies will be performed on specific physics selections.

Figure 20 demonstrates that the L2, EF and Offline selections are well correlated. In particular it is always possible to recover the full offline performance at a given \(b\)-jet efficiency if the L2 and EF workingpoints are set at an appropriate higher efficiency. In particular for the trigger menu studies shown in the following, a working point of about 80% efficiency at L2 and about 70% at EF have been chosen in order to ensure full acceptance for the standard offline working point (60%).

Future studies will address remaining differences between EF and offline algorithms.

### Execution time at L2 and EF

The execution time needed to reconstruct relevant quantities described in this note and to perform \(b\)-jet selection was evaluated both at L2 and EF. Results highlight that the timing performance fits design requirements and that the overall time spent is dominated by data preparation and track reconstruction algorithms. Further details are given in [3].

## 5 \(b\)-tagging trigger strategy

After having defined and characterized the \(b\)-jet selection algorithm on single \(b\)-jet RoIs the \(b\)-jet trigger menu has to be built. Figure 21 illustrates the online \(b\)-jet selection algorithm's performance as evaluated using high statistics samples. The performance of the L2 algorithm is indicated along with the performance of the EF algorithm on events which are selected by L2 (at the nominal working point of 80% efficiency).

Since the \(b\)-tagging cut is fixed, the \(b\)-tagging efficiencies vary with \(E_{T}\)threshold. Typical L2(EF) \(b\)-tagging efficiencies are \(\epsilon_{b}=76(67)\%\) at \(E_{T}\)= 18 \(GeV\) and \(\epsilon_{b}=80(73)\%\) at \(E_{T}\)= 70 \(GeV\). This variation of the working point as a function of \(E_{T}\)compensates for the effect of the worsening of the \(b\)-tagging performance at low \(E_{T}\), so the rate reduction does not change significantly with \(E_{T}\).

It is clear that \(b\)-jet selection can play an important role especially for events with multiple \(b\)-jets because the selective filtering of \(b\)-jets can produce very high rejection and thereby allow a significant decrease of the L1 thresholds while keeping the jet-RoI output rate of L2 and EF almost constant.

Figure 19: Performance of the \(b\)-tagging selection based on the jet \(\chi^{2}\) probability variable.

### \(b\)-jet trigger menu

The possible \(b\)-jet signatures initiated by multi-jet L1 signatures with given \(E_{T}\)thresholds can be represented in general as **nb\(E_{T}\)_mL1J\(E_{T}\)**, where n indicates the number of \(b\)-tagged jets required out of m L1 jets with transverse energy greater than \(E_{T}\). The HLT \(b\)-tagging working point is the one describe in section 4.3. The rate reduction as a function of the available L1 thresholds is shown in Fig. 22. The EF output rates of different multi \(b\)-jet signatures at the luminosity of \(10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) are given in Table 1. The rates and uncertainties of these rates have been computed for dijet samples using the relations

\[\begin{array}{l}p_{i}=N_{EF}^{i}/N_{Total}^{i}\\ R=\mathcal{L}\sum p_{i}\sigma_{i}\\ \sigma(R)=\mathcal{L}\sqrt{\sum\frac{p_{i}(1-p_{i})}{N_{Total}^{i}}\sigma_{i} ^{2}}\end{array} \tag{3}\]

where \(N_{EF}^{i}\) and \(N_{Total}^{i}\) are respectively the number of events selected at the end of the trigger chain and the total number of events in the sample \(J_{i}\), \(\sigma_{i}\) is the cross-section of the sample \(J_{i}\) and \(\mathcal{L}\) is the luminosity.

The uncertainties in the tables indicate that at high transverse energy, the rate computation is not very precise. Nevertheless, with the requirement of keeping the EF output rate at a few Hz for each multi \(b\)-jet signature, trigger menus for different luminosities can be chosen as:

* luminosity \(10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\): **3b23_3L1J23**, **3b18_4L1J18**

Figure 20: The correlation between L2, EF and offline taggers* luminosity \(10^{32}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\): **2b42_31.1J42**, **3b35_31.1J35**, **3b23_41.1J23**, **4b18_41.1J18**
* luminosity \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\): **2b70_31.1J70**, **3b42_31.1J42**, **3b35_41.1J35**, **4b23_41.1J23**

Figure 21: \(b\)-jet performance based on the combination of the transverse and longitudinal impact parameter (EF selection starts from the chosen L2 working point).

Figure 22: Rate reduction achieved with HLT \(b\)-jet as a function of the L1 \(E_{T}\)threshold.

It can be noticed that as the luminosity increases, requiring more \(b\)-tagged jets is a viable alternative to increasing \(E_{T}\)thresholds.

The strategy behind the evolution of the \(b\)-jet signatures is to select more aggressively as luminosity increases and HLT tracking becomes better understood. Before the \(b\)-jet trigger achieves full performance, a good online resolution of track impact parameters must be achieved. In turn, this requires adequate knowledge of the inner detector alignment and sufficient understanding of the overall detector performance.

### Prospects for measuring efficiency and correlation with offline on real data

The HLT \(b\)-tagging group is working closely with the offline \(b\)-tagging group to develop a method to measure the \(b\)-jet efficiency with real data. For an explanation of the method and a discussion of its performance we refer to the \(b\)-tagging note on dijets [5].

In addition to the "physics" triggers listed in the previous Section, the \(b\)-jet group has introduced several "technical" triggers in order to study rate and correlation of the online and offline algorithms:

* single \(b\)-jet signatures: \(b18\), \(b23\), \(b35\), \(b42\), \(b70\): prescaled to limit their contribution to the EF output to few Hz;
* each multi jet item is duplicated with an identical signature which selects, independently of the HLT \(b\)-jet result, one over \(n\) events (where \(n\) is presently set at 1000 but will be tuned according to the rate allocated to \(b\)-jet triggers).

## 6 Summary and conclusions

The \(b\)-jet selection at the L2 and EF stages of the ATLAS High Level Trigger has been described and characterized. An HLT \(b\)-tagging trigger menu has been implemented which demonstrates the feasibility of increasing the acceptance of events with more than one \(b\)-jet by decreasing L1 jet \(E_{T}\)thresholds while controlling the output rate by introducing a \(b\)-jet selection at the HLT.
