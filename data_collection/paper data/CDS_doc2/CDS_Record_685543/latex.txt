###### Abstract

The b-tagging performance of the ATLAS Inner Detector with 400\(\mu\)m longitudinal pixel pitch in the b-layer is compared with that of the default DC0/DC1 layout with b-layer pixel pitch of 300 \(\mu\)m. This study is intended to be the simulation backup document for the corresponding Engineering Change Request [1].

## 1 Introduction

The default DC0/DC1 layout of the ATLAS pixel detector has a pixel size of 50 \(\mu\)m x 400 \(\mu\)m with 250 \(\mu\)m sensor thickness in the external barrel layers (so called layer-1 and layer-2) and end-cap disks. In the b-layer the pixel size is assumed to be 50 \(\mu\)m x 300 \(\mu\)m with 200 \(\mu\)m sensor thickness. In this case b-layer modules are different from other pixel modules. Unification of the pixel modules to one type can simplify the production and accelerate the installation schedule for the Initial ATLAS Detector. In this document we study the influence of the increase of the pixel longitudinal pitch from 300 \(\mu\)m to 400 \(\mu\)m. We neglect the small effect of the increase of the thickness from 200 \(\mu\)m to 250 \(\mu\)m, since it is believed to be very small and would require the regeneration of the simulated data samples.

The main figure of merit of b-tagging quality is the rejection of light quark and gluon jets \(R_{u}\) for a given efficiency of the b-quark tagging \(\epsilon_{b}\). The b-tagging performance is first studied in the associated WH production with Higgs boson masses \(m_{\rm H}=100,120\) and 400 GeV/\(c^{2}\) in DC0 and DC1 data samples. The _natural_\(\rm H\to b\overline{b}\) Higgs boson decay mode is used for b-jets and the artificial \(\rm H\to u\overline{u}\) decay mode is used for the background light jets. In this case, signal b-jets and background light jets originate from separate data samples. This channel was widely used in previous studies, in particular in the b-tagging section of the Physics TDR [2].

The second study uses the associated \(\rm t\overline{t}H\) production with \(m_{\rm H}=120\) GeV/\(c^{2}\) as a signal channel and \(\rm t\overline{t}\) production as background. The b-jets originate either from \(\rm H\to b\overline{b}\) decay, or from \(\rm t\to bW\) decay. The light jets are either from \(\rm W\to q\,\overline{q}\,^{\prime}\) decays or from initial or final state radiation. The b-tagging performance in the \(\rm t\overline{t}H\) and \(\rm t\overline{t}\) reactions was studied in [3].

## 2 b-tagging methods

The b-tagging method using the transverse impact parameter (2D) is described in the b-tagging section of the Physics TDR [2]. In the 3D b-tagging method the longitudinal impact parameter \(z_{0}\) is used together with the transverse one in order to construct the two dimensional likelihood functions [4]. The secondary vertex b-tagging method (SV) using as discriminating variables the invariant mass of the tracks in the secondary vertex, the ratio of the energy in the secondary vertex to the total jet energy and the number of two track secondary vertices is described in Ref. [5].

The following quality cuts are applied on the reconstructed tracks selected for b-tagging :

* \(p_{T}\geq 1\) GeV/\(c\),
* at least seven digits in pixels and SCT,
* at least two pixel digits,
* one digit in the b-layer,
* transverse impact parameter limited to 1 mm,
* good quality of the track fit with \(\chi^{2}\leq 3\),
* longitudinal impact parameter limited by \(|z_{0}-z_{vertex}|\sin\theta\leq 1.5\) mm,* the track should not share any pixel cluster with other tracks,
* the track should not share more than one silicon strip (SCT) cluster with other tracks,
* the track should not have ambiguous cluster in the pixel b-layer.

In this study the same cuts were applied in the layouts with two or three pixel layers.

## 3 b-tagging with DC0 WH samples

DC0 data samples of \(\mathrm{WH}\rightarrow\mu\nu\mathrm{b\overline{b}},\mu\nu\mathrm{u\overline{u}}\) events with \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=100,400\) GeV/\(c^{2}\) were simulated with GEANT3/ATLSIM starting from the same events used for the Physics TDR (PYTHIA 5.7 under ATGEN with CTEQ4L structure functions). The latest version of the pixel geometry and digitization was used. 20000 events were simulated in each data sample. New low luminosity conditions with \(L=2\times 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) (pileup of 4.6 events per bunch crossing) were used in these simulations. The track reconstruction was done by the xKalman++ pattern recognition program (version xKalmanppAtrecon-00-036, release 3.0.1). In the simple 2D and 3D b-tagging the beams intersection point (\(\vec{x}=0.15\) mm, \(\vec{y}=1.5\) mm) was used as the transverse event primary vertex and the Monte Carlo truth longitudinal vertex was used for the longitudinal primary vertex. The jet direction from the KINE particles was used.

### Simple b-tagging results

The reduced pixel layout without pixel barrel layer-1 and without disk-2 was considered. This layout is close to the Initial ATLAS layout, except for the presence of the TRT C-wheels. The loss of performance with 400 \(\mu\)m long pixels is characterized by the ratio of rejections \(R=R_{400/300}=R_{u~{}400~{}\mu m}/R_{u~{}300~{}\mu m}\). Additional module and chip inefficiencies were set to 1% and 2% respectively. The results in terms of light jet rejections with 2D and 3D b-tagging are shown in Tables 1 and 2 respectively.

As expected the loss of performance is on average bigger for the 3D method (\(R\sim 0.89\)) where the longitudinal impact parameter is directly used, than for the 2D method (\(R\sim 0.95\)).

As the same events are used for the 300 \(\mu\)m and 400 \(\mu\)m data we expect the error on \(R\) to be smaller than the statistical error without correlations. One should also mention that the statistical errors quoted for the rejections are rather naive and should be considered with care. In particular no special correction is made for the fact that the same events are used to build the likelihood functions and to compute the rejections and efficiencies. Moreover, the ratio of rejections is calculated on highly correlated data samples; for that reason we do not quote the error on this ratio.

### Secondary vertex b-tagging with reduced layout

Samples of DC0 \(\mathrm{WH}\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}},\mathrm{u}\overline{\mathrm{u}}\) events with \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=100\)\(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\) were used to test the influence of 400 \(\mu\)m long pixels on the secondary vertex b-tagging method for the reduced layout.

The 2D and 3D results are slightly better when using secondary vertices, since the tracks from vertices in the beam-pipe, b-layer and tracks from \(\mathrm{K}_{0},\Lambda\) etc have been removed. Secondary vertex variables are used in the likelihood

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|} \hline  & 300 \(\mu\)m b-layer & 400 \(\mu\)m b-layer & \(R_{400/300}\) \\ \hline \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\)=100 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\)\(\epsilon_{b}\) = 50 \% & \(139\pm 10\) & \(128\pm 9\) & 0.92 \\ \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\)=100 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\)\(\epsilon_{b}\) = 60 \% & \(49\pm\ 2\) & \(45\pm 2\) & 0.90 \\ \hline \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\)=400 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\)\(\epsilon_{b}\) = 50 \% & \(111\pm\ 6\) & \(109\pm 6\) & 0.98 \\ \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\)=400 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\)\(\epsilon_{b}\) = 60 \% & \(44\pm\ 2\) & \(44\pm 2\) & 0.99 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

functions on top of the simple 3D b-tagging ones. Two slightly different variants of SV b-tagging were used:

* \(SV2=3D+(E_{vertex}/E_{jet}+Mass_{vertex})_{2d}+N_{vertex}\), where the energy ratio and vertex mass variables are combined in a two-dimensional distribution, while the number of two track vertices \(N_{vertex}\) is used in a separate one dimensional distribution;
* \(SV3=3D+(E_{vertex}/E_{jet}+Mass_{vertex}+N_{vertex})_{3d}\), where the energy ratio, vertex mass and number of two track vertices variables are combined in a three-dimensional distribution.

A detailed description of the combination of impact parameter 3D method with secondary vertex information is given in [5].

Module and chip inefficiencies of 1% and 2% were used. The results in rejections of light jets are shown in Table 3. SV2 and SV3 methods give rather similar results. Despite large statistical fluctuations one can see that a 400 \(\mu\)m pixel pitch introduce a deterioration of the performance, which is more important for 3D and SV methods with \(R\sim\) 0.86.

### 3 pixel layer layout with secondary vertex b-tag

Another question is if the deterioration due to 400\(\mu\)m pixels exists for the full ATLAS layout with 3 barrel pixel layers and 3 disks. This was checked on the samples of DC0 WH \(\rightarrow\) b\(\overline{\rm b},\rm u\overline{\rm u}\) events with \(m_{\rm H}\) = 400 GeV/\(c^{2}\)

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|} \hline  & 300 \(\mu\)m b-layer & 400 \(\mu\)m b-layer & \(R_{400/300}\) \\ \hline
2D \(\epsilon_{b}\) = 50 \% & \(143\pm 10\) & \(138\pm 10\) & 0.96 \\
2D \(\epsilon_{b}\) = 60 \% & \(52\pm\ 2\) & \(46\pm\ 2\) & 0.88 \\ \hline
3D \(\epsilon_{b}\) = 50 \% & \(382\pm 45\) & \(317\pm 39\) & 0.82 \\
3D \(\epsilon_{b}\) = 60 \% & \(115\pm\ 8\) & \(103\pm\ 6\) & 0.89 \\ \hline SV2 \(\epsilon_{b}\) = 50 \% & \(520\pm 70\) & \(453\pm 57\) & 0.87 \\ SV2 \(\epsilon_{b}\) = 60 \% & \(130\pm\ 9\) & \(115\pm\ 7\) & 0.88 \\ \hline SV3 \(\epsilon_{b}\) = 50 \% & \(538\pm 74\) & \(458\pm 58\) & 0.85 \\ SV3 \(\epsilon_{b}\) = 60 \% & \(133\pm\ 9\) & \(112\pm\ 7\) & 0.84 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Light jet rejections in DC0 WH(100) events for SV b-tagging and the reduced layout (with inefficiencies).

The results are shown in Table 4. The deterioration due to 400 \(\mu\)m pixels is of the same order for the Full ATLAS layout and the reduced layout.

### Conclusion from DC0 WH samples

Despite low statistics and an old version of the software DC0 WH events are interesting because they are exactly the same that were used for the published results of the Physics TDR. The deterioration is small for 2D b-tagging with \(R\sim 0.96\), bigger for 3D b-tagging method with \(R\sim 0.90\) and secondary vertex method \(R\sim 0.86\). In the following section results for the high statistics DC1 WH event samples reconstructed with a more recent version of the software are given.

## 4 b-tagging with DC1 WH samples

DC1 data samples of \(\mathrm{WH}\rightarrow\mu\nu\mathrm{b\overline{b}},\mu\nu\mathrm{u\overline{u}}\) events with \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=120,400\) GeV/\(c^{2}\) were simulated with GEANT3/ATLSIM starting from the new events generated for DC1 (PYTHIA 6.203 under the ATHENA framework with CTEQ5L structure functions and the underlying event (simulated by multiple parton interaction model) tuned to CDF data). The latest version of the DC1 pixel geometry and digitization was used. Hyperons and K\({}_{S}^{0}\) were allowed to interact with the ATLAS detector (_e.g._ in the beam pipe or b-layer) and

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r r|r r|} \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{300 \(\mu\)m b-layer} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{400 \(\mu\)m b-layer} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\(R_{400/300}\)} \\ \hline
2D \(\epsilon_{b}=\) 50 \% & \(178\pm\ 13\) & \(173\pm\ 12\) & 0.97 \\
2D \(\epsilon_{b}=\) 60 \% & \(62\pm\ 3\) & \(64\pm\ 3\) & 1.03 \\ \hline
3D \(\epsilon_{b}=\) 50 \% & \(364\pm\ 36\) & \(313\pm\ 29\) & 0.86 \\
3D \(\epsilon_{b}=\) 60 \% & \(107\pm\ 6\) & \(98\pm\ 5\) & 0.91 \\ \hline SV2 \(\epsilon_{b}=\) 50 \% & \(788\pm 116\) & \(755\pm 108\) & 0.96 \\ SV2 \(\epsilon_{b}=\) 60 \% & \(296\pm\ 26\) & \(214\pm\ 16\) & 0.72 \\ \hline SV3 \(\epsilon_{b}=\) 50 \% & \(816\pm 121\) & \(807\pm 120\) & 0.99 \\ SV3 \(\epsilon_{b}=\) 60 \% & \(307\pm\ 28\) & \(240\pm\ 19\) & 0.78 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Light jet rejections in DC0 WH(400) events for SV b-tagging and the complete layout (with inefficiencies).

charged hyperons were allowed to produce hits (_e.g._ in the b-layer) before the eventual decays. 20000 events were used in the \(\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) data sample, 100000 events in the \(\mathrm{u\overline{u}}\) data sample with \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=120\)\(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\) and 50000 events in the \(\mathrm{u\overline{u}}\) data sample with \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=400\)\(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\). New low luminosity conditions with \(L=2\times 10^{33}\)\(\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\) were used in these simulations. An increased pixel wafer buffer size of 4096 digits (axxxrec-00-05-11, starting from release 6.1.0) was used, which eliminates the effects of the buffer overflows observed in preliminary studies. The track reconstruction was done by the xKalman++ pattern recognition program (version xKalmanppAtrecon-00-00-74). The Monte Carlo truth vertex or the reconstructed VKalVrt vertex were used for the primary vertex in the simple 2D and 3D b-tagging. The jet direction from ATLFAST was used.

### Simple b-tagging results

The same reduced pixel layout (no layer-1 and no disk-2) as in DC0 study (section 3.1) was used. As a reference, results without additional module and chip inefficiencies are first shown. Light jet rejections with 2D and 3D b-tagging are in the Tables 5 and 6 respectively.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|} \hline  & 300 \(\mu\)m b-layer & 400 \(\mu\)m b-layer & \(R_{400/300}\) \\ \hline MC truth vertex & & & \\ \hline \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\)=120 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\)\(\epsilon_{b}=50\) \% & \(146\pm 4\) & \(139\pm 4\) & 0.95 \\ \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\)=120 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\)\(\epsilon_{b}=60\) \% & \(50\pm 1\) & \(48\pm 1\) & 0.96 \\ \hline VKalVrt vertex & & & \\ \hline \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\)=120 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\)\(\epsilon_{b}=50\) \% & \(141\pm 4\) & \(133\pm 3\) & 0.94 \\ \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\)=120 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\)\(\epsilon_{b}=60\) \% & \(48\pm 1\) & \(46\pm 1\) & 0.96 \\ \hline MC truth vertex & & & \\ \hline \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\)=400 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\)\(\epsilon_{b}=50\) \% & \(127\pm 4\) & \(123\pm 3\) & 0.97 \\ \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\)=400 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\)\(\epsilon_{b}=60\) \% & \(46\pm 1\) & \(44\pm 1\) & 0.96 \\ \hline VKalVrt vertex & & & \\ \hline \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\)=400 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\)\(\epsilon_{b}=50\) \% & \(125\pm 4\) & \(120\pm 3\) & 0.96 \\ \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\)=400 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\)\(\epsilon_{b}=60\) \% & \(46\pm 1\) & \(43\pm 1\) & 0.94 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Light jet rejections in DC1 WH events for 2D b-tagging (no inefficiencies).

As expected the loss of performance is on average bigger for the 3D method (\(R\sim 0.90\)) than for the 2D method (\(R\sim 0.96\)). Despite the fact that using the reconstructed primary vertex the b-tagging performance is reduced, the relative effect of the loss of performance due to 400 \(\mu\)m pixels is unchanged.

One important advantage of using a single module type for all layers is that it is now possible to select the best modules with the highest efficiency for the b-layer. This can compensate the negative effect of 400 \(\mu\)m pixels. We assumed that the selection of the best modules will improve the inefficiency by a factor two. So module/chip inefficiencies of 0.5/1.0 % in the b-layer and 1.0/2.0 % in all other layers are used.

Light jet rejections for 3D b-tagging and selection of the best modules in the b-layer are shown in Table 7. The reconstructed primary vertex was used. The selection of the best modules compensates almost completely the degradation due to 400 \(\mu\)m pixels. In this case the average loss factor is \(R\sim 0.97\) (Table 7) instead of \(R\sim 0.90\) (Table 6).

### Secondary vertex b-tagging results

The secondary vertex b-tagging methods used for DC0 WH events were applied to DC1 WH events. Only a slight modification of the binning in the likelihood functions was made. The primary vertex was reconstructed with the VKalVrt package.

The results in rejections of light jets for WH events for \(m_{\rm H}=120\) GeV/\(c^{2}\) and \(m_{\rm H}=400\) GeV/\(c^{2}\) and without chip/module inefficiency are shown in the Tables 8 and 9 respectively.

With more statistics than in DC0 WH samples one can see that 400 \(\mu\)m

pixels introduce a deterioration of the performance, which is more important for the 3D and SV methods with \(R\sim\) 0.91.

### Conclusion from DC1 WH samples

The b-tagging deterioration due to the increased pixel size in DC1 WH samples is small for 2D b-tagging with \(R\sim\) 0.96 and more important for simple 3D b-tagging method with \(R\sim\) 0.90. The choice of the best modules for the b-layer almost completely compensates (or even overcompensates) the loss due to the 400 \(\mu\)m pixels (\(R\sim\) 0.97).

More complicate and better performing b-tagging methods with secondary vertices are more sensitive to the increase of the pixel size with a reduction of light jet rejection by a factor \(R\sim\) 0.91.

## 5 ttH and tt with 400 micron pixels

While WH studies are interesting thanks to the relative simplicity of the final state and a clear separation of b-jet and light quark jet samples, they do not address a channel which is promising for Higgs boson discovery at LHC.

On the other hand, the ttH\(\rightarrow\)b\(\overline{\rm b}\) channel is expected to be one of the best discovery channels in the low mass region, therefore the b-tagging performance has been studied also for this process. tt production represents one

of the main backgrounds to the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}H}\) signal, and is a very interesting source of light and b-jets.

For this study the Initial ATLAS configuration is considered: 2 pixel layers, 2 pixel disks, no TRT C wheels. We use samples of \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}H}\) (\(m_{\mathrm{\,H}}\) = 120 GeV/\(c^{2}\)) and \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events. Module and chip inefficiencies were assumed to be 1% and 2%. b-jets from top quark and Higgs decays were used as a signal. u/d/s-jets from W-decays were used as a light jet source [3]. The results in rejections of light jets are shown in Table 10.

As seen in WH studies, the difference between 400 \(\mu\)m and 300 \(\mu\)m b-layer longitudinal pixel pitch is more pronounced in the 3D method.

If the best modules are used in the b-layer we assume module and chip inefficiencies of 0.5% and 1% in b layer. In this case the effect of the longer pixel size is almost completely compensated by higher performance in pixel efficiency, as seen in Table 11.

## 6 Conclusions

* 2D b-tagging is little sensitive to 400 \(\mu\)m b-layer pixel pitch with 4 % average worsening.

* 3D b-tagging degrades on average by 10 % with 400 \(\mu\)m b-layer pixel pitch.
* 3D + vertex b-tagging is also sensitive to 400 \(\mu\)m b-layer pixel pitch with 10 % worsening.
* The effect of the 400 \(\mu\)m b-layer pixel pitch can be almost completely compensated by choosing the best modules in the b-layer.
* Next generation of studies should take into account the remaining small effects : 250 \(\mu\)m b-layer thickness, latest results from the test beam on the performance of pixels with new FE-I electronics, detailed description of the chip and MCC buffers, better estimations of the contributions of noisy pixels and early events to the buffer occupancy.
