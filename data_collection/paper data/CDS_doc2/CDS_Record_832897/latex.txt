Introduction

The constructed ATLAS detector at the LHC will have the great physics discovery potential, in particular in the detection of a heavy Higgs boson [1, 2]. Calorimeters will play a crucial role in it. It is necessary to have confidence that the calorimeters will perform as expected.

With the aim of establishing of the electromagnetic energy scale and understanding of performance of the ATLAS Tile calorimeter to electrons 12% of modules have been exposed in electron beams with various energies by three possible ways: cell-scan at \(\theta=20^{o}\) at the centers of the front face cells, \(\eta\) scan (\(\eta\) is a pseudorapidity, \(\eta=-\ln\tan((90^{o}-\theta)/2)\) in the case of the test beam setup) and literow scan at \(\theta=90^{o}\) for the module side cells.

At high energies the electromagnetic fraction is an essential part of an hadronic shower. According to [3], it is parameterized as \(f_{em}=0.11\ln\,E\), [E]=GeV, and amounts to 25% at 10 GeV, 50% at 100 GeV and 91% at 4000 GeV.

This work is devoted to the determination of the electron energy resolutions of the ATLAS iron-scintillator tile hadron calorimeter modules JINR-55, IFA-42 and ANL-44 on the basis of the July 2002 test beam period using the fit filter method of the PMT signal reconstruction.

The electromagnetic calibration of these modules have been performed in [5, 6, 7, 8].

Earlier the electron energy resolutions for the modules JINR-34, IFA-15 and IFA-24, exposed in the September 2001 test beam run, were obtained in [9].

## 2 The ATLAS Hadron Tile Calorimeter

The ATLAS Hadron Tile Calorimeter (TileCal) is a 2900 t sampling calorimeter using iron as passive material and tiles of scintillator as active material readout by wavelength shifting fibers [4]. This calorimeter will play a very important role to identify jets, measure their energy and direction, reconstruct the transverse missing energy. The goal of the TileCal is to measure hadrons energy with good resolution (\(\sigma/E=50\%\sqrt{GeV}/\sqrt{E}\oplus 3\%\)) and linearity (1-2 % up to TeV scale).

An innovative feature of this calorimeter is the orientation of the scintillators that are placed in planes perpendicular to the colliding beams(Fig. 1 (left)). This disposition simplifies the tile-fiber and fiber-PMT coupling reducing the dead spaces of the calorimeter and hence increasing hermecity. Due to this feature we can get an hermetic coverage up to \(\mid\eta\mid=1.7\) (\(\mid\eta\mid=5\) with forward calorimeters). This is very important for the reconstruction of the transverse missing energy.

The TileCal is divided into one barrel and two extended barrel sections. All three sections have a cylindrical structure with an inner radius of 2280 mm and outer one of 4230 mm. The barrel section is 5460 mm in length along the beam axis, while each extended barrel has a length of about 2910 mm. Each of the cylinders is further subdivided into 64 independent azimuthally oriented modules. Within each module, there are a number of readout cells. Each cell is a set of scintillating tiles connected by fibers to 2 PMTs. The TileCal will contain 4672 cells which will be read-out by 9344 PMTs. Two fibres collect light from every scintillator tile at both of its azimuthal edges. The total number of tiles is 456000.

In this way, the calorimeter is divided in \(\eta\times\phi\) towers, which have a "pseudo-projective" geometry pointing to the nominal interaction point, and radially segmented in three depths. The thicknesses of depths at \(\eta\)=0 are 1.5 \(\lambda\) (\(\lambda\) is the nuclear interaction length) in the first sampling, 4.2 \(\lambda\) in the second one, and 1.9 \(\lambda\) in the third one, with a total depth of 7.6 \(\lambda\). The granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) at \(\eta\)=0 is 0.1\(\times\)0.1 for the first two depths and 0.2\(\times\)0.1 in the third compartment.

The iron structure of each module consists of a number of repeated periods (Fig. 1 (right)). Each period is 18 mm thick and consists of four layers. The first and third layers are formed by large trapezoidal steel plates (master plates), and spanning the full longitudinal dimension of the module. In the second and fourth layers, smaller trapezoidal steel plates (spacer plates) and scintillator tiles alternate. These layers consist of 11 different trapezoids of steel and scintillator, each spanning from 97 to 187 mm. The master plates, spacer plates and scintillator tiles are of 5 mm, 4 mm and 3 mm thick, respectively. The iron to scintillator ratio is 4.67:1 by volume.

## 3 Test beam setup

The test beam setup used for the calibration is the following (Fig. 2).

The Barrel Module 0 is the bottom module mounted on the table. The middle layer is the production barrel module BM\(\pm\) (JINR-55). The Figure 1: Principle of the TileCal (left). Exploded view of an assembled TileCal period (right).

Figure 2: Sketch of the July 2002 test beam setup. Barrel module JINR-55 is the middle layer. Extended Barrel modules IFA-42 \(\eta>0\) (beam left) and ANL-44 \(\eta<0\) (beam right) are the top layer.

top layer is the two extended barrel modules: EBM+ (IFA-42) for \(\eta>0\) (beam left) and EBM\(-\) (ANL-44) for \(\eta<0\) (beam right). Bad PMT channel is 9 connected with the A2 cell of the BM+ module.

The layout of the readout cell geometry for modules is shown in Fig. 3. Each module is read out in three longitudinal layers. The first layer consists of A-cells, the second one -- of B- and C-cells, and the third one -- of D-cells. There are 11 transverse rows of tiles (tilerows) in a

module. For a barrel module A-cells have the \(1-3\) tilerows, B- and C-cells have the \(4-7\) tilerows, D-cells have the \(10-11\) tilerows. For a extended barrel module A-cells have the \(1-3\) tilerows, B- and C-cells have the \(4-6\) tilerows, D-cells have the \(7-11\) ones.

The calibration program with electrons, pions and muons was performed in the H8 beam at the CERN SPS.

### Data

We have used the July 2002 exposition of the setup by the electron beams with energies the 10, 20, 50, 100, 180 GeV at \(\theta=\pm 20^{o}\), \(\theta=90^{\circ}\), \(\eta=0.05\div 1.45\). The volume of the analyzed information is the following: 390 ntuples, 200 Gbyte, 15 million events.

### Calibration volume

Since the electron calibration constants will be used for the hadron energy reconstruction [12, 13] we have summed the energy depositions in the cells inside of the cone with the radius \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}}\) in the \(\eta\times\phi\) space. The value of \(\Delta R\) is equal to 0.4 for single hadrons and 0.7 for jets [14, 15]. For the Tile calorimeter module \(\Delta\phi\) is 0.1 and therefore for \(\Delta R=0.4\) we take \(\Delta\eta=0.4\). This corresponds to whole extended barrel module and half of barrel module (Fig. 3).

### PMT signal reconstruction method

For the PMT signal reconstruction we have used the flat filter method [16, 17]. In this method the value of the PMT signal, \(R_{flat}\), is an integral, a maximum of all possible sums of 5 subsequent samples of the pulse shape of a PMT signal which is sampled 9 times with the 25 ns interval

\[R_{flat}=C_{cis}\cdot\max\left(\sum_{i=j}^{j+4}(s_{i}-s_{1})\right). \tag{1}\]

The first sample \((s_{1})\) is considered as a pedestal and its value is subtracted from all other samples \((s_{i})\). Here \(C_{cis}\) is the constant transforming the ADC values into pC derived from CIS events, \(j=2,\ \ldots,\ 5\). As a consequence of finding the maximum, the flat filter method exhibitspositive offset for the pedestal-like events. For majority of PMTs this offset, \(\langle R_{noi\,se}\rangle\), and \(RMS_{noise}\) do not exceed 0.016 pC and 0.06 pC, correspondingly, amounts to 0.01 pC and 0.05 pC, in average, as can be seen in Fig. 4. Besides, there are tails, 10% PMTs are with larger noise.

Such average positive offset for any PMT leads to the big total positive offset of about 0.4 GeV when summing all PMTs, for example, of half of a barrel module and correspondingly to the 4% shift of the calibration constants at 10 GeV.

We have devised the following algorithm excluding positive offset of the pedestal-like events. We analyze all signals in each channel of each event. If the value of some signal in \(i\)-channel less than \(3\cdot RMS_{noise,i}\) then this signal is decreased on the value of \(\langle R_{no^{ise},i}\rangle\). So, we obtain unshifted values of \(\langle R_{noise,i}\rangle\).

### Electron selection

The H8 electron beams at the SPS CERN are the mixture of electrons, muons and hadrons. For calibration it is important to have the pure electron beam. We have estimated that in order to have the systematic error in the electron calibration constant due to the pion contamination

Figure 4: The distributions of mean values of PMT noise (left) and RMS values (right) of 142 PMTs used in the test beam July 2002 for the flat filter method (JINR-55, ANL-44, IFA-42). The peak values are \(\langle R_{noise}\rangle\)=10 MeV and \(RMS_{noise}\)=50 MeV.

smaller than 0.3 % this contamination must be smaller than 1.5 % in the energy range of \(10-300\) GeV [19].

Therefore, we have performed the identification of \((e,\,\mu,\,\pi)\) particles on the basis of the calorimetric information. We have used the following three selection criteria [19].

#### 3.4.1 Electron selection using longitudinal shower energy deposition

The first selection criterion

\[C_{i}=\sum_{selected\,\,\,\,i}\,\,\,\sum_{k=1}^{2}\sum_{l=1}^{2}E_{ik\,l}/E_{ beam}\,, \tag{2}\]

is a value of the relative shower energy deposition in the first two calorimeter depths, where \(E_{ikl}\) is the energy response of an \(ikl\) PMT, \([E_{ikl}]=p\,C\), \(k\) is a depth number, \(i\) is a cell number in the \(k\)-depth, \(l=1,\,\,2\) is the PMT number in the \(ik\) cell, \([C_{i}]=p\,C/GeV\).

The basis for this electron-hadron separation is the different longitudinal energy deposition for electrons and hadrons. For example, if a 100 GeV particle crosses 45 cm of the Tile calorimeter from the front face it corresponds to 18 radiation lengths or 2.2 nuclear interaction lengths. The amount of the deposited energy is equal to 95% for the electromagnetic shower and only 50% for the hadronic shower [20].

Fig. 5 (left) shows the typical \(C_{i}\) distributions. The left peak corresponds to the pion events, the right peak corresponds to the electron events.

#### 3.4.2 Electron selection using lateral shower energy deposition

The second selection criterion is related with the lateral shower spread

\[E_{cut}=\frac{\sqrt{\sum_{c}(E_{c}^{a}-\sum_{c}E_{c}^{a}/N_{cell})^{2}}}{\sum_{ c}E_{c}^{a}}\, \tag{3}\]

where \(1\leq c\leq N_{cell}\), \(N_{\alpha\,ll}\) is the used cells number, \(\alpha=0.6\). For example, for the 100 GeV hadronic shower the 99% containment radius is equal to 430 mm, but for the electromagnetic shower the one is equal to 70 mm.

Figure 5: The \(C_{i}\) (top-left) and \(E_{cut}\) (top-right) distributions and the scatter plot \(E_{cut}\) versus \(C_{i}\) (middle). The scatter plots of \(E_{cut}\) vs \(\check{\rm C}_{1}\) and \(C_{i}\) vs \(\check{\rm C}_{1}\) (bottom).

Fig. 5 (center) shows the typical \(E_{cut}\) distributions. The left peak corresponds to the pion events, the right peak corresponds to the electron events.

Fig. 5 (right) shows the scatter plot of \(E_{cut}\) versus \(C_{i}\). The top right region are the electron events, the bottom left region are the pion events. These Figures allow to determine the values of the cuts and to estimate the contaminations.

We have estimated by extrapolation of the fitted pion peak curve to the region of the electron peak (Figs. 5) that the contamination of the pion events in the electron events does not exceed the 0.2% level [19].

#### 3.4.3 Rejection of muons

For the muon rejection at energies \(E_{beam}\geq 10GeV\) we have used the cut in the total deposited energy: \(E_{tot}>E_{min}\) with \(E_{min}=5\) GeV [21]. This cut effectively selects muons as muons loose a very small fraction of their energy in the calorimeter.

#### 3.4.4 Electrons selection using Cherenkov counter

At energies \(\leq 20\) GeV there is a bad selection of electrons by the \(C_{i}\) and \(E_{cut}\) criteria. This situation is greatly improved by using the first Cherenkov counter signal (cut 3). Fig. 5 (bottom)shows the typical scatter plots of \(E_{cut}\) versus \(\tilde{\rm C}_{1}\) and \(C_{i}\) versus \(\tilde{\rm C}_{1}\). As seen, electrons (left) are well selected.

#### 3.4.5 Resultant cuts

We have used the following three cuts for the electron selection [19]: the cut 1 is \(C_{i}>0.9\div 1.1\), the cut 2 is \(E_{cut}>0.07\div 0.14\), the cut 3 is \(\tilde{\rm C}_{1}>200\div 400\). Due to these cuts we have obtained the clean sample of the electron events for the calibration of modules of the TILECAL.

## 4 Electron Energy Resolution

The usual practice of the determination of the resolution is to fit an energy distribution by Gaussian. But this is not our case at angles are distinguished from \(90^{o}\) because of the longitudinal displacement of tiles which leads to the sine response. Therefore, we have extracted the mean relative electron energy resolutions, \(\sigma/E\), from the distributions of \(RMS/E\) as a function of the impact point \(Z\) coordinate for each A-cell at various energies. It turned out that such relative \(RMS/E\) values almost independent from the impact point \(Z\) coordinate

Figs. 7-10 show the \(\sigma/E\) values for the A-cells of \(EBM-\), \(EBM+\), \(BM-\), \(BM+\) at \(\theta=20^{o}\) as a function of A-cell number. Tables 1 - 2 give the corresponding numerical values. Fig. 11 (top and middle rows) shows the energy dependencies these values averaged over cells.

Figs. 12-14 and Tables 3-4 show the \(\sigma/E\) values for \(EBM\) and \(BM\) modules as a function of \(\eta\). Fig. 15 (top and middle rows) shows the energy dependencies these values averaged over \(\eta\) values. The obtained parameters \(a\) and \(b\) are shown in Fig. 15 (bottom row).

Figs. 16-19 and Tables 5-6 show the \(\sigma/E\) values for \(EBM\) and \(BM\) modules for \(\theta=90^{o}\) as a function of a Tilerow number. Fig. 20 (top and middle rows) shows the energy dependencies these values averaged over tilerows.

Table 7 gives summary of the average values (%) of the parameters \(a\) and \(b\) for \(\theta=20^{o}\) and \(90^{o}\) and \(\eta\) scan. The electron energy resolution

for \(\theta=90^{o}\) are of 30% smaller the ones for \(\theta=20^{o}\).

We have fitted the electron energy resolution data by the quadratic fit expression

\[\sigma/E={a_{s}}/\sqrt{E}\oplus b_{s} \tag{4}\]

and the linear fit expression

\[\sigma/E={a_{l}}/\sqrt{E}+b_{l}. \tag{5}\]

Table 7 gives summary of the average values (%) of the parameters \(a\) and \(b\) for \(\theta=20^{o}\) and \(90^{o}\) and \(\eta\) scan. The electron energy resolution for \(\theta=90^{o}\) are of 30% smaller the ones for \(\theta=20^{o}\).

We have compared our results on energy resolution with the parameterization suggested in [22]:

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{a_{\,MC}}{\sqrt{E}}=\frac{\sigma_{0}}{\sqrt{E}}\left( \frac{t}{X_{Fe}}\right)^{\gamma}\left(\frac{s}{X_{S}}\right)^{-\delta}, \tag{6}\]

where in our case \(\sigma_{0}=6.33\)\(\%\sqrt{GeV}\), \(\gamma=0.62\), \(\delta=0.21\) are the parameters, \(X_{Fe}\), and \(X_{S}\) are the radiation lengths of iron and scintillator, \(t\) and \(s\) are the thicknesses of iron and scintillator. In our case \(t=14\)\(mm/\sin\theta\) and \(s=3\)\(mm/\sin\theta\). This formula is purely empirical and the parameters have been determined by fitting the Monte Carlo EGS4 data. The accuracy of this formula is 10%.

According to (6), the electron energy resolution is directly proportional to the iron thickness and inversely proportional to the scintillator thickness. Because of the triple difference in the values of power the absorber thickness plays a dominant role in the quantity of the electron energy resolution.

In our case this formula can be represented as a function of \(\theta\) angle:

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{15.6\ [\%\sqrt{GeV}]}{\sqrt{E}\cdot(\sin\theta)^{0.41}}. \tag{7}\]

Fig. 21 shows the obtained parameters of the quadratic fit for all scans data, the prototype data [10] and the \(90^{o}\) data from [14, 11] as a function of \(\theta\) angle. As can be seen, the parameters \(a_{s}\) and \(b_{s}\) decrease as \(\theta\) increase. The parameter \(a_{s}\) for the prototype module [10] is greater than for production modules. The parameter \(b_{s}\) is of about 5% at small angles and decreases to \(1-2\%\) at \(90^{o}\). It may be connected with the unconventional orientation of the scintillating tiles which are along incident Figure 16: The electron energy resolution for the tilerows of \(EBM-\) for \(\theta=90^{\circ}\).

particles. The curve in the Fig. 21 (left) is the modified parameterization (6) from [22]. The curves in Fig. 21 (right) are similar to (7) and given only to guide the eye.

As can be seen in Fig. 21 and in Table 7, for the linear fit the agreement is observed within the errors between the experimental and Monte Carlo results, except the prototypes points. It is necessary to note that the Monte Carlo calculations in [22] have been performed for the iron - scintillator thicknesses of \(t\leq 35\) mm and \(s\leq 10\) mm. It means in our case \(\theta>25^{o}\). So, this parameterization is more extended than expected. As for the quadratic fit (Fig. 21) we have been forced to increase the parameter \(\sigma_{0}\) in (6) on 25% in order to achieve the agreement with the real data.

## 5 Conclusions

The electromagnetic energy resolution has been studied. We have determined the statistical and constant terms for the electron energy resolution by fitting of the expressions \(\sigma/E=a/\sqrt{E}\oplus b\) and \(\sigma/E=a/\sqrt{E}+b\) to the obtained data. The parameters for the quadratic fit are equal to \(a=29\pm 1.6\) % \(\sqrt{GeV}\), \(b=3\pm 0.4\) at \(\theta=20^{o}\) and \(a=22\pm 1\) % \(\sqrt{GeV}\), \(b=2.3\pm 0.3\) at \(\theta=90^{o}\). For the linear fit the ones are \(a=24.2\pm 0.5\), \(b=1.8\pm 0.1\) for \(\theta=20^{o}\) and \(a=18.6\pm 0.6\), \(b=1.3\pm 0.1\) for \(\theta=90^{o}\).

We have compared our results on energy resolution with the Monte Carlo based parametrization. Good agreement is observed for the linear fit.
