###### Abstract

In this note the analysis of electron and pion test beam data of the hadronic endcap calorimeter is described. The data have been taken with the HEC prototype modules in September 1996. The calorimeter response and resolution are determined for a beam energy range from 20 to 200 GeV. In the pion analysis four different methods were applied to account for hardware problems and energy leakage. The results are compared with the predictions of detailed Monte Carosimulations.

## 1 Introduction

The prototype modules of the hadronic endcap calorimeter for ATLAS (HEC) have been tested during three test beam periods in 1996. During a run in September four modules have been installed to measure the energy of hadronic showers in the energy range up to 200 GeV. Test beam data with electrons, pions and muons have been accumulated. This allows an estimate of the calorimeter response and energy resolution for electrons and pions. Impact position scans have been performed to study the homogeneity of the calorimeter response.

Four different hadron analyses have been performed, and are presented here briefly. For a discussion of the details see Ref. [1]. To overcome the deficiencies in the data, namely the lack of an electronic calibration, dead electronic channels and energy leakage from the calorimeter, each analysis uses additional calibration constants, that have been determined by optimizing the energy resolution. The four analyses apply different methods that, by their very nature, give different emphasis to the correction of these deficiencies.

In Section 2 some experimental details are given and the data sample used in the analysis is presented. The analyses of electron and pion data are presented in Section 3 and Section 4 together with a detailed comparison of the experimental data with predictions from Monte Carlo calculations.

## 2 Experimental Setup and Data Samples

### Test Beam Setup

The measurements have been performed in the H6 beam line of SPS, with the calorimeter prototype installed in the H1 cryostat. In the beam line trigger counters, multi-wire proportional chambers and Cherenkov detectors have been installed. They provide the trigger information, particle impact point position and some particle identification. Details can be found in Ref. [2].

The hadronic endcap prototype consists of four modules, which represent 1/16th of the future ATLAS LAr hadronic endcap calorimeter. A schematic layout of the modules is presented in Figs. 1 and 2. The modules are split into two azimuthal sectors A andB. These modules are identical, except the high voltage distribution is implemented with high resistive coating in module A, and by copper pads, connected by \(\approx\)1 M\(\Omega\) resistors in module B. Longitudinally the prototype is subdivided into five readout segments, each having the same thickness. The total thickness of the calorimeter is 7.3 hadronic interaction lengths. The stack has been rotated by the angle of 18.772\({}^{\circ}\), in order that the beam enters the calorimeter at an angle equivalent to a rapidity of \(\eta\)=1.8 in the ATLAS setup.

The coordinate system and the numbering scheme of the calorimeter cells and the corresponding ADC channels are described in detail in Ref. [3]. In Fig. 2 a schematic view of the prototype front face with its cell structure and the ADC channel numbers are given.

Each of the five readout segments of the calorimeter module consists of eight argon gaps, each with an EST readout scheme, as described in Ref. [4]. The EST structure subdivides each gap into four sub-gaps, which have a separate high voltage supply. During

the September run, two of the four sub-gaps in the third longitudinal segment of module A had to be disconnected from the high voltage. This reduces the signal in these gaps by 50%.

### Data Samples

The pion data accumulated, were taken at the following beam energies: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 150 and 200 GeV. The electron data cover the energy interval from 20 to 100 GeV. Typical statistics for each energy point is 6000 events for electrons, and about 10000 or 20000 events for pions. Data have been taken predominantly at two different impact positions in the center of cell 9 and 90 (see Fig. 2).

Randomly triggered events have been used for the determination of the pedestals of the ADCs. For each readout channel, the mean value and the r.m.s. value of the distribution of ADC counts have been determined, stored and used to compute the pedestal subtracted ADC values for real events. Also the stability of the pedestals has been checked and found to be within a band of a few ADC counts.

Due to the poor efficiency of the Cherenkov detector, it has not been used to discriminate between pions and electrons. This results in some electron contamination in the low energy pion sample, which has to be corrected for in the analyses.

Electron Data Analysis

To reconstruct the electron energy, the individual energies in a cluster of five cells are summed. The size of the cluster has been optimized in Ref. [2]. The same cluster definition is used in the current analysis, which means that only energies deposited in the first two readout segments of the calorimeter are used, with three cells in the first and two cells in the second readout segment.

In order to convert the measured ADC values into calibrated energies, only one global calibration constant, \(\alpha_{em}\), is used. This calibration constant is determined from a global minimization procedure, in which all events at all beam energies are taken into account. The function that is minimized is

\[\chi^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{N_{run}}\sum_{j=1}^{n_{events}}\frac{(\alpha_{em}\ SADC_{i,j}-E_{0}^{i})^{2}}{ \sigma_{i}^{2}}, \tag{1}\]

where \(SADC_{i,j}\) corresponds to the sum of ADC counts in the selected cluster for event \(j\) in run \(i\), \(E_{0}^{i}\) is the nominal beam energy for run \(i\). The sums are extended over all events in a given run and over all runs. The factors \(\sigma_{i}\) are used to assign different weights to the individual runs. They correspond to the resolution at the corresponding energy. Approximate values have been used in a first iteration. After applying this constant to all electron runs, the energy distributions at each electron energy are obtained. The shapes of these distributions can be well described by Gaussians. The calorimeter response and resolution are determined by the mean values and standard deviations obtained by fitting these distributions.

The energy dependence of the calorimeter response is shown in Fig. 3. A flat behaviour is found, with deviations from unity which do not exceed \(\pm 0.5\%\).

The Monte Carlo simulation results are also presented in Fig. 3. The data simu

## 4 Pion Data Analysis

Due to the deficiencies of the setup, obtaining any quantitative value for the energy resolution is highly problematic. For this reason, in this note, we summarize the essential aspects of the four analyses undertaken by the HEC group, leaving details to separate notes [1].

### Four Approaches for the Data Analysis

Four methods (I to IV) for the pion data processing have been used to overcome the difficulties with the data. Each analysis starts with the correction of the calorimeter signal in accordance with the known hardware problems. The different analyses apply some cuts to remove electrons from the pion sample.

The major features of the analyses are:

* This analysis has only five free parameters, one for each readout segment (\(j\)). There is no energy dependence to these parameters \(c_{j}\). For the selection of the cluster, a sigma and readout segment dependent noise cut has been

The energy resolution is shown as a function of the nominal beam energy, a fit of the resolution to the formula (2) is superimposed._applied. To obtain the five calibration constants, the following function is minimized:

\[F=\sum_{i=2}^{8}\frac{1}{N_{{}_{ev}}}\sum_{1}^{N_{{}_{ev}}}\frac{(E_{{}_{m\,{}_{ ens}}}^{i}-E_{0}^{i})^{2}}{\sigma_{i}^{2}},\]

where \(E_{{}_{m\,{}_{ess}}}^{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{5}c_{j}\cdot\sum_{k=1}^{N_{j}}ADC_{k,j},\ N_{j}\) is the number of relevant cells in the \(j\)th readout segment, \(ADC_{k,j}\) is number of ADC counts and \(\sigma_{i}\) corresponds to the width of the related energy distribution. This analysis does not use the 20 GeV data. The noise has been estimated by summing the ADC values of the random trigger events using those cells which have been selected for the'real' data. In order to obtain the values of the sampling and constant terms of the energy resolution, this noise has been subtracted from the width of the energy distribution at each energy point.
**Analysis**:
* In this analysis one calibration constant is used for each calorimeter readout cell utilized. As a fixed cluster of 36 cells is used for every event, this analysis uses 36 free parameters, with no energy dependence. To obtain the calibration constants, the following function is minimized: \[F=\sum_{k=1}^{8}\frac{1}{N_{k}}\sum_{i}^{N_{k}}(E_{0}^{\,k}-\sum_{j}\alpha_{j} E_{ij})^{2},\] where \(E_{0}^{\,k}\) is the \(k\)-th nominal beam energy, \(N_{k}\) is the number of events taken at this energy, \(i\) is an event number, \(j\) is the readout cell number with the assigned calibration coefficient \(c_{j}\) and \(E_{ij}\) is the energy detected in the \(i\)-th event in the \(j\)-th readout cell. The coefficient \(1/N_{k}\) takes into account the difference in the statistics at various beam energies. Due to the minimization function, not being divided by the expected resolution, this analysis optimizes the energy resolution preferentially at high energies. The use of an individual calibration constant per readout cell allows the correction of longitudinal and lateral leakage, as well as gain differences between the cells. Since the calibration constants are not energy dependent, as is the leakage, the correction is an average over all energies, but optimized for high energies.
**Analysis**:
* This analysis uses five readout segment dependent calibration constants. These constants depend on the beam energy. To obtain the calibration constants a minimization of the following expression, at every energy point, is performed: \[\chi^{\,2}=\sum_{i=1}^{n_{{}_{agent}}}\ \frac{(\alpha_{{}_{had}}\ \left(\sum_{j=1}^{5}c_{j}ADC_{j,i}\right)-E_{0})^{2}}{\sigma^{\,2}}.\]\(ADC_{j,i}\) correspond to the sum of ADC counts in the pion cluster in the calorimeter readout segment \(j\) for the event \(i\), \(E_{0}\) is the nominal beam energy and \(\sigma\) is used as a normalization factor. It corresponds to the expected energy resolution at the given energy point. The energy dependence of the five calibration constants corrects mainly for longitudinal leakage. Lateral leakage and inter-calibration errors between cells are only corrected on average within a readout segment.
**Analysis**: For this analysis a neural network is utilized. The neurons have been organized in a feed-forward layered architecture with different number of neurons in each of the 4 layers (5-6-2-1 scheme with 5 inputs and 1 output). The input variables are the sums of ADC counts of the five readout segments. The output gives the measured energy.

For the net training a sub-set of data events has been used (\(\approx 30\%\) of the available statistics per energy point). The events are selected from within \(\pm 2\sigma\) around the central value of energy, which has been determined by analysis I. For this training the target value is the nominal beam energy. After this procedure, the neural network is applied to all data, including the events used for the training.

### Pion Energy Resolution and Response

Using the calibration coefficients for the four analyses, as described in the previous section, the hadronic shower energy distributions have been obtained for each pion energy. A Gaussian fit to these energy distributions gives the energy response and the resolution for each beam energy and for each analysis. These fits have been performed in the region of \(\pm 2\sigma\) around the central value. The pion energy resolution \(\sigma/E\) is shown in Fig. 5 for the whole set of events for the beam position corresponding to cell 90.

As in the electron case the energy resolution of the prototype calorimeter is fitted to the parametrization (2). The fitted values for the sampling (a), the constant (b) and the noise (c) terms are presented for each method in Fig. 5. The noise is given only for Analysis II as the noise contribution is not energy dependent in this approach. For the Analysis I III and IV the noise is a function of the beam energy, and the fit has been done after subtracting the estimated noise contribution at each energy point.

Three of the analyses (I, III and IV ) correct mainly for energy leakage. This is done either averaged over all energies (Analysis I and IV ), or with a more or less explicit energy dependence (Analysis III ) of the calibration constants. Due to the large number of free parameters Analysis II allows for a correction of energy leakage and inter-calibration between readout cells, but with a bias towards the high energy data.

The result of this is, that Analysis II achieves a better resolution than the other three. The resolution of Analysis III is inferior compared to Analysis I and IV because of the noise cut applied in the latter analyses.

### Comparison with Monte Carlo Simulations

A comparison between data and Monte Carlo simulations has been performed for analysis II and III, where the simulated data has been analyzed in a similar way as for the real data.

Three sets of Monte Carlo data, simulated with the HEC test-beam Monte Carlo software version 2[5] are used for comparison with the pion data at eight energy points in the range of 20 to 200 GeV. The setup simulated is similar to the electron Monte Carlo (version 1[5]), except for some additional leakage detectors to monitor the kinetic energy of particles leaving the modules. The beam enters at an impact position corresponding to cell 90. With the Monte Carlo 2000 events at each energy point have been simulated, using three different hadronic shower models (GCALOR, GHEISHA and GFLUKA) available in GEANT 3. In analysis II only 1000 events have been used. In order to obtain a more realistic simulation, the known defects of module A are accounted for by applying appropriate correction factors to the visible energies. The following is taken into account:

Figure 5: _Pion energy resolution obtained in the four methods. The values of sampling (a), constant (b) and noise (c) terms are shown for all methods._

**Readout segment 2**: A preamplifier in the 8th gap of cell 104 was dead (only analysis II)
**Readout segment 3**: - two sub-gaps (out of 4) in each gap did not hold high voltage; - a sensitive pad in the second gap of cell 118 was disconnected; - a sensitive pad in the third gap of cell 120 was disconnected; - only one sub-gab was operable in the 6th gap;

In the analyses, first a global scaling factor is extracted to convert the visible energy in the Monte Carlo to the scale of ADC-counts in the real data. This allows measured noise to be included.

In Fig. 6 the pion energy resolution, obtained with analysis III, is shown for three different hadronic shower models. For comparison the resolution obtained from the test-beam data is superimposed. The best agreement is obtained with the GCALOR model. The GHEISHA simulation tends to predict a too pessimistic and the FLUKA model a too optimistic energy resolution.

The points represent the results from the test-beam data._Fig. 7 compares the results of the Monte Carlo and test beam data, processed with analysis II. While it should be remembered, that, due to leakage, strong conclusions on the comparison between data and Monte Carlo should not be drawn. However, remarkably good agreement is obtained between the data and GCALOR.

Fig. 8 shows the Monte Carlo results for analyses II and III for the GCALOR shower model. In addition the expectation of the energy resolution from GCALOR (Analysis III) is shown, when the leakage energy is added to the measured energy in the calorimeter prototype (with an appropriate scaling factor). In this case a sampling term of about 70% and a constant term of 3% is predicted by the GCALOR shower model. The results indicate, that a better pion energy resolution could be achieved with the present design of the calorimeter, if the complete absorption of the hadronic showers would be achieved.

## 5 Conclusions

An analysis of electron and pion test beam data of the hadronic endcap calorimeter prototype has been performed.

For electrons the results obtained for the calorimeter response and the resolution, agree well with the expectations from Monte Carlo simulations for cell 90. The sampling term is found to be of the order of 20% with a constant term of the order of 1.0%.

For pions the four different analysis approaches give similar results. Due to the deficiencies of the setup, obtaining any quantitative value for the energy resolution is highly problematic, and should await analysis of data, with a reasonable shower containment.

The results obtained on the energy resolution are best described by predictions of the GCALOR hadronic shower model. The other models tend to give too optimistic (G-FLUKA) or too pessimistic (GHEISHA) values. Also Monte Carlo simulations (GCALOR) show, that if the complete absorption of the hadronic showers would be provide d, we would expect, for Analysis III, a pion energy resolution of about 70% (sampling term) and a constant term of about 3%.
