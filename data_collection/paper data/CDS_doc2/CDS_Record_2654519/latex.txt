## 1 Introduction

Flavour-changing neutral currents (FCNC) have played a significant role in the construction of the Standard Model of particle physics (SM). These processes are forbidden at tree level and can proceed only via loops, hence are characterized by small amplitudes. An important set of FCNC processes involves the decays of \(b\)-quark to \(s\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) final states mediated by electroweak box and penguin diagrams. Non-SM particles - even heavier than what can be directly probed with existing colliders - may contribute to FCNC decay amplitudes, affecting the measurement of observables related to the decay under study.

The \(B_{d}^{0}\to K^{*0}(892)\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decay is a semileptonic decay mediated by FCNC. 1 The observables sensitive to contributions from physics beyond the SM include the differential branching fraction, charge and isospin asymmetries, the angular distribution of decay products and - for some contributions that are lepton-flavour dependent - the ratio of decay rates into dimuon and dielectron final states.

Footnote 1: Hereafter, the \(K^{*0}(892)\) is referred to as \(K^{*}\) and charge conjugation is implied throughout, unless stated otherwise.

The kinematics of the four particles in the final state of \(B_{d}^{0}\to K^{*}(K\pi)\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) is described by the invariant mass of the dimuon system (\(q^{2}\)) and three helicity angles. The full angular differential decay rate can then be expressed as a function of \(q^{2}\), helicity angles, seven angular coefficients \(S_{i}\) and the fraction of longitudinally polarised \(K^{*}\) mesons, \(F_{L}\). Folding transformations based on symmetry of trigonometric functions can be used to simplify the distributions reducing the dependence to only on three parameters: \(F_{L}\), \(S_{3}\) and one of \(S_{4}\), \(S_{5}\), \(S_{7}\) and \(S_{8}\). A set of optimised parameters \(P_{i}^{(\prime)}\) was also proposed [1; 2] to reduce the theoretical uncertainties that come from hadronic form factors. The \(P_{i}^{(\prime)}\) parameters can be derived from the measured values of \(S_{i}\) and \(F_{L}\). The sign of \(S_{5}\) and \(S_{8}\) parameters depends on the flavour of the \(B_{d}^{0}\) meson. Incorrect flavour tag assignment (mistag) thus leads to dilution effects.

The parameters of the angular distribution for \(B_{d}^{0}\to K^{*}\mu\mu\) with a subsequent \(K^{*}\to K^{+}\pi^{-}\) decay have been measured recently by the Babar, Belle, CDF, CMS, LHCb and ATLAS collaborations [3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12]. The LHCb collaboration reported a potential hint of deviation from SM predictions [6] using their Run 1 dataset. The results from the Belle collaboration [10], CMS [8] and ATLAS analysis of 2012 data [12] are consistent with both the LHCb results and with the SM calculations.

This document presents an estimate of the precision that ATLAS could achieve in measurement of the same angular parameters using the dataset expected to be collected at the HL-LHC. This estimate is based on the extrapolation of the ATLAS result found in Ref. [12] and takes into account the extrapolated numbers of signal and background events as well as the expected improvements in mass resolution.

## 2 Assumptions of the projections

The core of the \(B_{d}^{0}\to K^{*}\mu\mu\) analysis is an extended unbinned maximum likelihood fit (UML) to the decay angles and the \(B_{d}^{0}\) invariant mass (binned in the \(q^{2}\) observable).

Monte Carlo simulations (toy-MC) are employed to estimate the ATLAS precision at HL-LHC in the \(B_{d}^{0}\to K^{*}\mu\mu\) analysis. Toy-MC parameters include the extrapolated number of signal (\(N_{\rm sig}\)) and background (\(N_{\rm bck}\)) events at the HL-LHC, and the effect of the performance of the ATLAS Upgrade tracker (ITK) [13]. The latter namely including the improvement in the 4-prong invariant mass resolutions, as studied with the \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\)[14] decay channel.

\(N_{\rm sig}\) and \(N_{\rm bck}\) are extrapolated from the simulations and the real data of the Run 1 \(B_{d}^{0}\to K^{*}\mu\mu\) analysis [12]. Three dimuon trigger scenarios are considered, with varying muons \(p_{\rm T}\) thresholds: a high-yield one requiring 6 GeV \(p_{\rm T}\) cuts on both muons, the intermediate one requiring in addition at least one of the muons to have \(p_{\rm T}\) above 10 GeV, and a low-statistics scenario requiring both muons to have \(p_{\rm T}\) above 10 GeV. Hereafter the scenarios are referred as \(\mu 6\mu 6\), \(\mu 10\mu 6\) and \(\mu 10\mu 10\). The offline selection and reconstruction efficiencies are assumed to be similar to the ones observed in the Run 1 analysis.

The analysis of the simulated sample follows exactly the same fit model as in the Run 1 analysis as well as the same \(q^{2}\) range and binning. A dilution correction due to \(B_{d}^{0}\) flavor mistagging is applied assuming an effect identical to what measured in Run 1. While the trigger thresholds would have an effect on the detector angular acceptance shapes, their effect on the resulting precision is limited and thus same acceptance shape as in Run 1 is used.

## 3 Event yields

The extrapolation of the event yields is based on the measured signal and background yields of the Run 1 analysis (using 20.3 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV). It accounts for the total integrated luminosity expected at HL-LHC (3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)), the increase of the production cross-section of \(b\)-hadrons between 8 and 14 TeV (1.7\(\times\) according to Ref. [15]) and the expected trigger efficiencies.

The signal trigger efficiencies for the three trigger scenarios are extracted from the Run 1 simulation of the \(B_{d}^{0}\to K^{*}\mu\mu\) decay, emulating the trigger thresholds with offline muon \(p_{\rm T}\) cuts individually for each \(q^{2}\) bin. The background rejection in the various trigger scenarios is measured on events from the Run 1 data sidebands (\(4.9\) GeV \(<m(B_{d}^{0})<5.058\) GeV and \(5.498\) GeV \(<m(B_{d}^{0})<5.7\) GeV).

The extrapolated signal event yields are shown in the third column of Table 1. The signal to background ratios for the \(q^{2}\) bins and trigger configurations range between 0.4 and 1.2 (not significantly different from the Run 1 measurement). Due to the low event yields in the Run 1 analysis, all the projected \(N_{\rm sig}\) and \(N_{\rm bck}\) suffer from statistical uncertainties up to \(\sim 25\%\).

## 4 Toy-MC simulations and results

The precision on the angular parameters is extracted using toy-MC simulations. The toy-MC and consequent UML fits in \(q^{2}\) bins follow exactly the same configuration as in Run 1: three \(q^{2}\) bins are analyzed: \([0.04,2.0]\) GeV\({}^{2}\), \([2.0,4.0]\) GeV\({}^{2}\)\([4.0,6.0]\) GeV\({}^{2}\). The same four folding transformations as in Run 1 are applied to the generated toy-MC data and correspondingly simplified angular distributions are fitted [12]. A two step fit is run: \(B_{d}^{0}\) invariant mass only first to fix the mass background shape and signal fraction, followed by the simultaneous mass-angular fit. In the toy-MC generation phase, the signal angular distribution is set to follow the theory prediction (DHMV [16]). The detector acceptance and the background shapes are set same as in the Run 1 analysis. The signal mass distribution is narrowed w.r.t. the Run 1 analysis, corresponding to the ITk improvement in the mass resolution: the HL-LHC simulations of the \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) decay [14] channels show that the ITk improves resolution in the reconstructed 4-prong invariant mass by 30%.

Table 1 summarizes the projected statistical uncertainties on the angular parameters, as extracted from the fits to the generated toy-MC data. Ten toy-MC fits are run and the average statistical uncertainty out of

these ten fits is reported in the Table 1. The toy-MC does not include effect of mistagging. In the Run 1 analysis, a post-fit correction has been applied to the UML fit results, affecting both the central values and the uncertainties of the \(P^{\prime}_{5}\) and \(P^{\prime}_{8}\) parameters. Following the same procedure, a dilution correction corresponding to a mistag fraction of 10% is applied to the \(P^{\prime}_{5}\) and \(P^{\prime}_{8}\) uncertainties.

The procedure of folding leads to replacement of a single UML fit to the full angular distribution, by four fits to four simplified angular distributions. Out of each of these four fits, \(F_{L}\), \(P_{1}\) and \(P^{(\prime)}_{i}\) are extracted, with \(P^{(\prime)}_{i}\) corresponding to \(P^{\prime}_{4}\), \(P^{\prime}_{5}\), \(P^{\prime}_{6}\) or \(P^{\prime}_{8}\). Therefore the values and uncertainties of the \(F_{L}\) and \(P_{1}\) parameters are ambiguous. The ambiguity is resolved by using the highest average statistical uncertainty out of these four fits.

## 5 Systematic uncertainties

All the systematic uncertainties considered in the Run 1 analysis have the potential to be improved with higher statistics of the data collected at HL-LHC:

* Fit-model systematic uncertainties rely on the precision of the model, which is determined with simulations and sidebands data. Thus will be better constrained with the larger HL-LHC dataset, approximately scaling by \(1/\sqrt{L_{\rm int}}\).
* Similarly, systematics due to individual background modes will be better measured and simulated at the HL-LHC. These systematics are assumed to reduce as \(1/\sqrt{L_{\rm int}}\). This assumption is quite conservative, since the Run 1 analysis accounted for these background components by studying the variation in the fit result when including or excluding the corresponding fit models or events in the dataset: potential room for improvement could come from a more careful evaluation of these systematic effects.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c|c c c c c c} \hline \hline LHC phase & \(q^{2}\) [GeV\({}^{2}\)] & \(N_{\rm sig}\pm\delta^{\rm stat}_{N_{\rm sig}}\) & \(\delta^{\rm stat}_{F_{L}}\) & \(\delta^{\rm stat}_{P_{1}}\) & \(\delta^{\rm stat}_{P_{4}^{\prime}}\) & \(\delta^{\rm stat}_{P_{5}^{\prime}}\) & \(\delta^{\rm stat}_{P_{6}^{\prime}}\) & \(\delta^{\rm stat}_{P_{8}^{\prime}}\) \\ \hline Run 1 & \([0.04,2.0]\) & \(128\pm 22\) & 0.08 & 0.30 & 0.40 & 0.26 & 0.21 & 0.48 \\  & \([2.0,4.0]\) & \(106\pm 23\) & 0.11 & 0.51 & 0.31 & 0.31 & 0.28 & 0.41 \\  & \([4.0,6.0]\) & \(114\pm 24\) & 0.13 & 0.43 & 0.33 & 0.35 & 0.27 & 0.42 \\ \hline HL-

This approach yields the HL-LHC systematic uncertainties shown in Table 2. Compared to the statistical uncertainties in Table 1, this shows that the analysis is not dominated by the systematic uncertainties, with few exceptions where at most the systematics is \(\sim 1.6\times\) larger than the statistical precision. The HL-LHC result is expected to benefit from less conservative estimates of the dominant systematic uncertainties, and will thus likely be still limited by statistical uncertainties in all cases.

The projected statistical precision and the systematical uncertainties in measuring the angular parameters in the \(B_{d}^{0}\to K^{*}\mu\mu\) analysis at HL-LHC are presented in Figure 1 and summarized in Table 3.

Figure 1: Projected ATLAS HL-LHC measurement precision in the \(F_{L}\), \(P_{1}\), \(P_{4}^{\prime}\), \(P_{5}^{\prime}\), \(P_{6}^{\prime}\) and \(P_{8}^{\prime}\) parameters for the intermediate \(\upmu 10\upmu 6\) trigger scenario compared to the ATLAS Run 1 measurement. Alongside theory predictions (CFFMPSV [19], DHMV [16], JC [20]) are also shown. Both the projected statistical and the total (statistical and systematic) uncertainties are shown. While the HL-LHC toy-MC were generated with the DHMV central values of the \(F_{L}\) and \(P_{i}^{(\prime)}\) parameters, in these plots the central values are moved to the ATLAS Run 1 measurement for better visualization of the improvement in the precision.

## 6 Conclusions

The precision of the measurement of the angular parameters in the \(B_{d}^{0}\to K^{*0}(892)\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decay at the upgraded ATLAS detector at High-Luminosity LHC is presented. The projections extrapolate signal and background yields observed in Run 1 and employ toy-MC simulations and consequent fit to the decay angular distributions split in three \(q^{2}\) bins in the range \([0.04,6.0]\)\(\text{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}^{2}\). The toy-MC generation accounts for the improved performance of the ATLAS Upgrade tracking system and for the estimate of the expected number of signal and background events at the HL-LHC. Three trigger scenarios, affecting the signal yields, are considered, providing high-yield, intermediate and low-statistics estimates. Using the same \(q^{2}\) binning as the Run 1 analysis, the precision in measuring a representative \(P_{5}^{\prime}\) parameter is expected to improve by factors of \(\sim 9\times\), \(\sim 8\times\), \(\sim 5\times\) (correspondingly in the three trigger scenarios) relative to the Run 1 measurement.
