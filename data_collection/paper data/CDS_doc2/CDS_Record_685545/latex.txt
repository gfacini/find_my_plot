## 1 - Introduction

This document refers to the studies done for bakeout conditions in the VA region of the beam pipe and the cooling solutions to deal with it.

Several simulations were performed, using finite element software ANSYS to compute thermal behaviour of the LAr EC beam pipe in the cryostat and the shielding region. To check the simulation results several tests using a beam pipe prototype were carried out.

The aim of the cooling system is to assure that the temperature in the most exigent regions does not exceed the specified limits (below 80\({}^{\circ}\)C at the Inner cryostat wall and the shielding inner cover), because of possible thermal stresses generated by concentrated high temperature gradients.

The geometry of the cooling circuit should also take into consideration the availability of space to run cooling pipes, assembly procedures and geometrical constraints.

Fig. 1- Cooling loops in the Beam pipe forward regionThe bakeout process permits the outgassing, that is a relevant aspect for experiment success. The Ion desorption yields are sensitive to vacuum chamber cleanliness.

The bakeout cycle consists of a step where the temperature is increased at a constant slope (50\({}^{\circ}\)C/hour), a step of 24 hours at 250\({}^{\circ}\)C, and a final step of decreasing temperature with a constant slope.

It is important to assure that during and after the bakeout, no mechanical and thermal stresses are generated, being only possible assuring a good control of the temperatures.

It is proposed to have two independent cooling loops (see fig.1), one cooling the JM region and one cooling the LAr cryostat internal wall.

The advantages of having two independent systems consist in a simpler thermal management, lower pressure difference, easier installation, decoupling of the schedules of the LAr and the JM as well as better definition of the responsibility.

The cooling systems should assure the following:

* Bakeout in closed and open position.
* Max temp of the Cryostat wall below 80\({}^{\circ}\)C. (This limit is derived from the fact that large mechanical and/or thermal stresses should be avoided on the LAr vessel, especially near the O-ring region.
* Max temperature of the JM shield should not exceed 80\({}^{\circ}\)C.

This study permits a comparison between the calculated pressure drops (theoretical formulas), and the real achieved pressure drops in the tests. It is an important parameter to decide the water flow in the circuits to be compatible with LAr electronics boxes cooling system from which these two cooling loops will be supplied.

## 2 - Cryostat Region

In the Cryostat region, the first studies were done taking into consideration a double wall SSbeam pipe, but after some R&D the general idea is to go for a single wall pipe as represented in Fig.2. The main reasons are:

* Reduction in Muon background in the order of 25% in the critical forward region.
* Cost (cheaper to produce)
* Simpler mechanically

The analyzed proposals resulted from several iterations widely discussed between all interested parties. The results of these discussions are summarized in the ECR "Single Wall SS VA Beam pipe" EDMS nr ATL-VA-EC-0001.

The highest heat flux from the beam pipe to the cryostat region is expected in the flange region, so this region was taken for detailed studies. Taking into account the previously made simulations (chapter 2.1) the assumptions and boundary conditions were applied as described in chapter 2.2.

Figure 2: Modification of the flange with cooling pipes passages

### Previous simulations

The first simulations in Ansys were done for the geometry as showed in Fig.3, being the finite element model reduced to as showed in Fig.4, assuming a transversal symmetry (geometrical and boundary conditions):

It was applied a constant temperature of 250\({}^{0}\)C, on the inner surface of the beam pipe, a constant temperature of 18\({}^{0}\)C in the cooling pipe, and adiabatic conditions in the cryostat outer wall.

For these conditions, the cryostat outer wall temperature was simulated to be around 30\({}^{0}\)C. this value will be used as boundary condition for the future model.

### Actual Model for simulations

Materials, their thermal properties and boundary conditions are shown below. The following geometry for the beam pipe in the VA Region was taken into consideration:

Beam Pipe:

* Diameter (Inner/Outer) = 58/60 mm
* Material = Aluminium
* Temperature \({}^{(1)}=\)250 \({}^{\circ}\)C

Insulation Wall:

* Thickness = 10 mm
* Material = Aerogel

Cryostat inner Warm Pipe:

* Diameter (Inner/Outer) = 94/100 mm
* Material = Aluminium
* Temperature \({}^{(2)}=\)30\({}^{\circ}\)C

Flange:

1 For the calculation it is assumed that at z=\(\pm\) 50mm from the flange, temperature of the beam pipe is fixed (250\({}^{\circ}\)C).

2 For the calculation it is assumed that at z=\(\pm\) 300mm from the flange temperature of the Inner cryostat wall is fixed (30\({}^{\circ}\)C).

Figure 6: Flange region Layout and model parameters

\begin{tabular}{|c l|} \hline _ATLAS Project Document No:_ & _Page:_ 8 \(\mathrm{\sigma}\) 25 \\ \hline  & _Rev._ No.: **0** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The simulation of the temperature distribution was made using a Finite Elements Analysis (ANSYS) assuming the following properties of the materials.

* Aluminium; k = 190 W/m. K
* Stainless Steel; k = 50 W/m K
* Aerogel; k = 0. 015 W/m K
* Air; k = 0. 023 W/m K

The same values were used in previous studies.

In order to reduce computing time and to simplify geometry the beam axial symmetry and the plane symmetry passing through the middle of the flange were assumed

In this first approach only the heat transfer by conduction was taken into consideration (because the convection coefficient is very small due to the small interspace left free for the air). The radiation analysis will be made using - as an input to the calculations - the results of the temperature distribution (iterative method).

### - Temperature Distribution

In figures 7 and 8 one can see the temperature distributions around the flange region:

### - Temperature Profile

The temperature profile along the Cryostat inner Warm Pipe is shown below:

As it shown in Fig. 9 the Cryostat inner warm temperature is below 52\({}^{\rm o}\)C which is a value inside the limit of 80\({}^{\rm o}\)C.

Figure 7: Temp. Distribution - Flange Region Figure 8: Temp Distribution - Flange Region Detail

### - Radiation Analysis

In order to simplify the model for a radiation analysis, the data from the presented above temperature profiles were read out and worked in terms of average. This means:

Average Cryostat Inner Warm Pipe Temperature is: 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C

Average Insulation Wall Temperature is: 120 \({}^{\circ}\)C

Than, the heat amount transferred by radiation from the insulation wall to the cryostat inner warm pipe was calculated, according to a theoretical approach for a Special Diffuse Two-Surface Enclosure.

The best approximation is: to a long concentric cylinder, and the heat transferred by the radiation from the inner cylinder to the outer cylinder is:

\[Q_{12}=\frac{\sigma\left(T_{1}^{4}-T_{2}^{4}\right)}{\frac{1}{ \epsilon_{1}}+\frac{1-\epsilon_{2}}{\epsilon_{2}}\left(\frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}} \right)}\pi.D_{1}.L\ \ \text{[W]}\]

Where:

\(\sigma\) - Stefan-Boltzmann constant [5.67 x 10\({}^{8}\) W/m\({}^{2}\).K\({}^{4}\)]

T\({}_{1}\) - Temperature of inner cylinder (Insulation Wall pipe).

T\({}_{2}\) - Temperature of outer cylinder (Cryostat Inner Warm Pipe).

r\({}_{1}\) - Radius of inner cylinder (Insulation Wall pipe) \(\approx\) 0.040 m.

r\({}_{2}\) - Radius of outer cylinder (Cryostat Inner Warm Pipe) \(\approx\) 0.047 m.

\(\epsilon_{1}\) - Emissivity of inner cylinder (Insulation Wall pipe).

\(\epsilon_{2}\) - Emissivity of outer cylinder (Cryostat Inner Warm Pipe).

In order to determine the range of possible radiation influence, two calculations were made, one assuming emissivity factor 1 (conservative) and one with the values near the reality.

In the conservative approach we used \(\epsilon_{1}=1\) (insulation as ideal radiation emitter-black body), \(\epsilon_{2}=0,1\) (conservative value for aluminium).

In the real approach we used \(\epsilon_{1}=0,07\) (Aerogel insulation is covered with a layer of aluminium foil ideal radiation emitter-black body), \(\epsilon_{2}=0,07\) (cryostat inner warm pipe is polished and works as a foil).

Thus the heat transferred by radiation from the Insulation Wall cylinder to the Cryostat Inner Warm Pipe is:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline _ATLAS Project Document No:_ & _Page: 11 of 25_ \\ \hline  & _Rev. No.: **0**_ \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline Conservative approach \\ \hline Q\({}_{12}\) = 23,5 W/meter of pipe \\ Real Approach \\ \hline Q\({}_{12}\) = 7,9 W/meter of pipe \\ It is estimated that the heat exchanged by radiation from the Cryostat Inner Warm Pipe to the LAr is in the order of 3,7 W/m (11,9 W/m\({}^{2}\))\({}^{3}\). \\ So it is possible to simulate in the model an additional heat load resulting from the radiation on the Cryostat Inner warm pipe by: \\ Q\({}_{12}\) = 19,7 W/meter of pipe for the conservative approach \\ Q\({}_{12}\) = 4,2 W/meter of pipe for the real approach \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\({}^{3}\) This value is achieved taking into account the data supplied by (Pierre Pailler). It is estimated that with a reference temperature for the Cryostat Inner Warm Pipe, and LAr wall of 393\({}^{\circ}\)K and 300\({}^{\prime}\)K respectively, the heat flux exchanged by radiation is 10 W/m\({}^{2}\).

### - Temperature Distribution (with radiation)

The methodology was to simulate first the "conservative approach" and check if the results were within the specified limits.

In figures 11 and 12 one can see the temperature distributions (with radiation):

### - Temperature Profile (with radiation)

As one can see the Cryostat inner wall temperature does not exceed 62\({}^{\circ}\)C (52 \({}^{\circ}\)C without radiation see Fig.9). It is still a value well inside the limit of 80 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]

### - The ANSYS Model for the cooling loop in JM region

The cooling pipe will be a coil near the JM inner cover (3mm thick aluminum wall), a good contact should be an advantage. Demineralized water at a temperature in the order of 18\({}^{0}\)C is used as a cooling liquid.

Due to a periodic symmetry and in order to save solving time, the model was simplified to the lowest symmetry; this means only one coil was simulated.

Figure 16: Geometry of the cooling pipe

Parameters:

The thermal properties of the materials are the same as for the Cryostat region (see section 2.2).

(4) -Although the temperature of the water will be in the order of 18\({}^{\circ}\)C, 20\({}^{\circ}\)C was taken to simulate the increase of temperature inside the pipe (conservative).

## 4 Beam PIPE MOCK-UP COOLING TEST

The aim of this test is to check the performance of the cooling system during the "bakeout" conditions. The temperature on the cryostat wall should not exceed 80\({}^{\circ}\)C. In previous simulations made in ANSYS the cooling system was able to maintain the cryostat wall in a temperature range of 30\({}^{\circ}\)C. This test is to check this result.

### The Model

The model to test is a 1 meter mock-up of the LAr EC beam pipe in the Cryostat region, constituted by:

* Beam Pipe 1 meter length
* Heaters placed along the inner surface of the pipe (simulating "bakeout" conditions)
* Insulation sheet (10mm aerogel), wrapped around the beam pipe.
* Cryostat inner wall
* Cooling circuit (2 coils embedded in the cryostat wall).

The measurement equipment:

Figure 22: Test Layout

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline _ATLAS Project Document No:_ & _Page: 18 of 25_ \\ \hline  & _Rev._ No.: \(0\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* 1 Voltmeter
* 6 temperature probes (4 placed in the inner wall of the beam pipe, 2 in the outer surface of the cryostat wall)
* 1 thermometer for surface temperature measurements (with pointer)
* 2 pressure manometers
* 1 flow meter
* 1 Infrared Thermo-imaging Camera

The heaters are placed along the beam pipe (inner surface), and their power can be adjusted with a voltmeter in such a way that it satisfies the bake-out conditions (the temperature in the beam pipe should be 250\({}^{\circ}\)C).

Four thermocouples are placed on the inner surface of the beam pipe.

Two thermocouples are placed on the outer surface of the cryostat wall.

In order to achieve the temperature profile around the cryostat pipe, a grid with 45 points evenly distributed was drawn on the mock-up as shown on the Fig.23.

Using an Infrared Thermograph Camera it was possible to capture images of the temperature distribution on the outside surface of the cryostat wall pipe.

Two cooling circuits are glued to the cryostat wall, but unfortunately only one of those circuits was running (the other was unfortunately blocked).

The bake-out conditions were simulated, adjusting the power dissipated by the beam pipe heaters, until the temperature inside the beam pipe became stable around 250\({}^{\circ}\)C (\(\pm\)3\({}^{\circ}\)C). This adjustment was done taking out readings from 4 thermocouples placed on the inner surface of the beam pipe.

Figure 23: Distribution of the 45 Points, for temperature measurement, around the cryostat wall.

### _-Bakeout conditions without cooling_

Once the steady conditions were achieved, temperature measurements in 45 points were accomplished, in order to have a temperatures distribution around the cryostat wall.

The central region of the pipe, where theoretically one must have only radial heat flux (the transversal heat flux, in the axial symmetry direction, should be zero), is the region that best characterizes the real conditions, where the beam pipe is much longer, assumed to have only radial heat transfer.

It is possible to see that the central region has higher temperatures, in the range of 58\({}^{0}\)C up to 62\({}^{\circ}\)C, this fluctuation being due to the natural convection around the cryostat wall.

In this situation the maximum registered temperature was around 62\({}^{0}\)C,

With the infrared camera similar results were achieved, temperatures around **54\({}^{\circ}\)C** in the central region of the pipe.

The difference between two measurements could result from the different conditions in the hall where the measurements were made.

### _-Stabilization Phase_

After starting the cooling system with a flow of 18 l/h, the temperature in the cryostat wall rapidly decreases to a temperature around 28\({}^{0}\)C.

The system requires around 15 minutes to stabilize at a temperature around 30 \({}^{0}\)C, as one can see in the following graphic representing a time dependent variation of the temperature of the cryostat wall.

The system requires around 15 minutes to stabilize at a temperature around 30 \({}^{0}\)C, as one can see in the following graphic representing a time dependent variation of the temperature of the cryostat wall.

### _-Bakeout conditions with cooling (18 l/h)_

After the temperature stabilization (steady conditions), with the cooling system running at 18 l/h and with water inlet temperature of 18\({}^{\mathrm{o}}\)C, the temperature of the cryostat wall decreases to around \(\mathbf{28^{o}C}\).

A pressure drop in the circuit in the order of \(\mathbf{180mbar}\) was registered.

Once the steady conditions were achieved, 45 temperature points were measured in order to have a temperature distribution of around the cryostat wall.

Similar results were achieved with the infrared camera, with temperatures around \(\mathbf{29^{o}C}\) in the central region of the pipe.

Figure 28: Temperature distribution according to TMP (with cooling)

Figure 29: Temperature distribution measured with infrared camera (with cooling \(\mathbf{18\,1/h}\))

### -Bakeout conditions with cooling (12 l/h)

Running the cooling system with a lower flow rate, **12 l/h**, the pressure loss decreases accordingly, a pressure difference of **100mbar** was measured between the inlet and outlet of the cooling circuit.

In this scenario the temperature in the cryostat wall increases to value around **33degC**, but it still remains very much inside the temperature limits.

## 5 - Comments

* The proposed cooling solutions for both regions satisfies the requirements
* The cryostat wall temperature, in the flange region, was calculated to be no higher than 62\({}^{\circ}\)C. Out of the flange region around 30\({}^{\circ}\)C.
* At the JM cover the maximal temperature was calculated to be below 30 \({}^{\circ}\)C. There is still a place to optimize the cooling pipe layout (decrease the length)
* The calculated pressure drops are inside reasonable limits:
* In the JM cover pressure drop is around 400mbar
* In the cryostat wall region pressure drop is in the order of 450mbar(@18 l/h).
* Tests results
* Temperature of the cryostat wall with one water cooling loop is in a range of 30\({}^{\circ}\)C (water flow between 12 and 18 l/min, water inlet temperature 18\({}^{\circ}\)C)
* Pressure drop along the cooling pipe 180 mbar for 18 l/min and 100 mbar for 12 l/min (for 1 m mock-up), thus for the real circuit it should be in the order of 450-250mbar
* There is a good agreement between the tests and simulations results.
* The proposed solution has sufficient safety margin
* The next steps:
* Build 2 meters long mockup end test it from mechanical and thermal point of view (including the flange region).
* Optimization of the cooling pipe layout in the JM region (perform tests and simulations).
* Finalize the engineering solution for the VA beam pipe cooling systems.
