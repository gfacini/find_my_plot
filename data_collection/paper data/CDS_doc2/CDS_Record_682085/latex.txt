**Abstract**

In this note, we describe the set of measurements and tests included in the provisional agreement on Quality Control in the ATLAS end-cap hadronic calorimeter.

Introduction

The Quality Control (QC) of the ATLAS end-cap hadronic calorimeter is a distributed task. At each site, different issues need to be addressed and tested. It is the responsibility of each production site to control and ensure its product quality, and to monitor the failure rates.

For each site, a list of possible tests has been discussed, and provisional agreement has been found on the required tests, and their distribution to the various sites.

Agreement has been found that we recognize three different categories of tests, that will be done: **T**(trivial), **U**(seful), or **R**(equired). The terms trivial and required are selfexplanatory. The term 'useful' is understood such, that these tests are mandatory at the start of production, but can be dropped, when the failure rate has been established to be low, and the site receiving the product under consideration agrees that the test can be omitted. In some cases, like for HV tests, monitoring the failure mode then becomes the responsibility of the receiving site. The tests described in the following sections will be labeled with one of the above characteristics.

We recognize the following sites.

* Copper plate production site
* HRL production site
* Honeycomb production site
* ROB and EST production site
* Stacking site
* Wheel assembly and installation site

As a general rule, for any test that is not a go-no-go test, it is proposed that the measured quantities will be recorded, and made public on WWW, for use in the subsequent stages of production.

## 2 Copper plate production site

The issues at this site are shape tolerances of the individual plates, thickness tolerance of the individual plates, flatness tolerance of the individual plates, copper surface integrity, safe handling, thread insert integrity, and cleanliness.

The following tests are proposed:

* Prior to mounting a copper plate:

**T:** Inspect the mill bed for metal chips Minimize the risk of damage to the surface of the copper plate, and the possibility of introducing metal chips to the plate surface. A visual inspection is sufficient.
* After machining:
* Check plate dimensions, including tolerances, notches, and holes in a go-no-go gauge This ensures that the copper plate has been manufactured to specification.
* Check the thread inserts after installation Check for damage. Screw in and unscrew at each thread insert.
* Check whether the edges of the copper plates and the screw holes are de-burred This is to ensure personnel safety during subsequent handling. A visual and manual inspection is sufficient.
* Measurement of plate weight (_sample_) Monitor density fluctuations (batch to batch). Sample the weight of the copper plates with a reference weight.
* Measurement of plate thickness at seven points Reconfirm thickness tolerance compliance. Save for later use in sampling frequency calculations. This can be done with a wide throat micrometer screw.
* Prior to packing:
* Inspect the surface of the copper plate and the threads for damage/slivers This is a "sanity check" for damage. A visual and manual inspection is sufficient.
* Check the copper plate surface for "reasonable" cleanliness Do a manual inspection.

Each copper plate should be stamped with a plate serial number, and a copper batch number.

## 3 HRL production site

The issues at this site are resistance of HRL compared to the specification, integrity of the HR layer, and shape of the HRL.

The following tests are proposed:* **R:** Local measurement of the resistance of the HRL This is to ensure, the material has been manufactured to specification. Test the local surface resistance of the material with an array of R-probes, say at seven locations close to the tie rods.
* **R:** Measurement of the resistance from outer to inner radius Check for major damage like cracks. This can be done by placing two line contacts along the outer and inner radius, and measuring the resistance with a simple DC R-meter.
* For resistive kapton:
* Check of the shape of the HRL A visual inspection before closing the gluing jig will do this.

## 4 Honeycomb production site

The issues at this site are cleanlyness, and the shape of the Honeycomb material with respect to the tolerances.

* **R:** Inspect dimensions in go-no-go gauge, _sample_ each batch Minimize complications during wheel assembly. A simple box frame equipped for height measurement can be used.
* **U:** HV test the material at 2.5 kV This is to minimize the chance of HV problems during stacking.

## 5 ROB and EST production site

The issues at this site are cleanliness of electrode pads, glue, and kapton prior to gluing, size of the inter electrode gaps, the resistance of the HRLs, the HV standoff at the edges, the HV stability of kapton, the cleanliness of ROB and ESTs, the signal and HV contact quality, the material parameters of the insulator, and the dimensions of the boards.

The following tests are proposed to ensure the above.

### The read out boards

* Prior to gluing
* Inspect cleaning of boards after etching This ensures that any chemical attack of the kapton is stopped. Unless this is done, the HV stand-off properties of the material can deteriorate with time. Manual check.
* **R:** Electrical test of the read out pad integrity This ensures electrical isolation of the individual electrodes. It can be done by using a fork contact, and a go-no-go R-meter.
* **R:** Visual inspection of the inter electrode gap This will ensure low cross talk. A visual inspection is required.
* **R:** Inspect for dust and flakes on glue, kapton, and electrodes This ensures that as little as possible corona points are embedded in the ROB. It can be done by visual and manual inspection.
* **T:** Check the dimensions of the individual boards (including the holes) in a go-no-go gauge This is a sanity check. It can be done, by fitting the boards into a box with the appropriate dimensions, including the shape and position of the the holes for the tie rods, and the connection tabs. Checking alignment in the gluing jig will do most of this.
* After gluing and soldering of pins
* Check the dimensions of the ROBs (including holes) in a go-no-go gauge This is to confirm the quality of the cutting process, and of the alignment during gluing.
* Inspect signal and HV pins for contact quality, removal of flux, and solder balls This is to ensure the contact quality. A visual inspection by a trained eye should suffice.
* Visual inspection of the edges for tears, and the 2.50 mm HV standoff

* Measure the resistance between the two HV pins of each HRL This provides damage control, and a check for inhomogeneities in the surface. A DC resistance measurement with a simple hand-held R-meter will suffice.
* HV test of the insulating layers: Electrodes grounded, HV on HRLs Test the HV properties of the insulating layer. Ground all electrodes simultaneously, and apply HV at both HRLs. Keep at the HV at 2.5 kV for one hour. One can test a stack of ROBs at a time, to speed up this operation.
* As above at 2.5 kV, but for an extended period, initially two to three weeks. As above.
* Test of the HV standoff between the HRLs of each ROB Apply high voltage to one HRL, and have the other HRL at ground. Test the HV stand-off at the edges of the boards at 2.5 kV.

**U:** HV test the HRL surface for corona points (remove them) This to minimize HV problems. This test can be done using a box, filled with honeycomb material of appropriate thickness, with an extended HV contact at the bottom. The HV applied will be 2.5 kV. * **R:** Inspect boards for cleanliness Ensure that possible residue from the corona point removal is cleaned off. This is a visual inspection. * **R:**_Sample_ the thickness of the ROBs Ensure precise knowledge of the argon gap. This can be done using a micrometer screw. * **T:**_Sample_ the capacitance between the two HRLs of one board Save for later use in wave-shape analysis and calculations. This could also point to isolated areas on the HRL.

### The EST boards

* **R:** Check dimensions of EST board (including holes) in a go-no-go gauge This is a sanity check. It can be done, by fitting into a box with the appropriate dimensions, including the shape and position of the the holes
* **R:** Inspection of the HV pins for contact quality, removal of flux, and solder balls This ensures the contact quality. A visual inspection by a trained eye should suffice.
* **U:** Visual inspection of the edges for tears, and 2.50 mm stand off Ensure HV standoff.
* **R:** Measure the resistance between the two HV pins This provides damage control, and checks for inhomogeneities in the HRL. A DC resistance measurement with a simple hand-held R-meter will suffice.
* **U:** HV test of insulator and HV standoff Apply HV at one HRL, and ground at the other. Apply HV at 2.5 kV for one hour. This operation could again be done in quantity.
* **U:** As above, but for an extended period, initially two to three weeks. Test at 2.5 kV.
* **U:** HV test HRLs for corona points (remove them) This is to minimize HV problems. This test can be done using a box, filled with honeycomb material, with an extended HV contact at the bottom. The HV applied should be 2.5 kV.

* **R:** Inspect boards for cleanliness Ensure that possible residue from the corona point removal is cleaned off. This is a visual inspection.
* **R:**_Sampling_ of the capacitance between HRLs For later use in wave-shape analysis and calculations. This must be a dc C measurement.
* **R:**_Sample_ the thickness of the EST boards Ensure precise knowledge of the argon gap. This is a sporadic occupation and can be done using two flat aluminum plates of known thickness, and a micrometer screw.

## 6 Stacking site

The issues to be checked at this site are personnel safety, shipping damage, mechanical tolerances, cleanliness, material properties, signal and HV connections, HV safety, proper cabling, and calibration resistors.

The tests proposed to take care of these issues are the following:

* Prior to Module assembly
* Copper plates
* Inspection of plate dimensions (including tolerances) with standard tooling Check for transport damage like bending, reconfirm manufacturing to tolerance. This can be done as at the copper plate production site.
* Inspection of edges and screw holes for slivers This is to ensure personnel safety. A manual and visual inspection should be done.
* Manual check of copper surface Check for transport damage, and metal chips introduced during packing and transport. This is a manual check.
* Inspection of cleanliness This is to avoid a possible pollution of liquid argon. This can be done manually.
* Inspection of handedness of plates Ensure the pre-amplifier and HV boards will be mountable. A visual inspection will do this.
* Tie rods and spacers
* **T:**_Sample_ the dimensions of the spacers (each batch) For later knowledge of the sampling frequency.

* Inspect tie rods for 90 degree angle of end piece You will get this for free when putting the first copper plate down.
* Inspect the tie rods for material flaws This is to ensure the module stability. A visual inspection is appropriate.
* EST and RO boards
* Reconfirm the resistance between the two HV terminals Check for damage. A DC R-meter can be used.
* Visual inspection of HV stand off Check for transport damage and damage of holes during gluing. A visual inspection of edges and holes for tears can be used.
* During module assembly
* Clean room
* Ensure the clean room rating To ensure clean room rating, standard procedure of the clean room. This may differ from site to site.
* After stacking a layer
* Monitor relative alignment of components in stack Minimize difficulties during wheel assembly. A visual inspection should suffice.
* HV test at 2.5 kV with all electrodes grounded, HV or ground at the respective HRLs Ensure HV properties of the layer, and remove residual corona points. Ensure that the edges of the EST layers have not been damaged during assembly. The leakage current should drop below 100 nA.
* HV test of the standoff between the two HRLs of the ROB at 2.5 kV This is to ensure that the edges of the ROB have not been damaged during assembly.
* Reconfirm the resistance between the two HV terminals This provides easy damage control.
* After module assembly
* Inspect the tie rod bolt torque This is to ensure personnel safety. A manual check should be sufficient.
* Inspect dimensions of stack, including the total height at both ends, and a possible tilt angle (go-no-go gauge) Ensure that the module has been built to specification, and is suitable for wheel assembly. A custom built box can be used.

**R,** unless a long term test of the kaptons was done earlier: HV test the entire module under controlled atmosphere for an extended period, initially two to three weeks at 2 kV This ensures the long term HV stability of the entire structure.
* Prior to shipping (after the module is wired: Signal, HV and calibration)
* Measure the tower series resistances and capacitances including cables at high frequency (perhaps 2 MHz) so as to obtain sensitivity to signal tab connection failure This is at this point in time the the only proposed way to check the connection of the signal tabs, apart from visual inspection, of the individual contacts.
* Brief (10 minutes) HV check of the entire module at 2 kV Reconfirm the HV stability of the structure.
* Measure the resistance between the two HV cables to each HRL. This is to check the HV connections, and reconfirm HRL properties. Check for possible aging effects. A DC R-meter can be used, as before.
* resistance measurement from the calibration cable to the respective signal cables, and to ground Check the signal cable connection, the calibration cable connection, the calibration resistor, and the calibration cable termination. Again a DC R measurement will suffice.

## 7 Wheel assembly and installation site

The issues at this site are personnel safety, check for shipping damage, pre-amplifier tests, clearances, and continuous damage monitoring.

The following tests are proposed, in order to cover the above topics:

* After arrival of a stack
* Check the dimensions of the module in a go-no-go gauge This is to check for shipping damage, and deformations. A box arrangement can be used.
* HV test the entire module This also checks for shipping damage. Connect the entire HV harness, and apply 2 kV for 10 minutes.
* Measure the cell capacitances (including cables) at high frequency Repeat the test done at the Stacking site, and reconform the numbers.
* Measure the height of the module at both ends This is to obtain information on sampling frequency, and its variations. Measurement to better than 0.25% of the stack height.
