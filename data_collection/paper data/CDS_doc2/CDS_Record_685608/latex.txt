As a modification to the baseline HV distribution system for the MDTs we propose a system that isolates each tube with a fuse. If the HV wire becomes shorted this fuse can be blown by means of a negative pulse of several hundred volts and lasting a few ms. This note provides the details of the design, tests performed with the design and results from these tests. We also give some costs figures for the components used in the test.

The baseline procedure to deal with shorts in the HV in an MDT tube is to turn off the HV to the whole tube layer where the offending tube resides. This results in the removal of on the order of 50 tubes from the system when a single tube becomes shorted. Presumably during some down time the shorted tube can be removed from the system. Since this procedure involves removing the Faraday cover and performing surgery on the HV cards, repair work might be performed infrequently and at some risk for creating additional damage to the MDT multilayer and neighboring detectors. The ALEPH detector has utilized fuses in the calorimeter proportional chambers which allows them to disconnect the offending shorted wire by means of an electrical pulse (of opposite sign to the normal HV) to the chambers. Only the fuse connected to the shorted wire is sensitive to that pulse and hence the pulse selectively blows the fuse of the shorted wire. We present a circuit design and selection of components for such a fuse system appropriate to the ATLAS MDT tubes and discuss the critical issues involved with these components. We have tested this design and component selection to check that the calculations are correct and this note provides the nature and the results of these tests.

The use of fuses would provide better performance as well as allow a reduction in the number of power supply channels. For specificity we propose that one HV channel be provided for each multilayer instead of the current baseline of one channel per layer.

A PC board with 24 channels of fuse circuits that are the functional equivalent of circuits for MDT tubes was fabricated and tested. The circuit schematic is shown in Fig. 1. A layout of a single channel and parts list is shown in Fig. 2A and the board layout is shown in Fig. 2B. Following board assembly and cleaning, some sparking was observed across the surface mounted HV capacitors but that went away with time and they operated spark free up to 4500 V, the HV limit of the tests. No fuses failed during this burn out period.

We have done the tests using the Wickman fuse 19194-028, a 125 mA rated 5 mm x 20 mm ceramic case fuse. Calculations show that 160 mA would work equally well. It appears from the specifications that glass might also be a suitable option instead of ceramic at considerable cost saving. The difference here being that the ceramic fuse can take a 1500 A pulse without exploding where as the glass equivalent can only handle a 35 amp pulse where the durations of such pulses are limited to the time it takes to blow the fuse. We do not need the 1500 A protection from breaking, however voltage creep on glass is known to be a concern. Future tests with glass fuses may show it not to be a problem in our circuit.

The fuses we used are rated at only 250 VDC but they did not break down up to the 7 KV limit of the tests. Even small discharges were looked for by measuring the voltage fluctuations across a \(1\) Meg Ohm resistor in series with the fuse using a digital scope. No fluctuations above the 10 mV background noise were observed. Wickman makes a 5000 V fuse but it is much longer (65 mm). The extra length is in part do to an allowance for the fuse being wet or dirty. Also if the fuse is used in a situation where an occasional spark would not do any damage as in the MDT case then the fuse can be operated at a much higher voltage than its specification limit.

The next step is to find out how much energy is required to be sure to blow the fuse. For short pulses ( a few ms) this is given by the energy delivered to the fuse and is related to the integral of I\({}^{2}\)dt. R is of course not constant during the heating process and subsequent evaporation of the fuse wire, however, the fuse literature does not appear to deal with this issue and only uses the integral of I\({}^{2}\)dt, called the melting integral, for a variety of pulse shapes. In reality it is hard to keep I constant and the actual energy deposited should be determined by the time dependent resistance. The melting integral itself does not of course assume that R is constant, but for a constant I the integral does define the energy needed to blow the fuse. A pulse of < 5 ms is consider short enough to use the melting integral to determine the point at which the fuse is guaranteed to blow or is guaranteed that it will not blow. This A\({}^{2}\) s limit is given by the IEC 127-2/1 specification shown if Fig. 3 for the 125 mA fuse and Fig. 4 for the 160 mA fuse. The triangles show the standard limits and the solid line gives the average value for failure for the particular Wickman fuse. In Fig. 4 is also shown a tolerance bar within the range of which all the fuses are known to operate. This shows a much narrower window of operation than given by the standard; however, to be conservative we use the values given by the standard for performance considerations. For the 125 mA fuse the certainty to blow value is 0.03 A\({}^{2}\) s. The fuse resistance rises from 4 Ohms at low current to 40 Ohms at the rated current limit of 125 mA. Hence for a 400 V pulse, an upper limit on the order of 0.5 ms is required to blow the fuse. A typical time to blow the fuse is actually about 70 \(\mu\)s. This was verified on a few fuses.

There are four additional tests that the fuses must pass. In the first of these we determine that the non-shorted fuses do not also fail when we pulse the circuit to blow a shorted fuse. In regards to the non-shorted fuses, these fuses are guaranteed not to blow at a value of 7.5 10\({}^{4}\) A\({}^{2}\) s. The dominant heating comes from the current supplied by the 1 nF coupling capacitor to the ASD. Assuming a 50 Ohm termination, then the melting integral is given by 1/2 (400/50) \({}^{2}\) 50 10\({}^{9}\) = 1.6 10\({}^{4}\) A\({}^{2}\) s. This is a factor of 500 below the threshold to blow the fuse. The board was pulsed at 400 V and only the shorted fuse failed. When no fuses were shorted, then no fuses failed.

The second test is to determine if any damage is done to the fuse when a spark occurs in the tube. We don't know how to model a spark so we just create sparks by shorting the tube end of the fuse to ground. The only current through the fuse comes from the recharge of the capacitors in the circuit. This is limited to 4 mA by the resistor chain (and diode direction). The heating for this situation is negligible since 4 mA is well below the rated value for the fuse. The fuses on the board were shorted to ground and no fuses failed. Hence sparks are not a problem for the fuses. However it should be noted that a continuous current of 4 mA would melt the solder connecting the resistors and hence the HV power supply circuit should be made to trip under such conditions.

The third test involves determining the effects of the non-shorted tubes on the pulse to break the fuse in the shorted tube. For 150 tubes run in parallel, there will typically be a 300 nF load to charge up. The charge to reach 400 V is 0.1 mC. This is to be compared to the charge delivered to blow the fuse of 10A x 0.5 ms = 5 mC. This is 50 times the charge to the other tubes so they have a negligible effect. Again we verified with tests that these extra tubes did not prevent the pulse from blowing the shorted tube.

A forth test that the fuses must pass if we allow for a negative HV to cure the tubes when damaged by radiation, is to show that a spark in one of the tubes does not cause a problem. This situation is different from the case of a spark in the normal set up where the current is limited by the decoupling resistor. In that case the current from N (usually about 150) other tubes will feed the shorted tube. Again we don't have a model for a spark and must allow for a short in the wire. We calculate the melting integral. The initial current is N V/R, where N is the number of tubes, V the HV and R the decoupling resistance. For N=150, V=4000 and R=10\({}^{6}\) Ohms, I= 4 10\({}^{3}\) A/tube. The RC time constant, \(\tau\), equals 2 10\({}^{-3}\)s. Hence, for 150 tubes in parallel, the melting integral is 1/2 I\({}^{2}\)\(\tau\) = 3.6 10\({}^{4}\) A\({}^{2}\) s. This is to be compared to the minimum threshold to blow the fuse of 7.5 10\({}^{4}\) A\({}^{2}\)s. The typical value to blow the fuse is 3.6 10\({}^{3}\) A\({}^{2}\) s, a factor of 10 more than the melting integral. For a 160 mA fuse, the threshold is 1.2 10\({}^{-3}\) A\({}^{2}\) s, a safety factor of 3 over the melting integral. We should note from Fig. 4 that the actual threshold to blow the fuse is much closer to the average value than the specification limits.

We tested the circuit against this last type of failure mode by adding to our test board a 250 nF capacitance coupled through 8 K Ohms to give it a 2 ms decay time. This provided a total of about a 300 nF load, the value expected for running 150 tubes in parallel. We sparked the 24 channels of 125 mA rated fuses (Wickman 19194-028) on our board at HVlevels of 3 KV, 4 KV and 4.3 KV. No fuses were blown as expected. The power supply high voltage values were checked with a HV probe and DVM.

From these considerations we have shown that the above system can work for the MDTs with a comfortable safety factor. We speculate that for a short that does not appear until a substantial HV is applied could also be treated this way by applying the pulse on top of the HV bias, the bias being set just below the level of the appearance of the short. There still remains the task of devising a circuit layout for the actual HV boards and to find the lowest cost for components. Using the best values from the Digi-Key catalog for the diodes, a telephone quote from Wickman of 33 cents each for the fuses and a written quote fro little fuse of 4.4 cents for the fuse clips, the component cost is 87 cents. This number is based on small part counts for the diodes and we expect further saving on the large quantities required. Furthermore, the Wickman engineer we consulted said that they did not consider themselves competitive in price for this type of fuse and he thought we could do better by looking around at other companies. Little Fuse was substantially worse in price however. If through-hole type diodes could be used there would be at least an additional saving of 37 cents in the parts cost, bringing the cost down to about 50 cents per tube.
