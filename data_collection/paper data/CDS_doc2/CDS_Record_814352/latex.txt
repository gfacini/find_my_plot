Stringent tests of the \(t\overline{t}\) production mechanisms and of the top decay are provided by \(t\overline{t}\) spin correlation. This note presents a detailed study of \(t\overline{t}\) spin correlation measurement with the ATLAS detector in the semileptonic channel (\(t\overline{t}\to WbW\overline{b}\to l\nu bj_{1}j_{2}\overline{b}\)). It is based on leading order Monte-Carlo generators and a fast simulation of the detector. A precision better than 15% on Standard Model spin correlation observable, driven by systematic uncertainties, can be achieved in one LHC year at \(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) or \(2\cdot 10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), including pile-up events. This sets the limit of sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model.

It is known since long that, because of its very high mass, the top quark decays before it can form hadronic bound states [1]. This unique feature among quarks allows the study of its spin properties, since they are not washed out by hadronization and the typical spin-flip time is much larger than the top lifetime. Spin-polarization [2] and spin-correlation [3] are subtle effects that reflect fundamental interactions involved in the top quark production and decay [4, 5]. Thus, they offer an opportunity for precise tests of these interactions and possible deviations from the Standard Model. For example, an observation of the expected Standard Model spin properties would confirm that the top quark is the Standard Model partner of the \(b\)-quark, with a left-handed coupling, a 1/2 spin, and would set an upper limit on its lifetime, directly linked to CKM matrix elements [6]. Spin properties can also probe the presence of non-standard interactions in the top quark production and/or decay. A non-exhaustive list involves heavy spin 0 resonance, such as a heavy (pseudo)scalar Higgs boson [7], technicolor [8], extra dimensions [9], deviation from V-A structure [10], decay to charged Higgs boson [11], and anomalous \(CP\)-violating \(gt\bar{t}\) couplings [12].

In ATLAS, simulation results indicate that \(t\bar{t}\) spin correlation can be observed in the dileptonic channel (\(t\bar{t}\to WbW\bar{b}\to l\nu bl\nu\bar{b}\)) in one year at low luminosity [13]. The goal of this paper is to compute the precision to which \(t\bar{t}\) spin correlation can be measured in the more challenging semileptonic channel (\(t\bar{t}\to WbW\bar{b}\to l\nu bj_{1}j_{2}\bar{b}\)). This precision will set the limit of sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the top spin properties and related physics observables. Section 3 presents event and detector simulations, whereas section 4 describes event selection and reconstruction. Section 5 details the observable measurement and the complete study of their systematic uncertainties. Section 6 is dedicated to conclusions.

## 2 Top spin properties

This section presents the top spin observables in the two distinct production processes at LHC: single top via the electroweak interaction and \(t\bar{t}\) pairs via the strong interaction.

### Single top

The best way to access top spin information is to measure the angular distribution of its decay products (\(t\to Wb\to l\nu(j_{1}j_{2})b\)), which will be thereby called spin analyzers. This angular distribution is [10]:

\[\frac{1}{N}\frac{dN}{d\cos\theta_{i}}=\frac{1}{2}(1+S\alpha_{i}\cos\theta_{i}) \tag{1}\]

where \(S\) is the modulus of the top polarization and \(\theta_{i}\) is the angle between the direction of flight of the \(i^{th}\) decay product in the top quark rest frame and the direction of the top polarization. \(\alpha_{i}\) is the spin analyzing power of this particle. It is the degree to which its direction is correlated to the spin of the parent top quark. It has been computed at the next-to-leading order (NLO) since long for the lepton (\(l\)) [14] and more recently for the \(b\) quark, the \(W\) boson and the quarks from the \(W\) decay [15]. The theoretical values are given both at LO and NLO in Table 1 for a spin up top quark (signs are reversed for a spin down or for an anti-quark). Even if \(W\) and \(b\) are direct daughters of the top, their analyzing power is low due to the intrinsic polarization of the \(W\), which interferes destructively with the top one. Charged leptons and down-type quarks, which are almost 100% correlated with the top spin direction, are optimal spin analyzers. However, contrary to leptons, \(d\) and \(s\)-jets can not be distinguished experimentally from \(u\) and \(c\)-jets. Analyzing power of jets is therefore the average value \(\alpha_{\rm jet}\sim(1-0.31)/2=0.35\). A more interesting choice is the least energetic jet (\(lej\)) in the top rest frame, which is of \(d\) type in 61% of the case, resulting to \(\alpha_{i}\sim 0.5\).

At LHC, single top quarks are fully polarized (\(S\sim 100\%\)) [16] and the corresponding cross-section is around 300 pb. A measurement of top and \(W\) polarizations is possible with a precision of a few percent after three years at low luminosity (30 fb\({}^{-1}\)) [17].

### \(t\bar{t}\) pairs

Similarly, top spin properties can be studied with top quark pairs. At LHC, they are produced by gluon fusion or quark annihilation mechanisms (\(gg\), \(q\bar{q}\to t\bar{t}\)), in a proportion of about 90% and 10%, respectively. The cross-section, \(\sim\) 850 pb, is almost three times larger than for single top production. Even if the polarization of top and antitop quarks are zero at LO and very small at NLO [18], a large asymmetry (\(A\)) is expected for producing like-spin versus unlike-spin top quark pairs, which can be expressed as [11]:

\[A=\frac{\sigma(t_{\uparrow}\bar{t}_{\uparrow})+\sigma(t_{\downarrow}\bar{t}_{ \downarrow})-\sigma(t_{\downarrow}\bar{t}_{\downarrow})-\sigma(t_{\downarrow} \bar{t}_{\uparrow})}{\sigma(t_{\uparrow}\bar{t}_{\uparrow})+\sigma(t_{ \downarrow}\bar{t}_{\downarrow})+\sigma(t_{\uparrow}\bar{t}_{\downarrow})+ \sigma(t_{\downarrow}\bar{t}_{\uparrow})} \tag{2}\]

where \(\sigma(t_{\uparrow/\downarrow}\bar{t}_{\uparrow/\downarrow})\) denotes the production cross section of a top quark pair with spins up or down with respect to a specific quantization axis. Computation in the Standard Model gives favorably like-spin pairs at LHC (\(A>0\)) when using the helicity basis1 for the spin

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l||c|c||c|c|c|c|} \hline Particle & \(b\)-jet & \(W^{+}\) & \(l^{+}\) & \(j_{1}\)=\(\bar{d}\)-jet, \(\bar{s}\)-jet & \(j_{2}\)=\(u\)-jet, \(c\)-jet & \(lej\) \\ \hline \(\alpha_{i}\) (LO) & -0.41 & 0.41 & 1 & 1 & -0.31 & 0.51 \\ \hline \(\alpha_{i}\) (NLO) & -0.39 & 0.39 & 0.998 & 0.93 & -0.31 & 0.47 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: _Spin analyzing power at LO and NLO of top quark daughters: \(b\)-jet, \(W^{+}\), and \(W\) decay products : lepton (\(l^{+}\)), \(j_{1}\), \(j_{2}\) or the least energetic non \(b\)-jet in the top rest frame, called lej [15]. The top quark is spin up. Signs are reversed for a spin down or for an anti-quark._basis. In this basis, the top (anti-top) spin quantization axis corresponds to the top (anti-top) direction of flight in the \(t\overline{t}\) center of mass system, and the notation \(\uparrow\), \(\downarrow\) is replaced by L (Left) and R (Right). The theoretical Standard Model value at LO is \(A=0.319\) and at NLO is [20]:

\[A=0.326^{+0.003}_{-0.002}(\mu)^{+0.013}_{+0.001}(PDF) \tag{3}\]

with systematic uncertainties coming from factorization and renormalization scales (\(\mu=\mu_{F}=\mu_{R}\)) and from Parton Distribution Function (PDF). As \(A\) is defined as a ratio between two cross sections, PDF, \(\mu\) and \(\alpha_{S}\) dependences cancel to a large extent. Moreover, NLO QCD corrections are small and thus theoretical uncertainties are well under control. Figure 1 shows the invariant mass distribution of the \(t\overline{t}\) system with like and unlike helicities for the two possible production mechanisms [21]. \(gg\) and \(q\bar{q}\) contribute to the asymmetry \(A\) with opposite signs (\(A>0\) for \(gg\) and \(A<0\) for \(q\bar{q}\)). \(A\) is maximum for low invariant masses, and like and unlike helicity contributions from \(gg\) become equal around \(M_{t\overline{t}}=900\) GeV. Therefore, an upper cut on \(M_{t\overline{t}}\) is applied in the following, selecting low energetic top quarks. Using \(M_{t\overline{t}}<550\) GeV, \(A\) is enhanced by about 40%, rejecting only 30% of the events.

### \(t\overline{t}\) spin correlation observables

Similarly to Equation (1) for the single top, angular distributions can be used to probe \(t\overline{t}\) spin correlation, as:

* the double differential angular distribution of top and anti-top quark decay products [22]: \[\frac{1}{N}\frac{d^{2}N}{d\cos\theta_{1}d\cos\theta_{2}}=\frac{1}{4}(1+B_{1} \cos\theta_{1}+B_{2}\cos\theta_{2}-C\cos\theta_{1}\cos\theta_{2})\] (4) where \(\theta_{1}\) (\(\theta_{2}\)) is the angle between the direction of the \(t\) (\(\overline{t}\)) spin analyzer in the \(t\) (\(\overline{t}\)) rest frame and the \(t\) (\(\overline{t}\)) direction in the \(t\overline{t}\) center of mass system. These complicated angles are the direct consequence of the choice of the 'helicity' basis for measuring the asymmetry \(A\). As top and anti-top quarks are not polarized in this basis, \(B_{1}=B_{2}=0\). Figure 2 (top panel) shows this double angular distribution at parton level.
* the opening angle distribution [20]: \[\frac{1}{N}\frac{dN}{d\cos\Phi}=\frac{1}{2}(1-D\cos\Phi)\] (5) where \(\Phi\) is the angle between the direction of flight of the two spin analyzers, defined in the \(t\) and \(\overline{t}\) rest frames respectively. Figure 2 (down panel) shows this opening angle distribution at parton level.

In Equations (4) and (5), \(C\) and \(D\) are spin correlation observables. They give a direct access to the production (\(A\)) and decay (\(\alpha_{1}\) and \(\alpha_{2}\)) processes. As an example, \(C\sim A|\alpha_{1}\alpha_{2}|\). Both processes will have to be tested independently if \(C\) and \(D\) are not compatible with Standard Model predictions. This test can be provided by the measurement of \(W\) polarization with single top [17] or \(t\overline{t}\) events [23].

LO and NLO Standard Model expectations for \(C\) and \(D\) are given in Table 2 for the different \(t\overline{t}\) decay channels. Since leptons are the most powerful spin analyzers, the dileptonic case, where both \(W\) decay in leptons, is a priori the most promising. The all hadronic case is the most unfavorable, with a low spin analyzing power and a huge background. The semileptonic channel is more challenging compared to the dileptonic one because its spin analyzers on the hadronic side (\(W\), \(b\) or \(leg\)) are less powerful than the lepton. But contrary to the dileptonic channel \(i\)) the number of events is 6 times larger and \(ii\)) the event reconstruction is much easier (only one neutrino). This paper will prove that spin correlations can also be measured in this channel and be competitive with the dileptonic one.

Experimentally, \(t\overline{t}\) spin correlation has never been observed. The D0 experiment sets a lower limit on \(C\) with 6 dilepton events from run I (125 pb\({}^{-1}\)) [24]. This limit, \(C>-0.25\) at 68% confidence level, can not be compared to the LHC values because the dominant production process at Tevatron is \(q\overline{q}\to t\overline{t}\), and the Standard Model prediction is \(C=0.88\). A sensitivity around 2.5 \(\sigma_{\rm stat}\) is expected in run II, neglecting the systematics.

## 3 Event and detector simulation

Software tools used to generate and simulate events using a modeling of the ATLAS detector are discussed.

### Signal and background definition

General figures of \(t\overline{t}\) pairs decay are summarized in Figure 3, left panel: \(Br(t\to Wb)\sim 1\), \(Br(W\to l\nu_{l})\sim 1/3\) with \(l=e,\mu,\tau\) in equal probabilities and \(Br(W\to q_{1}q_{2})\sim 2/3\) with \(q_{1}(q_{2})=u(d),c(s)\) in equal probabilities. With a cross-section of 850 pb, 3.8 millions of \(t\overline{t}\) semileptonic events are produced per LHC year at low luminosity (\(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), \(10\) fb\({}^{-1}\)). Among them, 2.5 millions are signal events, defined as:

\[t\overline{t}\to WbW\overline{b}\to l\nu bj_{1}j_{2}\overline{b} \tag{6}\]

with \(l=e,\mu\) and illustrated in Figure 3 (right panel). The 1.3 million \(l=\tau\) events are considered as background. The control of the background is of utmost importance since spin correlation is a subtle effect. Background events are divided in two categories:

* \(t\overline{t}\) background, which includes semileptonic decay with \(l=\tau\) in (6) and \(t\overline{t}\) non-semileptonic decay (dileptonic and all hadronic cases).
* Non-\(t\overline{t}\) background, which is mainly composed of \(W\)+4 jets, \(b\overline{b}\), \(Z(\to ll)\)+jets, \(Wb\overline{b}\) and 2 vector bosons (\(ZZ\),\(ZW\),\(WW\)).

### Monte Carlo Generators

Few Monte Carlo generators include the Standard Model \(t\overline{t}\) spin correlation at the leading order, among which TopReX 4.05 [25], AlpGen 1.33 [26], AcerMC 2.2 [27], and none at the NLO2. For the three LO generators, a top mass of 175 GeV is assumed and the structure function CTEQ5L [29] is used. The \(Q\)-scale used for \(\alpha_{S}\) is the same as for the structure

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & Dileptonic & Semileptonic & All hadronic \\ \hline \(C\) (LO) & 0.319 & 0.163 (0.217) & 0.083 \\ \(C\) (NLO) & 0.326 & 0.158 & 0.076 \\ \hline \(D\) (LO) & -0.217 & -0.111 (-0.148) & -0.057 \\ \(D\) (NLO) & -0.237 & -0.115 & -0.056 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In the semileptonic and full hadronic cases, the \(lej\) is used as spin analyzer. Numbers between brackets give our estimates when applying \(M_{t\overline{t}}<550\) GeV._function. Unfortunately, it is not possible to set the same \(Q^{2}\) value for every generators and we used \(p_{T}(t)^{2}+m_{t}^{2}\), \(m_{t}^{2}\) and \(\hat{s}\) for TopReX, AlpGen and AcerMC respectively. Consequently, different \(t\overline{t}\) cross sections at LO are obtained, respectively 370, 530 and 380 pb. The proportion of \(gg\) and \(q\overline{q}\) processes, which directly impacts the spin correlation (see Figure 1), are very similar (86/14, 86/14 and 85/15, respectively). A comparison of spin correlation observables at parton level is shown in Table 3 for the three generators. A very good agreement is obtained, proving that, as mentioned earlier, scale and \(\alpha_{S}\) dependences cancel to a large extent.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l||c|c|c|} \hline Generator & TopReX & AlpGen & AcerMC \\ \hline \hline \(C_{l\to lej}\) & 0.217 & 0.220 & 0.218 \\ \(C_{l\to W}\) & 0.169 & 0.177 & 0.177 \\ \(D_{l\to lej}\) & -0.148 & -0.152 & -0.150 \\ \(D_{l\to W}\) & -0.115 & -0.121 & -0.121 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The statistical errors are 0.002 for \(C\) and 0.001 for \(D\)._

Figure 3: _Left, breakdown of \(t\overline{t}\) events into various final states and their corresponding branching ratios. Right, schematic view of semileptonic \(t\overline{t}\) decay channel._

Partons are fragmented and hadronized using PYTHIA 6.2 [30] or HERWIG 6.5 [31]. For PYTHIA, the standard ATLAS setting is assumed: ISR and FSR switched on, \(b\)-fragmentation performed using Peterson parametrization with \(\epsilon_{b}=-0.006\), and multiple interaction in agreement with CDF data (MSTP(82)=4 and PARP(82)=2.2). TAUOLA and PHOTOS [32] are used for the \(\tau\) decay and radiative corrections.

For what concerns the non-\(t\overline{t}\) background generation, PYTHIA 6.2 is used except for \(W\)+4 jets and \(Wb\overline{b}\) which are treated with AlpGen and AcerMC, respectively. About \(3\cdot 10^{10}\)\(W(\to l\nu)\)+4 jets weighted events are generated with cuts on the four extra light jets: p\({}_{T}>\)10 GeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(\Delta R(\mbox{jet-jet})>\)0.43. Despite this huge effort, it only represents 380 000 events, 1/63\({}^{\rm rd}\) of the statistics for one LHC year. For \(b\overline{b}\), given the very high cross-section (\(\sim\)500 \(\mu\)b), the cut \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}>\)120 GeV is applied. It has been checked that this does not bias the background estimate. 750 million of events have been generated, corresponding to 1/8\({}^{\rm th}\) of the statistics for one year. Except for \(W\)+4 jets and \(b\overline{b}\), the statistics corresponding to one LHC year at low luminosity (10\({}^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) is simulated for each background without any cut at the parton level.

Footnote 3: \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}}\)

Unless otherwise stated, \(t\overline{t}\) events are simulated with TopReX+PYTHIA. A luminosity of 10\({}^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) is assumed and no pile-up events are superimposed. The influence of pile-up events will be discussed in section 5.2.3.

### Detector modeling

A simplified modeling of the ATLAS detector, ATLFAST 2.6.0 [33], is used. This essentially accounts for resolution smearing of objects accepted within the detector geometry, according to the expected performance [34]. Only settings of particular importance are recalled here:

* Isolation criteria only for lepton (electron and muon) consists in: _i_) asking \(E_{T}<10\) GeV in a pointing cone of 0.2 around the lepton and _ii_) requiring the nearest calorimeter cluster at \(\Delta R>0.4\).
* Jets are reconstructed with a cone algorithm, with a size \(\Delta R=0.4\). They are calibrated to obtain a correct jet energy scale [34].
* A \(b\)-tagging efficiency of \(\epsilon=0.6\) is assumed, as well as a \(c\)-jet rejection of 10. For the other jets, the rejection is 100. This is a rather pessimistic assumption compared to the latest simulation results [35].

No trigger inefficiencies are applied, and no detailed acceptance (as crack between barrel and endcap cryostat) is included in this analysis. A 100% electron, muon and jet efficiency is assumed4. All these effects are being investigated with a full ATLAS simulation [36]. However this should not impact the results because _i_) these effects are unfolded to measure the spin correlation (section 5.1) and _ii_) the measurement errors are dominated by systematic uncertainties (section 5.3).

Event selection and reconstruction

Semileptonic signal events are characterized by one (and only one) isolated lepton, at least 4 jets of which 2 are \(b\)-jets, and missing energy. The heavy top mass makes the event topology at LHC remarkable. Figure 4 shows that \(t\) and \(\overline{t}\) are preferentially produced in the central region (\(|\eta|<2.5\)) and back to back in the transverse plane. Therefore, \(t\) and \(\overline{t}\) are naturally well separated, which will ease the event reconstruction.

Semileptonic \(t\overline{t}\) events are selected by requiring an isolated lepton from first and second trigger level (LVL1+lvl2). Depending on the luminosity, \(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) or \(2\cdot 10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), the relevant trigger settings are EM20I+e20i or EM25I+e25i for electrons and MU6+\(\mu 20\) or MU8+\(\mu 20\) for muons5[34, 37]. In case of initial detector staging, it could even be set to EM30I+e30i and MU20I+\(\mu 20\)i. In the main analysis, all results are given for the first case (luminosity of \(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and no staging). The other scenarii are discussed at the end of section 5.3. In any case, the offline kinematic cut on the lepton is directly given by the trigger. Moreover, at least four jets with \(\mathrm{p}_{T}>30\) GeV are required, among which at least two are \(b\)-tagged. Higher \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\) cut values would select events with higher \(\mathrm{M}_{t\overline{t}}\), and consequently decrease \(C\) and \(D\) (see Figure 1). This cut is also a good compromise between a low combinatorial background and a good event reconstruction. The 20 GeV cut on \(\mathrm{p}_{T}^{miss}\) is standard for events with one neutrino and rejects almost no signal events.

Figure 4: _Left: azimuthal angle \(\phi\) and \(\eta\) distributions of the generated top quarks. Right: \(\Delta\phi\) and \(\Delta\eta\) between generated \(t\) and \(\overline{t}\). Vertical lines on the \(\eta\) distribution delimit the detector precision region (\(|\eta|<2.5\))._

All these kinematic cuts are summarized in Table 4. Their overall efficiency on the signal events is 9%. Figure 5 shows the jet and lepton p\({}_{T}\) distributions after kinematic cuts. The average lepton and \(lej\) p\({}_{T}\) are around 50 GeV.

After kinematic cuts, the full event topology is reconstructed. On the top hadronic decay side, the two non \(b\)-jets with M\({}_{jj}\) closest to M\({}_{W}^{PDG}\) are selected. The event is kept if the mass difference is less than 20 GeV. Then, the \(b\)-jet with M\({}_{jjb}\) closest to M\({}_{t}^{PDG}\) is chosen to reconstruct the hadronic top. On the leptonic side, p\({}_{T}^{miss}\) is used to evaluate the neutrino p\({}_{T}\). Its p\({}_{z}\) is determined by constraining M\({}_{l\nu}\) to M\({}_{W}^{PDG}\):

\[\left[E^{l}+\sqrt{(p_{T}^{\nu 2}+p_{z}^{\nu 2})}\right]^{2}-(p_{x}^{l}+p_{x}^{ \nu})^{2}-(p_{y}^{l}+p_{y}^{\nu})^{2}-(p_{z}^{l}+p_{z}^{\nu})^{2}=(M_{W}^{PDG}) ^{2} \tag{7}\]

For 25% of the events, there is no solution since p\({}_{T}^{miss}\) overestimates p\({}_{T}^{\nu}\). In these cases, p\({}_{T}^{\nu}\) is decreased step by step to reach a solution. This method was first described in [38]. Then, the \(b\)-jet closest to the lepton in \(\Delta R\) is chosen to reconstruct the leptonic top.

Figure 6 shows the reconstructed \(W\) and top masses. Results are comparable with those of reference [39]. Quality cuts are then applied on the top and anti-top reconstructed masses (\(|\)M\({}_{t}-\)M\({}_{t}^{PDG}|<35\) GeV) to reject badly reconstructed events. At this stage, 4.5% of the signal events are kept. Moreover, a cut on the \(t\overline{t}\) reconstructed mass, whose distribution is shown in Figure 6 (down right panel), is applied: M\({}_{t\overline{t}}<550\) GeV. As already discussed in section 2.2, this cut increases the spin correlation effect and allows to get rid of uncertainties at high p\({}_{T}\), where Monte-Carlo generators generally differ and NLO effects are most sensitive [40]. Table 4 lists all the selection cuts. Their overall efficiency is 3%.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l||c|c|} \hline Selection type & Variables & Cuts \\ \hline \hline \multirow{3}{*}{Kinematic and acceptance} & \(=\)1 isolated lepton & p\({}_{T}\)\(>\) 20 GeV, \(|\eta|<\) 2.5 \\  & \(\geq\) 4 jets & p\({}_{T}\)\(>\) 30 GeV, \(|\eta|<\) 2.5 \\  & \(b\)-tagged jets & \(\geq\) 2 \\  & Missing energy (\(\nu\)) & p\({}_{T}^{miss}\)\(>\) 20 GeV \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{Reconstruction quality} & \(|\)M\({}_{W}^{had}\)-M\({}_{W}^{PDG}\) & \(<\) 20 GeV \\  & \(|\)M\({}_{t}^{had}\)-M\({}_{t}^{PDG}\) & \(<\) 35 GeV \\ \cline{1-1}  & \(|\)M\({}_{t}^{lep}\)-M\({}_{t}^{PDG}\) & \(<\) 35 GeV \\ \cline{1-1}  & M\({}_{t\overline{t}}\) & \(<\) 550 GeV \\ \hline \end{tabular}

After selection criteria are applied, 80% of the background is composed of \(t\bar{t}\to\tau+X\) events. The remaining non-\(t\bar{t}\) background is dominated by \(W(\to l\nu)+4\) jets and \(b\bar{b}\) events. Since only a few tens of events subsist after all cuts, Poisson statistics is used to give an estimate of the expected number of non-\(t\bar{t}\) background events. It will be neglected in the rest of the analysis. In total, about 6000 background events are expected for one LHC year at low luminosity, giving a Signal over Background ratio of 15.

The overall cut efficiencies are shown in Table 5 for signal and background using TopReX6. Results from other Monte-Carlo generators (AlpGen, AcerMC using HERWIG or PYTHIA) are in good agreement with these numbers. The only difference comes from the reconstructed top \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\), which is harder for AcerMC compared to TopReX and AlpGen, resulting in a 10% increase of the cut efficiency.

Footnote 6: No results are shown for pure dileptonic \(t\bar{t}\), since no events are present after all cuts are applied.

In this section, the method to extract unbiased estimators of spin correlation observables (\(C\) and \(D\)) is explained (section 5.1), the accuracy to which they can be measured is discussed (section 5.2), and the final results including statistical and systematic uncertainties are presented (section 5.3).

### Measurement method

Estimators of spin correlation observables can be derived from Equations (4) and (5) of section 2.3[20]:

\[C=-9<\cos\theta_{1}\cos\theta_{2}> \tag{8}\] \[D=-3<\cos\Phi> \tag{9}\]

At the parton level, before any phase-space cut, the two estimators are unbiased. The corresponding distributions of \(-9\cos\theta_{1}\cos\theta_{2}\) and \(-3\cos\Phi\) are shown in Figure 7 with M\({}_{t\overline{t}}<550\) GeV. Their respective mean values correspond to Table 3 TopReX results given in section 3.2.

At the selection and reconstruction level, the \(\theta_{1}\), \(\theta_{2}\) and \(\Phi\) angles are computed (see details in Appendix 1). Selection cuts distort the parton level angular distributions, as illustrated in Figure 8 with the double angular distribution of Equation (4). Thus, Equations (8) and (9) are no longer unbiased estimators of the spin correlation observables. This bias can be estimated using a dedicated test sample generated without spin correlation (PYTHIA), and assuming that cut and reconstruction effects are completely uncorrelated from spin correlation. The distortion of the double angular distribution for this sample is shown in Figure 9. Figure 10 presents the ratio of Figure 8 and 9, illustrating that spin correlation effects are preserved after reconstruction and cuts.

Figure 10: _Ratio of plots from Figure 8 and Figure 9._

Figure 9: _Same as Figure 8, using the PYTHIA generator, which do not include spin correlation._

To account for these selection and reconstruction effects, a correction is applied on an event by event basis to get back, as much as possible, the original asymmetry. One weight is applied per spin correlation observable, \(C_{l\to leg}\), \(C_{l\to W}\), \(D_{l\to leg}\) and \(D_{l\to W}\). These weights are computed, from the PYTHIA test sample, by fitting the selection efficiency in \(\cos\theta_{1}\cos\theta_{2}\) (\(\cos\Phi\)) bins for \(C\) (\(D\)). This is shown in Figure 11, with a mean weight set to 1. To extract a correction function for \(C\) (\(D\)) observables, fourth (first) order polynomial fits are performed on each distribution. It has been checked that adding parameters does not improve the fits, and less parameters degrade the results. The \(C\) corrections have a wider range with respect to the \(D\) ones. It means that \(C\) is more sensitive to selection and reconstruction effects.

As a crosscheck, these parametrized corrections, applied event by event on an independent PYTHIA sample, give \(C_{l\to leg}=0.00\pm 0.01\), \(C_{l\to W}=0.01\pm 0.01\), \(D_{l\to leg}=-0.01\pm 0.01\) and \(D_{l\to W}=0.00\pm 0.01\). Therefore, the uncertainty of the method is estimated to be smaller than the statistical error. It should be noticed that this method requires a very accurate detector simulation.

These correction functions, computed on a specific sample, will be applied event by event on all the other samples. As an example, results obtained with the TopReX sample are shown in Table 6 (left row). Compared to theoretical values (Table 3), a small dilution of the correlation is observed, which is mainly due to the reconstruction.

The polynomial functions resulting from the fits are superimposed (solid lines)._

### Systematic uncertainties

In order to reduce the influence of statistical errors, samples corresponding to three LHC years at low luminosity (30 fb\({}^{-1}\)) are generated for each source of systematic uncertainties.

#### 5.2.1 Systematic uncertainties from Monte-Carlo

In this subsection, five main sources of systematic uncertainties are considered:

* Parton generation: The uncertainties related to the parton generation with spin correlation are estimated by comparing AcerMC and AlpGen results with TopReX ones. In all cases, the same hadronization scheme (PYTHIA) is used. The input \(Q^{2}\) values are different (section 3.2) and related systematics are therefore included in this comparison. Results are shown in Table 6, and can be compared with parton level ones (Table 3). The corresponding systematic uncertainty is presented in Table 7.
* Structure function: The impact of structure function is estimated by the maximum difference between the measurements obtained with the standard PDF (CTEQ 5L) and two other ones, MRST98 and GRV987. Results are given in Table 7. One of the main contribution to these results is the proportion of \(gg\) and \(q\bar{q}\) processes involved in \(t\bar{t}\) pairs production, which directly impacts the spin correlation (see Figure 1). This proportion is 86/14, 88/12 and 88/12, for CTEQ5L, MRST98 and GRV98 respectively. To study separately this effect, samples with different proportions of \(gg/q\bar{q}\) have been generated from 82/18 to 90/10 by steps of 2%8. Figure 12 (a) shows \(C\) and \(D\) after reconstruction and cuts. Small and smooth dependences are observed. The related uncertainties on \(C\) and \(D\) are smaller than the statistical errors if the relative proportion of \(gg\) and \(q\bar{q}\) is known to better than 2%. Footnote 7: MRST 98 has Ngroup=3 and Nset=72 in PDFLIB and GRV98 Ngroup=5 and Nset=12.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l||c|c|c|} \hline Generator & TopReX & AlpGen & AcerMC \\ \hline \hline \(C_{l\to lej}\) & 0.181 & 0.167 & 0.175 \\ \(C_{l-W}\) & 0.168 & 0.175 & 0.183 \\ \(D_{l\to lej}\) & -0.142 & -0.138 & -0.141 \\ \(D_{l-W}\) & -0.127 & -0.136 & -0.132 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: \(C\) _and \(D\) after reconstruction and cuts for different Monte-Carlo generators. \(lej\) and \(W\) are the spin analyzers on the hadronic side, while charged lepton (\(l\)) is used on the leptonic side. The statistical errors are 0.006 for \(C\) and 0.004 for \(D\)._* ISR, FSR: The presence of initial state radiations (ISR) from incoming partons and final state radiations (FSR) can affect \(\theta_{1}\), \(\theta_{2}\) and \(\Phi\) angle reconstruction. To estimate the effect due to ISR, the difference between the measurements obtained with ISR switched on (usual data set) and off is computed. The same approach is used for FSR. The level of knowledge of ISR and FSR is around 10%. Therefore, as a more conservative estimate, the systematics uncertainties have been taken to be 20% of the corresponding differences. Results are given in Table 7.
* \(b\)-fragmentation: The \(b\)-quark fragmentation is performed according to the Peterson parametrization9, with one free parameter \(\epsilon_{b}\). The default value is set to \(\epsilon_{b}=-0.006\). It has been changed to a more recent LEP value (\(\epsilon_{b}=-0.0035\)[42]), and the differences on the observable values are taken as systematic uncertainties on \(C\) and \(D\). Results are given in Table 7. Footnote 9: It has to be noticed that recent measurements can not be well fitted with the Peterson parametrization [41].
* Hadronization scheme: The angular distributions of jets and leptons may be influenced by the hadronization scheme. Generating partons with AcerMC and hadronizing them with PYTHIA or HERWIG lead to different values of \(C\) and \(D\). The related systematic uncertainties are extracted from these differences and are given in Table 7.

#### 5.2.2 Systematic uncertainties from reconstruction

In this subsection, four main sources of systematic uncertainties are considered:

* \(b\)-tagging: The impact of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency has been studied by varying it from 50% to 70% by steps of 5%, according to a parametrization coming from full simulation [35]. Increasing (decreasing) the \(b\)-tagging efficiency degrades (improves) the \(c\)-jets and light jets rejection factors. As an example, going from 60% to 55% increases them respectively by 30% and 80%. Figure 12 (b) shows \(C\) and \(D\) after reconstruction and cuts. Small and smooth dependences are observed. The related error is computed by varying the \(b\)-tagging efficiency by \(\pm 5\%\) (Table 7).
* \(b\)-jet miscalibration: The impact of the knowledge of the absolute \(b\)-jet energy scale is estimated by miscalibrating the reconstructed jet energy. Results are shown in Figure 12 (c), for a miscalibration between \(\pm 5\%\). The effect on spin correlation is sizable, especially for \(C\). Taking a realistic \(\pm 3\%\) uncertainty on the \(b\)-jet energy scale results in an uncertainty of 0.023 for \(C_{l-lej}\) and 0.015 and \(C_{l-W}\). This assumption is discussed in section 5.2.4.
* Light-jet miscalibration: Similarly, the effect of light jet energy scale miscalibration is shown in Figure 12 (d). Assuming a \(\pm 1\%\) uncertainty on the light jet energy scale has a negligible impact on the results (Table 7).
* Input top mass: A 175 GeV top mass value is assumed in the event reconstruction (see section 4). This can impact \(C\) and \(D\) measurements if the real top mass is Figure 12: _Measured \(C\) (left) and \(D\) (right) as a function of different parameters (see text for more details). \(lej\) or \(W\) are the spin analyzers on the hadronic side, while charged lepton (\(l\)) is used on the leptonic side. Linear fits are superimposed in each case, and the corresponding slope is indicated._

different from 175 GeV. Therefore, different samples of events were generated with a top mass between 170 and 180 GeV by steps of 2.5 GeV. Results are shown in Figure 12 (e). The related uncertainty is computed assuming \(\Delta\)M\({}_{\rm top}\)=2 GeV, which should be reached at Tevatron run II [43]. This assumption is discussed in section 5.2.4.

#### 5.2.3 Other sources of systematic uncertainties

* Background: As shown in section 4, the only sizable background comes from \(t\bar{t}\to\tau+X\) events, and is well under control. A large variation of this background level by \(\pm 10\%\) has a negligeable impact on \(C\) and \(D\).
* Pile-up: Pile-up events may influence the reconstruction and therefore impact on \(C\) and \(D\) measurements. They are generated with PYTHIA setting MSTP(131)=1 and using the default process definition MSTP(132)=4. Because no vertexing is perform in ATLFAST, the primary vertex was not smeared along the \(z\) direction. Different samples were generated adding 2.3 or 4.6 pile-up events according to the Poisson law. These numbers are expected for a luminosity of \(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and 2\(\times 10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), respectively. Results are shown in Figure 13. The systematic uncertainty given in Table 7 correspond to the first case.

Figure 13: _Measured \(C\) (left) and \(D\) (right) as a function of the number of pile-up events. \(leg\) or \(W\) are the spin analyzers on the hadronic side, while charged lepton (\(l\)) is used on the leptonic side. Linear fits are superimposed in each case, and the corresponding slope is indicated._

#### 5.2.4 Systematics summary

All systematic uncertainties on \(C\) and \(D\) are listed in Table 7 and illustrated in Figure 14. Monte-Carlo and reconstruction sources contribute in the same proportion to the total error. The dominant Monte-Carlo contributions come from the parton generation and the FSR knowledge, while the reconstruction systematics are dominated by the \(b\)-jet mis-calibration and the top mass uncertainty. More generally, the total systematic error is almost two times lower for \(D\) than for \(C\).

The above results were obtained assuming realistic uncertainties of 3% on the \(b\)-jet energy scale and 2 GeV on the top mass. With more pessimistic assumptions (5% and 3 GeV), the total systematic errors on \(C_{l\to lej}\), \(C_{l-W}\), \(D_{l-lej}\) and \(D_{l-W}\) would increase to 0.053, 0.043, 0.021 and 0.029. In contrary, with more optimistic assumptions (1% and 1 GeV), the total systematic errors on \(C_{l\to lej}\), \(C_{l-W}\), \(D_{l\to lej}\) and \(D_{l-W}\) would decrease to 0.031, 0.028, 0.016 and 0.020. We can particularly notice that the error on \(D_{l\to lej}\) very weakly depends on these assumptions.

\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|} \hline Source of uncertainty & \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{Systematic error on} \\ \cline{2-5}  & \(C_{l-lej}\) & \(C_{l-W}\) & \(D_{l-lej}\) & \(D_{l-W}\) \\ \hline \hline

### Results

Table 8 presents the expected Standard Model results for \(C\) and \(D\) in the semileptonic channel after one LHC year at low luminosity (\(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), 10 fb\({}^{-1}\)). The sensitivity is driven by the systematic uncertainties, which largely dominates the statistical ones. Compared to the other observables (\(C_{l\to lej}\), \(C_{l\to W}\) and \(D_{l\to W}\)), \(D_{l\to lej}\) is the least affected by systematics. It allows to observe and measure Standard Model spin correlation with a precision of 13%. More optimistic/pessimistic assumptions on systematic uncertainties (section 5.2.4) have a small impact, and the precision remains close to 13%, in the 12-15% range. This assess the robustness of the result.

All above results were obtained with a \(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) luminosity. As already discussed in section 4, the luminosity may be \(2\cdot 10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) at the LHC start. In this case, two scenarii are considered in ATLAS: increase of the electron p\({}_{T}\) cut at the trigger level from 20 to 25 GeV (scenario 1), or even to 30 GeV (scenario 2). The complete study has been redone for both scenarii, assuming the same hypothesis for each source of systematic uncertainty presented in Figure 14. The number of events would be multiplied by 1.9 (1.8) for scenario 1 (scenario 2), while systematic errors remain unchanged. Consequently, the same sensitivity is achieved for \(C\) and \(D\) measurements.

## 6 Conclusions

The \(t\bar{t}\) spin correlation, which has never been observed, reflects fundamental interactions involved in the top quark production and decay. It offers an opportunity for precise tests of these interactions and possible deviations from the Standard Model. It is complementary to cross section measurements, as NLO QCD corrections and theoretical errors are much smaller.

The ATLAS sensitivity to \(t\bar{t}\) spin correlation observables (\(C\), \(D\)) has been studied in the semileptonic decay channel. Two spin analyzers can be used on the hadronic side, the least energetic jet in the top rest frame (\(leg\)) or the \(W\), while the charged lepton is used on the leptonic side. This results in four observables, called \(C_{l\to lej}\), \(C_{l\to W}\), \(D_{l\to lej}\) and \(D_{l\to W}\)

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l||c|c|c|} \hline  & Standard Model result & Sensitivity & Precision \\ \hline \hline \(C_{l\to lej}\) & 0.181 \(\pm\) 0.010 (stat) \(\pm\) 0.040 (syst) & 4.4 \(\sigma\) & 23\% \\ \(C_{l\to W}\) & 0.168 \(\pm\) 0.010 (stat) \(\pm\) 0.034 (syst) & 4.7 \(\sigma\) & 21\% \\ \(D_{l\to lej}\) & -0.142 \(\pm\) 0.006 (stat) \(\pm\) 0.018 (syst) & 7.5 \(\sigma\) & 13\% \\ \(D_{l\to W}\) & -0.127 \(\pm\) 0.006 (stat) \(\pm\) 0.024 (syst) & 5.1 \(\sigma\) & 19\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Their overall efficiency is 3%, _i.e._ 80 000 signal events in one year at low luminosity. The Signal Over Background ratio is 15. Selection and reconstruction bias the value of spin correlation observables. A method was set up to correct for this, and its robustness assessed.

The sensitivity of the measurement is driven by the systematic uncertainties, which largely dominates the statistical ones. Monte-Carlo and reconstruction sources contribute in the same proportion to the total uncertainty. The main contributions arise from the parton generation, FSR knowledge, \(b\)-jet energy scale and top mass uncertainty. The obtained sensitivity allows to observe and measure Standard Model spin correlation with a precision of 13% using \(D_{l\to lej}\), and around 20% with the other observables:

\[D_{l\to lej}=-0.142\pm 0.006(\mathrm{stat})\pm 0.018(\mathrm{syst}) \tag{10}\]

to be compared to the theoretical expectation of -0.148. Other hypothesis for systematic uncertainties and trigger scenarii very weakly impact on this result. The obtained precision sets the limit of sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model.

Appendix 1: \(\theta_{1}\), \(\theta_{2}\) and \(\Phi\) reconstruction

Angles \(\theta_{1}\), \(\theta_{2}\) and \(\Phi\) are computed in the following way [20]:

* Top and anti-top 4-momenta are reconstructed in the laboratory frame. Top and anti-top are unambiguously distinguished using the lepton sign.
* All particles are boosted from the laboratory frame to the \(t\overline{t}\) rest frame. This step is important to compare the results to theoretical expectations of [20]. Boosting directly, trough matrix \(A(w)\), from the laboratory frame to the top rest frame is not equivalent to boost via the \(t\overline{t}\) rest frame (through matrices \(A(u)\) and \(A(v)\)) : \(A(v)\cdot A(u)=R\cdot A(w)\) where \(R\) is a 4 x 4 matrix that is a pure 3-dimensional rotation (Wigner rotation).
* Top (anti-top) spin analyzing particle is boosted from the \(t\overline{t}\) rest frame to the top (anti-top) rest frame.
* \(\theta_{1}\) (\(\theta_{2}\)), the angle between the direction of the \(t\) (\(\overline{t}\)) spin analyzer in the \(t\) (\(\overline{t}\)) rest frame and the top (anti-top) direction in the \(t\overline{t}\) center of mass system, is computed.
* Similarly \(\Phi\), the angle between the direction of flight of the two spin analyzers, defined in the \(t\) or \(\overline{t}\) rest frames respectively, is computed.
