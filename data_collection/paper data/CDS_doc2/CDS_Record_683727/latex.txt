**ELS AGRAMENTS**

He de comencar pel comencament, i el comencament el dec a l'Enrique Fernandez, que fou qui em permete d'entrar en el mon de la Fisica d'Altes Energies, i mes concretament, en aquest mon mes petit (pero no menys complicat) que es lIFAE.

El treball que segueix a aquests agraiments m'ha permes de treballar amb tres dels seniors de l'IFAE, en Matteo, la Martine i en Manuel (qui a mes a mes ha estat el director d'aquest treball). De tots tres n'he apres molt i es difificil escollir unes paraules que diguin tot el que voldria dir. A mes a mes, tots ells han intentat ajudar-me en els moments de petita histeria, i es clar, per definicio d'histeria aixo no ha resultat facil. Dun admiro especialment la forma com gaudeix de la fisica i com fa que el altres tambe la gaudim quan ens troem a prop seu. De l'altre la seva capacitat de sinteesis en moments en que tots el petits problemes et fan perdre l'objectivu del teu treball (i sovint la paciencia tambe). I d'ella, crec que tots, grans, joves i petits, coincidim en que es una persona especial en el tracte personal i un exemple a seguir en el terreny professional.

El meu contacte amb la resta de seniors ha estat mes limitat, pero no per aixo els voldria deixar fora. A tots ells gracies, suposo que senzillament per formar part d'aquest entorn que es l'IFAE, i que sovint tots troebem a faltar quan en som lluny. Destacare nomes a Mokhtar, i suposo que entendreu perque, tots coneixem el seu esperit rebel que potser a vegetables el fa mes proper als estudiants, que en algun moment ens ha posat nervoisos a tots, pero que el fa especial.

He de dedicar un paragraf ("que sabe a poco") als que ja han marxat. L'Anna, en Frederic i el Federico. Poc puc dir de l'Anna que tots no haguem sentit algun cop, sempre un plaer ja sigui treballar o xerrar amb ella. Una persona que nomes en veure-la ja em sento una mica millor... una joia!. I en Frederic... un exemple per a tot aquell que vulgui seguir en aquest mon (per a mi?). He apres d'ell a anar fins el fons de les coses, procurar entendre allo que fem tan be com les nostres limitacions ens ho permeten (la discussio roman en si els homes i les dones podem arribar igual de lluny). I en Federico, doncs el vaig coneixer poc, pero crec que em vaig perdre molt.

Dels nou-vinguts haig de parlar de la Lluisa. La meva companya de despatx... sovint m'ha fet sentir malament en veure l'ordre de la seva meitat de despatx, pero aixo es l'unic queli puc retreure. El seu sentit de l'humor encara ara l'estic acabant de descobrir, i m'esta agradant.

I ara els estudiants, aquesta colla tan maca... sobre ells en podria escriure un capitol... potser encara ho fare... a tots moltes gracies per suportar els meus alts-i-baixos, sovint difficils de seguir fins i tot per a mi. Us esmentare que despres teniu gelets, i ho fare per ordre de vellesa (ja se que per ordre de bellesa seria mes succulent pero... aixo son uns agraiments seriosos): L'Aurelio, la Pili, l'Imma, l'Eugeni, en Gon, l'Hugo, l'Oscar i la Mireia, i l'Edu i en Xavi (que nomes son enginys, pero tot i aixi no estan malament). Sabeu, si mai ens deixem de veure us trobare a faltar.

Per acabar amb aquells que he conegut gracies a la fisica cal viatjar fins a Ginebra, al CERN. Alli he treballat, compartment la duresa d'un senyer anomenat Cs, amb Irene Vichou. Suposo que els moments de tensio als que s'ha arribat ens han fet coneixer-nos millor del que ens imaginavem, i encara continuem treballant juntes (i aixo es bo). I tambe vull esmentar a Tomas Davidek i Stanislav Nemecek que m'han ajudat amb tot allo que porta la paraula muons en augest treball.

De les terres de ponent hi ha molts noms que potser caldria posar. De fet, ara que penso en ells, alguns no pertanyen oficialment a les terres de ponent, pero aixo tan es. A tots vosaltres us he dit, potser no sempre amb paraules sino mes sovint amb petons i abarcades, mes coses que a ningu. O sigui que ja no dic mes, nomes els vostres noms: Lu, Gerard, David, Anouchka, Sorri, Solans, Gemma, les NENES i els NENS de la meva quinta, en Ton, el Quim, el Miguelito...

I els de Cerdo-City... especialment l'Edu i en David.

I la meva familia, la que m'ha tocat i, de fet, la millor que em podia tocar. A la meva mare li dec mes del que puc i vull reconeixer. I la resta... el millor home que existeix, el meu padr. La meva padrina, el meu padri jove, la Marta, el Paco, l'Anna i l'Alex.

I la meva segona familia: la Montse, el Rafel, l'Anna, el Jaume i el Paco.

## 1 Introduction

The LEP (Large Electron Positron collider) experimental program has confirmed the validity of the Standard Model up to energies of about 200 GeV. However, there are still questions to be answered in the Standard Model frame, such as the existence of the Higgs boson. Besides that, theories that go beyond the Standard Model predict the discovery of new physics at the TeV energy scale.

The LHC (Large Hadron Collider) is being built at CERN using the existing LEP tunnel and will have beams accelerated to the TeV energies. As it will be a proton-proton collider, the synchrotron radiation that limits the energy in an electron-positron circular collider such as LEP, will not be a significant problem. The collision energy will be about 14 TeV using magnetic fields of the order of 10 Tesla.

Since most of the physical questions to be answered involve interactions with very low cross sections, the maximum possible luminosity as well as a high energy is required. The LHC will reach luminosities of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s-1 with interbunch crossing times of the order of 25 nsec, which will result in more than \(10^{9}\) interactions per second.

ATLAS is one of the detectors designed to operate at the LHC and exploit its discovery potential. A steel-scintillator sampling calorimeter (TILECAL) is the ATLAS hadron calorimeter and will play an important role by providing measurements of jet energies and directions as well as missing energy measurements.

During 1996 and 1997 the first modules with real dimensions and equipped almost as in the final ATLAS design (they will be called module 0s), have been constructed and tested by exposing them to muon, pion and electron beams at the CERN SPS. They have also undergone calibration using electronic charge injection, laser light pulses and radiation from a \({}^{137}\)Cs source. The aim of this work is to show that the source calibration system satisfies the requirements of the final ATLAS design and to exploit the information that the data from this system gives about the light yield of the calorimeter. Also, a study of disuniformities in the calorimeter, which would affect the energy resolution, will be made.

This work is organised as follows: in Chapter 2 some general notions on electromagnetic and hadron calorimetry are given. In Chapter 3 the ATLAS detector is described, with emphasis on the Hadronic Tile Calorimeter. In Chapter 4 the calibration of the TileCalorimeter detector is reviewed. The experimental setups used in test beams during September 1996 and July-October 1997 are described in Chapter 5. In Chapters 6 and 7, the analysis of data obtained during these test beam periods is presented. Finally, Chapter 8 gives the conclusions of this study.
2.- Calorimetry

The principle of calorimetry is to perform the energy measurement of an incident particle by total absorption. In this chapter the basic processes for electromagnetic (e.m.) and hadronic showers will be described and some basic calorimeter concepts and limitations presented. Calorimeters are very suitable detectors at high-energy machines, such as LHC, since their intrinsic resolution improves with energy, in contrast to other detectors, for example magnetic spectrometers.

### 2.1 What is a calorimeter?

Conceptually, a calorimeter is a block of matter which intercepts the primary particle, and is of sufficient thickness to cause it to interact and deposit all its energy inside the detector volume. At sufficiently high energy, this involves the formation of a cascade or "shower" of an increasing number of lower energy particles. Eventually, most of the incident energy is dissipated and appears in the form of heat. Some fraction (usually very small) of the deposited energy is detectable in the form of a more practical signal (e.g. scintillation light, Cherenkov light, or ionisation charge), which is proportional to the initial energy.

Calorimetric particle detectors can be divided in two types: homogeneous calorimeters and sampling calorimeters. In the first, the particles release all their energy in an active medium, which provides the measurable signal. In sampling calorimeters only a fraction of the energy is released in the active medium, which is interleaved between layers of passive absorber medium.

The key parameters that characterise calorimeters are the repeatability of response ("statistical" response) which determines the energy resolution of a detector, and the average response as a function of energy and type of particle. For electrons and photons only the e.m. interactions are important, providing the basis for e.m. calorimeters. Hadrons, however, are mostly absorbed through hadronic interactions, and therefore hadronic calorimeters are fundamentally different from e.m. calorimeters. Muons deposit energy predominantly through ionisation and excitation, leaving a distinctly different signature. Neutrinos, which interact only weakly, are indirectly detected through the absence of any energy deposit ("missing energy").

#### Main properties of calorimeters

1. They are sensitive to charged and neutral particles. They often provide the only practical method for measuring neutral particles, such as \(\gamma\),n,\(\pi^{0}\),K\({}^{0}\),v.
2. The energy measurement is based on the total absorption of the incident particle through a series of inelastic collisions degrading its energy. The average number \(\langle\)N\(\rangle\) of secondary particles produced is proportional to the energy of the incident particle E. In principle, the uncertainty in the energy measurement is governed by statistical fluctuations in N, and hence the relative energy resolution \(\sigma\)/E improves as 1/\(\langle\)N\(\rangle\)-E\({}^{1/2}\).
3. The ideal calorimeter should contain the whole shower. Therefore, the depth of a calorimetric detector should match the scaling of the longitudinal shower profile, which is logarithmic with particle energy (see section 2.2). This can be compared to magnetic spectrometers, where the size scales with momentum as p\({}^{1/2}\), for a given relative momentum resolution \(\Delta\)p/p.
4. They can be segmented to a very high degree, which allows a precise measurement of the direction of the incoming particles.
5. Their different response to electrons, muons, and hadrons can be exploited for particle identification.
6. The energy information can be available on a relatively fast time scale, depending on the nature of the active medium. This feature is essential for online event selection ("triggering").

#### Readout systems for sampling calorimeters

1. _Light-collecting sampling calorimeters_ These are based on scintillating active media and the light is usually read by photomultipliers (PMTs). Renewed interest in such calorimeters started with the introduction of plastic scintillators and light-collection techniques using bars of wavelength-shifters (WLSs) to replace the technique of scintillator plates individually coupled to a light guide. Scintillation light crosses an air gap and enters the WLS, where it is absorbed and subsequently re-emitted at longer wavelengths. A fraction of this wavelength-shifted light is then internally reflected to the light detector. This scheme avoids complicated and costly optical contacts between the scintillators, and the light collectors, and minimises dead spaces.

2. _Charge collection readout._ The ionisation charge produced by the passage of the charged particles of the shower may be collected from solids, liquids, or gases. Solids and liquids can only be used in an ionisationchamber mode with no internal amplification. The best known and, to date, the only practical example is based on the use of liquid Argon. If gas is used as the active sampling medium, internal amplification using wire chambers is usually exploited. At high enough gas gains, with devices operating in a limited streamer mode, the measured signal is related to the number of shower particles which traverse the active medium.

### 2.2 Electromagnetic showers

The interaction of electrons or photons with matter is a multistep phenomenon in which various energy loss mechanisms take place, depending on the incident energy. There are two high-energy (E\(\geq\)100 MeV) e.m. energy loss mechanisms through which the e.m. cascade propagates. Electrons and positrons lose energy by radiation (bremsstrahlung, see figure 2.1), whereas photons produce electron-positron pairs (figure 2.2).

Figure 2.1: Energy loss mechanisms for electrons and positrons.

The cross sections for these processes are seen to be quite energy-independent for E \(\geq\) 100 MeV, justifying the assumptions of a constant cross section or constant mean free path between energy-degrading collisions. This picture leads to a one-dimensional cascade model, as sketched in figure 3.

Figure 3: One-dimensional cascade model of the e.m. shower

Figure 2: Photon cross section in lead as a function of photon energy.

In order to discuss e.m. calorimetry independently of the material used, it is convenient to introduce two quantities [1]:

* The critical energy, E\({}_{\rm C}\), is defined as the particle energy at which the loss by radiation is equal to the loss by ionisation. This can be parameterised as a function of the atomic number of the absorber by E\({}_{\rm C}\)\(\equiv\) (800 MeV)/(Z+1.2).
* The radiation length X\({}_{0}\) is defined as the distance in the absorber normalised to its density, over which the energy of the electron is reduced by a factor _1/e_ by bremsstrahlung only. The radiation length can be parameterised within a 5% accuracy as X\({}_{0}\) = 716.4A/[Z(Z+1)ln(287/\(\lambda\)Z)] g-cm\({}^{2}\) where Z is the atomic number and A the atomic weight. This can be well approximated by X\({}_{0}\) = 180 A/Z g-cm\({}^{2}\) for Z \(\geq\) 10.

This cascading process will continue until the energy of the components in the shower has reached the critical energy below which further multiplication stops. This simple model points to two remarkable features of the e.m. cascade. Given that the only dimensional scale of the problem is the radiation length X\({}_{0}\), it can be concluded that e.m. showers should all have the same longitudinal shape when the depth is expressed in units of X\({}_{0}\) for the given absorber material, i.e. the e.m. cascading depends essentially on the density of electrons in the absorber medium. This scaling in X\({}_{0}\) is rather well confirmed by observations (see figure 2.4).

Figure 2.4: Longitudinal shower development (left ordinate) of 6 GeV/c electrons in three very different materials, showing the scaling in units of radiation lengths X\({}_{0}\). On the right ordinate the shower radius for 90% containment of the shower is given as a function of the shower depth.

The simple one-dimensional model can also be used to predict that the depth of e.m. showers scales logarithmically with the initial particle energy E\({}_{\rm o}\). Assume that in the shower of figure 2.3, each bifurcation results in an even splitting of the initial particle energy amongst the two final ones. By proceeding in this way, after t radiation lengths, there will be 2' particles. Neglecting ionisation loss and the energy dependence of radiation and pair-production cross sections, the energy per particle at depth t will be E(t)=E\({}_{\rm o}\)/2'. This process continues until E(t)=E\({}_{\rm C}\), when ionisation energy loss suddenly becomes important and no further radiation is possible. The shower will thus reach a maximum and then cease abruptly. The maximum will occur at t=ln(E\({}_{\rm o}\)/E\({}_{\rm C}\))/ln2.

A more complete analytical description of the longitudinal shower profile has been given by Rossi [2] based on the following assumptions:

1. the cross section for ionisation is energy independent, i.e. dE/dx = -E\({}_{\rm C}\)/X\({}_{\rm 0}\);
2. multiple scattering is neglected and the e.m. cascade is treated one-dimensionally;
3. Compton scattering is neglected.

A convenient analytical description of the profile can be given in the form:

\[\frac{\rm dE}{\rm dt}=\rm E_{\rm o}b\frac{\left(b\right)^{-1}e^{-b\rm t}}{ \Gamma\left(a\right)}\]

where t= x/X\({}_{\rm 0}\), and a and b are parameters such that t\({}_{\rm max}\) occurs at (a-1)/b.

The transverse shower properties can also be easily understood qualitatively. In the early, most energetic part of the cascade, its lateral spread is characterised by both the typical angle for bremsstrahlung emission, \(\theta_{\rm brems}\sim\rm p_{\rm e}/m_{\rm e}\), and by the multiple scattering angle of electrons and positrons in the absorber. This latter process increasingly influences the lateral spread as the average particle energy decreases and causes a gradual widening of the shower. In the later development of the cascade, the radial shower dimension scales with the Moliere radius \(\rho_{\rm M}\)(which describes the average lateral deflection of electrons of energy e after traversing one radiation length). For the purpose of total energy measurement, the e.m. cascade occupies a cylinder of radius R \(\cong\) 2\(\rho_{\rm M}\), where \(\rho_{\rm M}=\) 21X\({}_{\rm o}\)/e \(\cong\) 7A/Z [g cm\({}^{-2}\)]. Typically an infinite cylinder of radius R contains 95% of the initial particle energy.

### Experimental requirements and limitations for electromagnetic calorimetry

The primary goal of calorimeters is energy measurement, but often position and angle measurements are also performed with them, as well as a certain degree of particle identification.

#### 2.3.1 Energy measurement

The most important aspects of energy measurement are linearity and resolution. Nonlinear response could be a major concern in experiments where particle energies cover a large range. For instance, in an LHC experiment, one has to measure electrons with a transverse energy from a few GeV (H \(\rightarrow\) e\({}^{\pm}\)) up to a few TeV (Z' \(\rightarrow\) e'e'). Non-linearity is often due to the electronics chain and can in principle be corrected offline. Operating in a high magnetic field can also be a source of poor linearity at low energy.

The energy resolution is commonly parameterized by the following quadratic sum:

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{a}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus\frac{b}{E}\oplus c\]

where a is the stochastic term (intrinsic resolution), b the noise term, c the constant term and E is expressed in GeV. Depending on the energy range involved in an experiment, the optimisation of these three parameters can be very different.

The intrinsic resolution is strongly linked to the technology used. The best performance is reached by homogeneous calorimeters. There the intrinsic resolution is given by the statistical fluctuation of the number of detected primary processes. The threshold of detection is usually small enough that the number of processes which give a useful signal is large and gives good intrinsic resolution. In general this fluctuations have to be convoluted with instrumental effects which dominate the resolution: efficiency of collection, lateral and longitudinal leakage, etc.

The resolution in sampling calorimeters is dominated by the sampling fluctuations in the total number of e\({}^{\pm}\) tracks crossing the sensitive layers. Using the Rossi approximations, the cascade development is modeled by the total track length T = E X\({}_{0}\)/E\({}_{C}\). For a sampling calorimeter the number of tracks intercepted in the gap is N = T/x =E/8E 2, where 8E is theenergy loss of a minimum-ionizing particle in one cell of thickness x. The energy resolution is given by the fluctuation in the number of tracks N:

\[\frac{\sigma(\mathrm{E})}{\mathrm{E}}\!=\!\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mathrm{N}}}\!\propto \!\sqrt{\frac{\delta\mathrm{E}}{\mathrm{E}(\mathrm{GeV})}}\]

The approximation used is enough to demonstrate the energy dependence of the resolution. As a very large fraction of the energy is deposited by low-energy electrons (MeV) in the high-Z material (absorber), the energy resolution is improved when decreasing the absorber thickness (\(\delta\mathrm{E}\) will be smaller for smaller thickness). This scaling law is valid as long as the absorber thickness is not so small that the crossing between consecutive layers are not correlated.

The (b) term of the energy resolution describes the noise and is dominant at low energy. Besides the electronics noise, a second contribution is important in LHC calorimeters: the pile-up noise. At the LHC design luminosity, about twenty soft collisions will be produced, on average, every bunch crossing, giving rise to so-called pile-up both in space and time. This reflects the high multiplicity of charged and neutral particles with a low average momentum (500 MeV/c) which impact in the calorimeter during each bunch crossing. The fluctuations in the mean value of this pile-up contribute as a noise term to the energy resolution.

The constant term (c), dominant at high energy, includes many contributions:

* Electronic non-uniformity, mainly due to the calibration of the cell-to-cell response.
* Mechanical non-uniformity, for example variation of the active and passive thicknesses as a function of position in sampling calorimeters.
* Signal variation with temperature or pollution of the active medium which may vary across the calorimeter or as a function of time.
* Lateral and longitudinal leakage.
* Degradation of the energy resolution due to the material in front of the calorimeter.

#### 2.3.2 Position and angular measurement

The partition of calorimeter readout elements in strips or towers has been widely used to find shower impact positions by centre-of-gravity methods. The energy resolution in each of the cells reflects in a position resolution which also scales as 1/\(\backslash\)E. For readout elements of relatively large size (as compared to the shower width at the depth where it is sampled) the method is biased, and requires correction factors. Resolutions as good as a few mm/\(\backslash\)E are possible in practical detectors.

There is much less experience in obtaining the shower direction from the calorimeter itself. The need for an angular measurement provided by the calorimeter has been stressed recently in the context of the H \(\gamma\gamma\) channel produced in pp collision at the LHC. The \(\gamma\gamma\) angle enters into the mass resolution, and since at high luminosity the vertex will not be known very precisely, it is necessary to measure this angle with the calorimeter. Such a measurement requires at least two segments in depth and a sufficiently long lever arm.

Detailed simulations of the ATLAS detector, as well as prototype studies, have shown that the required accuracy can be obtained combining tower readout for the shower core, with thin strip readout for the pre-shower part (first 4.5X\({}_{0}\)).

#### Particle identification

Rough particle identification is performed using the basis lateral and longitudinal shower profiles and comparing to these expected from e.m. vs hadronic shower. The demands are quite different depending on the desired physics process. For example, in the LHC environment the most difficult problem is the \(\gamma\)-jet identification. The required performance is driven by the search for the Higgs boson in the \(\gamma\gamma\) mode, for masses between 80 and 160 GeV. Backgrounds from misidentified jet-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet events add up to the irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) background and therefore reduce the sensitivity. However, using calorimeter cuts and information coming from the pre-shower, rejection factors close to the desirable can be reached.

### 2.4 Hadronic showers

In contrast with e.m. showers described by a cascade of electrons, positrons and photons interactions, hadronic shower development is more complex as it results from inelastic hadronic interactions which give rise to a cascade of various particles, illustrated in figure 2.5.

Figure 2.5 Hadronic shower development

A few hadronic shower characteristics can be distinguished:

* On average 30% of the incident energy is released as e.m. energy at 10 GeV, resulting mostly from \(\pi^{0}\), \(\eta\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\gamma\gamma\). This fraction increases with energy up to 60% for 150 GeV charged pions and has large fluctuations from one shower to another.
* The energy carried by muons and neutrinos, produced mainly from pion decays, escape the detection (1% of the incident energy at 40 GeV).
* A large fraction of the remaining energy, whose origin is from nuclear break-up (strong interaction), and is not detected, is dissipated in a variety of mechanisms. First, the binding energy used to break up the nuclei is lost and amounts to a few per cent of the incoming particle energy. A part of the energy loss may be recovered when neutrons are captured by other nuclei and give rise to a visible signal. Secondly the non-relativistic protons, \(\alpha\)'s, and heavy fragments produced suffer from energy loss saturation in scintillators or recombination effects in liquid argon ionisation chambers. Finally a large number of neutrons are produced in the break-up and spallation process. As they can lose their kinetic energy only by the strong interaction, they can travel far from the particle axis before being absorbed, with lifetimes as long as 0.5 \(\mu\)s. Some of them thus escape either the time or the space window used for the measurement. The fraction of undetected energy can be as large as 40% of the energy released in hadrons, with large fluctuations which dominate the energy resolution.

In order to describe hadronic shower shapes independently of the calorimeter material, it is convenient to introduce the interaction length, \(\lambda\), which is the mean free path between two inelastic nuclear interactions, and is given very roughly by \(\lambda\) = 35 g\(\cdot\)cm\({}^{2}\) A\({}^{1/3}\). Using this definition, the main characteristics of hadronic showers are:

* The longitudinal shower size increases slowly with energy with about 10 \(\lambda\) being required in depth for a 200 GeV hadron (see figure 2.6).
* 95% of the energy is contained in approximately a 1 \(\lambda\) radius. The lateral shape presents a narrow core due to the e.m. fraction of the shower development (about two Moliere radii) and a broad tail due to shower development driven by the strong interaction (see figure 2.6).

Hadronic calorimeters should clearly be much more massive than their e.m. counterpart (typically 2 m of iron as opposed to 15 cm of lead equivalent), imposing sampling calorimetry as the only affordable solution.

### 2.5 Energy resolution and limitations in hadronic calorimeters

As for e.m. calorimeters, one can parameterise the resolution by the relation defined in section 2.3.1. The first term, a, is the quadratic sum of sampling fluctuations and intrinsic resolution. The sampling fluctuations of hadronic showers are about twice as much as those obtained for e.m. showers with the same calorimeter. However, this contribution is small and the dominant one is the intrinsic resolution with its large fluctuation of the energy loss and the different behaviour of response of the various components of the shower. This can be related to the ratio of observed signal for the e.m. and non e.m. components of a hadronic shower, the so-called e/h ratio, which often deviates from 1.

The best energy resolution observed is about 40%/\(\sqrt{\mathrm{E}}\) but this deviates from the 1/\(\sqrt{\mathrm{E}}\) law, becoming worse at high energy. Two ways have been considered to improve the resolution of hadronic calorimeters. The first is to use software to estimate, on an event by event basis, the e.m. content of the shower and apply cell-by-cell weights when summing up the energy. This allows the restoration of the 1/\(\sqrt{\mathrm{E}}\) behaviour but it is difficult to maintain the energy response linearity.

Figure 2.6: Longitudinal (300 GeV) and lateral hadronic shower profiles.

The other way is to reduce the fluctuations by making the detector more sensitive to the nuclear binding energy loss and therefore make e/h \(\sim\) 1. These are called "compensating calorimeters". Various possibilities have been investigated:

* Use of U\({}^{238}\) fissile material as absorber. In that material some of the normally invisible energy expended in the nuclear break-up leads to neutron-induced fission, which in turn produces detectable energy in the calorimeter. Indeed the kinetic energy of the neutrons is strongly correlated to the binding energy loss.
* Use of plastic scintillators as the active material, because of their sensitivity to neutrons through elastic scattering on protons in the plastic molecules.

The second term in the energy resolution parameterisation, b, as well as the constant term, c, has the same contributions than the ones for the e.m. calorimeter, i.e. electronic noise and pile-up for the second term; and energy miscalibration, non-uniformities, leakage, etc. for the constant term.

The two LHC experiments have chosen hadronic calorimeters without compensation. The ATLAS central hadronic calorimeter is made of large scintillating tiles based on a sampling structure with interleaved steel absorber and scintillating plates read out by wavelength shifting fibres. With weights on the different compartments in depth (including the liquid argon calorimeter in front), the energy resolution with pions obtained in a test beam is 45%/\(\sqrt{\rm{E}+1.3\%}\).

Physics analysis does not only involve measurement of single particles, but also of jets of hadrons considered as the principal manifestation of quarks and gluons. In the multi-TeV hadron colliders the spectroscopy of particles in the 100 to 1000 GeV range will largely be done through the invariant mass determination of multijet systems. There are two distinct contributions to the resolution of this invariant mass determination. The first effect is associated with the physics of jet production. Jets, unlike single particles, are not unambiguously defined objects, but have to be defined operationally by a "jet algorithm". The second contribution to the mass resolution depends on the calorimeter performance itself and in particular on the momentum response to different particles. For very low energies of the jets (E\({}_{\rm jet}\)\(<\)5GeV), the jet resolution is dominated by the very non-linear response to low-momentum particles. At very high energies, the performance is dominated by the relative electron/hadron response. A large fraction of the jet energy is carried by only a few high-momentum particles; fluctuations in the charged hadron/\(\pi^{\rm o}\) ratio of these leading particles at sufficiently high energies will dominate over the simple statistical E\({}^{1/2}\) improvement.

## 3 The Tile Calorimeter for ATLAS

### ATLAS: The Overall detector concept

ATLAS is a general-purpose detector for high energy pp collisions, which will be installed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) being built at CERN. The LHC offers a large range of physics opportunities, including investigation of the mechanisms leading to symmetry breaking, as well as searches for heavy W- and Z-like bosons, supersymmetric particles, compositeness of the fundamental fermions, studies of CP violation in B-decays, and detailed measurements of top quark properties.

The overall layout of the ATLAS detector is shown in figure 1. Four detector subsystems will be described: the Magnet system, the Calorimetry, the Inner detector and the Muon spectrometer.

The magnet configuration is based on a superconducting solenoid around the inner detector cavity, and large superconducting air-core toroids consisting of independent coils arranged with an eight-fold symmetry outside the calorimetry. This concept offers:

* almost no constraints on calorimetry and inner detector allowing a wide choice of technological solutions;
* a high-resolution, large-acceptance and robust stand-alone muon spectrometer.

The inner detector is contained within a cylinder of length 6.80 m and radius 1.15 m, with a solenoidal magnetic field of 2 T. Pattern recognition, momentum and vertex measurements, and electron identification are achieved with a combination of discrete high resolution pixel and strip detectors in the inner part and continuous straw-tube tracking detectors with transition radiation capability in the outer part of the tracking volume.

Highly granular Liquid Argon (LAr) electromagnetic sampling calorimetry with excellent performance in terms of energy and position resolutions covers the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|\)\(<\)3.2. In the end-caps the LAr technology is also used for the hadronic calorimeter, sharing the cryostats with the electromagnetic end-caps. The same cryostats also house the LAr forward calorimeters which extend the \(\eta\) coverage to 3.2\(<\)\(|\eta|\)\(<\)4.9. The bulk of the hadronic calorimetry is provided by a scintillator tile calorimeter of novel geometry, which is separated into one large barrel and two extended barrel cylinders on each side. The whole calorimeter system contributes to the very good jet and \(\rm E_{T}^{\rm miss}\) performance of the detector. The LArcalorimetry is contained in a cylinder with an outer radius of 2.25 m and extends to \(\pm\)6.65 m along the beam axis. The outer radius of the Tile Calorimeter (TILECAL) is 4.25 m and its length is \(\pm\)6.10 m. A more detailed description of the calorimetry system can be found in the following section.

The calorimetry is surrounded by the muon spectrometer. The air-core toroid system, with a long barrel and two inserted end-cap magnets, generates a large field volume and strong bending power with a light and open structure which has minimal multiple scattering effects. The highest field regions are at the outer edges of the barrel and extended barrels, with the maximum value of \(-\)1.5 T located at the outer girder radius. The maximum value in the scintillator does not exceed 6\(\pm\)2 mT, and the influence in the light yield has been shown to be an increase of about 1%. Three stations of high precision tracking chambers with \(\sim\)60 \(\upmu\)m intrinsic resolution measure the coordinates of muons bending in the field. The muon instrumentation is complemented with fast trigger chambers. The outer chambers of the barrel are at a radius of about 11 m. The length of the barrel toroid coils is \(\pm\)13 m, and the third layer of the forward muon chambers, mounted on the cavern wall, is located at \(\pm\)21 m from the interaction point. The momentum resolution is typically 2-3% over most of the kinematic range apart from very high momenta, where it increases to \(-\)10% at \(\rm p_{T}\)=1 TeV.

Figure 3.1 The ATLAS detector

### 3.2 The ATLAS Calorimetry

The tasks of the calorimeters at hadron colliders are: accurate measurement of the energy and position of electrons and photons; measurement of the energy and direction of jets, and of the missing transverse momentum of the event; particle identification, for instance separation of electrons and photons from hadrons and jets, and of \(\tau\) hadronic decays from jets; and event selection at the trigger level.

The above will also be the main tasks of the calorimeters at the LHC, made more difficult, however, by the high luminosity and the large centre-of-mass energy (14 TeV), which requires good performance over an unprecedented energy range, extending from a few GeV up to the TeV scale. At the LHC design luminosity (10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{\text{-2}}\)s\({}^{\text{-1}}\)), about twenty soft collision will be produced, on average, every bunch crossing (i.e. every 25 ns), giving rise to so-called "pile-up" both in space and time. Fast detector response (\(<\)50 ns) and fine granularity are required to minimise the impact of the pile-up on the physics performance. High radiation resistance is also needed, given the high particle fluxes expected over a period of operation of at least ten years. The ATLAS calorimeter has been designed to meet the demands of the LHC physics program while operating in its very high luminosity environment.

Figure 3.2 shows the calorimeter layout. A barrel cryostat around the inner detector cavity contains, along decreasing radius, the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter and the solenoidal coil, which supplies a uniform magnetic field to the inner tracking volume. Two end-cap cryostats enclose the electromagnetic and hadronic end-cap calorimeters as well as the integrated forward calorimeter. The barrel and the extended barrel hadronic calorimeters are contained in an outer support cylinder, acting also as the main solenoid flux return, and consist of scintillating tiles and iron absorber plates. The outer radius of the flux return behind TILECAL is 4.23 m. The length of each end-cap cryostat is 3.25 m.

Figure 3.2: The ATLAS Calorimetry layout

### 3.3 The Electromagnetic Calorimeter

Many important physics processes at the LHC, such as the decay of Higgs bosons into photons or electrons, or the detection of new gauge bosons (Z' or W') decaying to electrons, place stringent requirements on the electromagnetic calorimetry in terms of acceptance, dynamic range, particle identification, energy resolution, and direction measurement.

The electromagnetic section uses lead absorbers in a liquid Argon ionization calorimeter implemented in an "accordion" geometry, both for the barrel (\(\eta\)|\(<\)1.4) and for the end-caps (1.4\(<\)\(\eta\)|\(<\)3.2). The longitudinal and transverse segmentation of the electromagnetic calorimeter allows an estimation of the shower shape and is therefore an essential tool in rejecting jet backgrounds. The segmentation of the electromagnetic calorimeter has been chosen to be \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\equiv\)0.025 \(\times\) 0.025 over most of the rapidity coverage (\(\phi\) is the azimuthal angle in radians). The first sampling (4.5 X\({}_{0}\)) has a much finer segmentation and therefore plays the role of a preshower device. The barrel part of the electromagnetic calorimeter is preceded by a presampler layer located immediately behind the cryostat inner wall. Measurement from the pre-sampler are used to correct for the energy lost in the material in front of the calorimeter (inner detector, coil, and cryostat) and to assist in measuring \(\eta\) for showers. The required resolution over the energy range of 10-300 GeV is a sampling term at the level of 10%/\(\backslash\)E(GeV) and a constant term that should be smaller than 1%.

### 3.4 The Hadronic Tile Calorimeter

TILECAL is a sampling device made out of steel and scintillating tiles, as absorber and active material respectively. The unique feature of this hadron calorimeter is the orientation of the scintillating tiles relative to the direction of the particles from the interaction point. The tiles point radially to the beam line and are staggered in depth to provide uniform sampling fraction.

The absorber structure is a laminate of steel plates of various dimensions, connected to a massive structural element referred to as a girder. The highly periodic structure of the system allows the construction of a large detector by assembling smaller sub-modules together. Since the mechanical assembly is completely independent from the optical instrumentation, the design becomes simple and cost effective.

Simplicity has been the guideline for the light collection scheme used as well: fibres are coupled radially to the tiles along the outer faces of each module. The use of fibre readoutallows the definition of a three-dimensional cell readout, creating a projective geometry for triggering and energy reconstruction. The readout of the two sides of each of the scintillating tiles into two separate photomultipliers (PMTs) guarantees a sufficient light yield and provides redundancy which may be needed during the long expected period of operation of the ATLAS experiment.

An electronics package is housed in the girder of each module. To allow access for maintenance and repair, the electronics are mounted in a drawer system which may be extracted from the module once the extended barrel calorimeter has been moved by about 1.5 m (once installed, the barrel calorimeter remains stationary).

#### The geometry of the Tile Calorimeter.

The calorimeter consists of a cylindrical structure with inner and outer radius of 2280 and 4230 mm respectively. The barrel part is 5640 mm in length along the beam axis, while each of the extended barrel cylinders is 2910 mm long. Each detector cylinder is built of 64 independent wedges along the azimutal direction. Between the barrel and the extended barrels there is a gap of about 600 mm, which is needed for the Inner Detector and the LAr cables, electronics and services. The barrel covers the region -1.0\(<\)\(\eta\)\(<\)1.0, and the extended barrels cover the region 0.8\(<\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<\)1.7

Figure 3.3: The principle to the Tile Calorimeter design.

Part of the gap contains the Intermediate Tile Calorimeter (ITC), an extension of the extended barrel which is a stepped structure in order to maximise the volume of active material in this region. It will also provide enough shielding for the muon system while leaving room for the services and cables.

TILECAL forms the shell of the inner part of the ATLAS detector. Once the barrel and the extended barrels are assembled, all the sub-detectors, except the muon system, will be placed within their volume. The massive iron structure should be rigid enough to support their weight, with the most important components being the full LAr cryostat with the solenoid.

The basic geometrical element is a period (see figure 3.4), which consists of two master plates (large trapezoids) 5 mm thick, and two sets of spacer plates (small trapezoids) 4 mm in thickness. The spacer plates are placed between the master plates such that to leave empty pockets where later on the 3 mm thick scintillator tiles are put (in the figure in black and grey).

The thickness of the calorimeter (always at least 9\(\lambda\)) is chosen such that the hadronic showers are well contained and that there is enough material to reduce the particle flux reaching the muon system. In addition, the ability to identify muons will help to recover the momentum resolution for low energy muons where energy loss in the material tends to dominate.

#### The optics of the Tile Calorimeter

Eleven sets of tiles of different radial sizes, pointing radially to the beam line, form the longitudinal segmentation of the detector. A pair of WLS (wavelength shifting) fibres, also running radially, collects light from the tiles at both of their \(\phi\) edges. Readout cells are defined by grouping together a set of fibres onto a PMT, to obtain three-dimensional segmentation. The \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) segmentation formed by the module geometry and scintillator cell

Figure 3.4: Exploded view of a period

structures is 0.1 \(\times\) 0.1. In the last radial layer, where hadronic showers will be broad, the segmentation is \(0.2\times 0.1\).

Ionising particles crossing the tiles induce the production of light in the base material of the tiles, with wavelengths in the UV range, which subsequently is converted to visible light by scintillator dyes. This scintillation light propagates through the tile to its edges, where it is absorbed by the WLS fibres and shifted to a longer wavelength (chosen to match the sensitive region of the PMT photocathode).

The driving philosophy behind the optics is to achieve and maintain a uniform, minimum light yield that achieves the required resolution. The necessary photostatistics corresponds to a photoelectron yield of 0.5 photoelectrons per minimum ionising particle (mip) per tile at normal incidence. Non-uniformity throughout the detector should also be kept small so as not to impact the constant term of the resolution. The baseline goal is an rms non-uniformity within a cell of less than 10%.

Finite photostatistics give a contribution to the calorimeter resolution, to be added in quadrature to the intrinsic sampling resolution. The requirement adopted is to be able to see the muon signal within each sampling depth. Therefore, the photoelectron yield must be of the order of 1 photoelectron (pe) per mip per tile. The photoelectron yield is a complex factor depending not only on the light output of the tiles, but also on the light collection efficiency, the PMT choice and the fibre choice.

Furthermore, the detector is expected to operate a minimum of 10 years. Typical ageing rates for a scintillator-WLS system is 1-3% loss of light per year. To provide a safety margin for ageing and other effects a requirement of a minimum light yield \(>\) 1.2 pe/mip/tile at production was set.

A non-uniformity of tile response can degrade the performance of the calorimeters. For example, if a random non-uniformity in the readout of the cells exists at the level of 10% (rms), an addition to the constant term can be expected up to about 1%. The radial fluctuations inside a cell due to the fact that more than one tile is read by the same fibre are of the order of 5% and cannot be improved without substantially increasing the number of fibres. So, to realise an overall non-uniformity of 10% rms, it will be necessary to keep non-uniformity inside a tile, tile-to-tile fluctuations and fibre-to-fibre fluctuations below 5%.

#### The Scintillator System

The scintillating tiles are the active medium of TILECAL. Light yield, uniformity of response within a tile and tile-to-tile uniformity are key performance issues. Each of the calorimeter sections will be equipped with tiles of the same dimension.

TILECAL contains 11 different sizes of trapezoidal shaped tiles, ranging from about 200 to 400 mm in \(\phi\) length and from 97 to 187 mm in radial width. The WLS fibres are placed in contact with the non-parallel edges of the tiles. The tile thickness is 3 mm. Each tile has two holes, 9 mm in diameter, through the surface for the passage of the calibration source tubes, which also serve as a mechanical fastener.

Commercially available optically transparent granulated polystyrene is used as the scintillation matrix base. The polystyrene is dried and then mixed with finely dispersed wavelength shifting dyes. The wavelength shifting process consists of a sequence of light absorptions and emissions in the chosen dye system. The dopants chosen were paraterphenyl (PTP) -1.5%- and POPOP -0.04%-. In a binary scintillator such as used in TILECAL, the initial radiation at the wavelengths 240-300 nm induced by the ionising particle is transmitted through the polystyrene lattice until it is absorbed by a primary fluor PTP molecule. PTP emits light in the range 320-400 nm, which is absorbed by POPOP and converted to a longer blue wavelength (around 420 nm and higher).

The uniformity of the light output of a tile depends on the local light yield uniformity and on the tile transparency. Fluctuations in tile properties depend on both the raw material properties and the stability of the molding machine operation. For example, the effective attenuation length, measured in terms of light from the fibre versus distance of the energy deposition from the end of the scintillator, depends on the material and also on the tile geometry and surface quality. The existence of internal stresses, flow lines and other plastic deformations seen in the tiles may affect their optical quality.

Before the scintillating tiles are inserted into TILECAL, they are wrapped with a covering material. The wrapper protects the optically reflective surface of the tile from contact with materials having an index of refraction which would spoil the internal reflection of the light. It also provides protection from mechanical damage and, in addition, enhances the light yield by redirecting some of the light which is not captured by internal reflectios back into the tile. To achieve a non-uniformity across the tiles below 5%, a pattern is printed on the wrapper with non-reflective ink near each fibre to absorb part of the light. Tyvek(tm), a material made of highdensity polyethylene fibres, has been chosen with respect to paper or other potential wrapping materials because of its high reflectance and toughness. The gain in light output is between 5 and 10%, compared to ordinary paper wrapping, and about 20% compared with unwrapped tiles.

##### 3.4.2.2 The WLS fibres.

Each fibre collects scintillation light from the edges of one or two tiles and transmits it to a PMT in the girder. This is accomplished by the fluor in the fibre which absorbs the blue light from the scintillator and re-emits it at a longer wavelength (480 nm or 495 nm depending on the manufacturer's choice of dopants). The light subsequently propagates along the fibre by total internal reflection. Ideally, the light collection should be efficient, fast, with low attenuation along the fibre and the fibres should be radiation hard. WLS fibres, 1 mm in diameter, doped with a fast (\(<\)10ns decay time) shifter have been chosen for the test modules.

The final choice of fibres has not been done yet, but double clad fibres have been chosen as they improve the light yield by a factor 1.2 to 1.5. As an example the double clad fibres Y11(200)Ms (from Kuraray, Japan, one of several types tested) are composed of a 0.896 diameter core, made of doped polystyrene with a refractive index of 1.59, an inner cladding 30 \(\upmu\)m thick made of PMMA with refractive index 1.49 and outer cladding 20 \(\upmu\)m thick made of fluorinated PMMA with refractive index 1.42.

Four fibres for the barrels and three for the extended barrels are required to read out one side of each half-period. In the barrel the fibre length ranges from between 85 cm and 210 cm, depending on which cell is to be read and the location of the half-period. In the extended barrel the fibre length ranges from 90 cm to 230 cm.

The WLS fibres have been selected to meet the following requirements:

* the absorption spectrum of the fibre should match the emission spectrum of the scintillator and the emission spectrum of the fibre should match the quantum efficiency of the PMT,
* the fibres should have maximum light yield and attenuation length,
* the fibres should be flexible and suffer minimum damage by stress due to curved paths,
* the direct fibre response (Cherenkov and scintillation light) to ionising particles should be small in order to avoid large signals from particles passing between modules,
* they should be radiation hard, for a total dose of 400 Gy,
* natural ageing over ten years should be negligible.

#### 3.4.2.3 Fibre routing.

As has been explained in the general layout of TILECAL, in the \(\phi\) direction the readout cell is naturally projective because of the wedge structure of the modules. Each module covers \(\Delta\phi\)=0.1. The modules are pseudo-projective in \(\eta\). The cell geometry for half of a barrel module is shown in figure 3.5 and for a full extended barrel in figure 3.6.

The light output of a cell depends on many parameters. One of the most important ones is the light budget, which is defined as the product of the tile response with the fibre response. The cells within TILECAL group several tile sizes and several fibre lengths, leading to non-uniformities of light output within a cell and amongst the cells themselves. It is the purpose of the fibre routing design to minimise these non-uniformities. The conditions that should be satisfied by the fibre routing design are:

* non-uniformity within cells should be minimised,
* light output should be maximised in order to keep photostatistics level,
* fibre length should be minimal for optimum light output, to minimise the volume of the fibre in the girder region and also to minimise the cost,
* non-uniformity amongst cells should be small to allow PMTs to have similar gains,
* the number of different fibre lengths should be small for an efficient fibre insertion procedure.

Figure 3.5: Cell geometry of half of a barrel moduleA more detailed description of the routing is left for chapter 5, as different routings have been implemented in the two test beams (for the Barrel Module 0 and the two Extended Barrels Module 0s). However the general scheme is explained here. The fibres arrive to the PMTs in a bundle, i.e. all the fibres reading one side of a cell are grouped in a bundle. These bundles are glued into the bundle tubes, that have previously been introduced in the bundle rings in the drawer. Later they are cut and polished with a precision of a few tenths of mm, such that the air gap between the end of the bundle and the PMT is slightly less than 1 mm. Each of the bundles arriving to a PMT is made up of different sub-bundles grouping a small number of fibres. The main difference between the different bundles is the way the sub-bundles are routed to their appropriate PMT.

#### The Electronics of the Tile Calorimeter

All front-end and digitising electronics are located in a cavity inside the girder, on a system of removable drawers containing up to 48 PMTs. Individual phototube HVs are locally regulated and derived from a voltage source common to the drawer. Pipelines and digitizers are located locally, and the digital information is transferred to the Readout Drivers (RODs) in the counting room via a few cables or optical fibres.

Figure 3.6: Cell geometry of a extended barrel module.

The only electronics outside the drawers are located in the electronics room, and consist of the HV source power supply, the Level-1 trigger (LVL1), the Tile Calorimeter Readout Drivers, and the control electronics for the three calibration systems. The general scheme of the calorimeter readout is given in figure 3.7.

The dynamic range of the electronics is determined at the high end by the requirement that the calorimeter must be able to measure energy depositions up to 2 TeV in a single cell. At the lower end, it should be able to measure the signal from muons, which deposit 0.5 GeV in the thinnest cell.

The contribution to the resolution of the readout system must be small compared to the intrinsic energy resolution of the calorimeter. For hadrons that interact only in TILECAL, the resolution has been measured to be:

\[\sigma/\mathrm{E}=47\%/\sqrt{\mathrm{E}}+2\%\]

Thus an electronic precision of eight bits (0.4%) is adequate for the highest signals.

Figure 3.7: General scheme of the Tile Calorimeter Readout.

3.- The Tile Calorimeter for ATLAS

**3.4.3.1 Mechanical considerations**

The calorimeter readout is mounted in a system of drawers. Each drawer houses up to 24 PMT blocks and supports the electronic boards which are connected to each PMT block. It also provides the high voltage to the PMT voltage dividers and the low voltages to the HV regulator and other electronic card. A variety of control and calibration signals are generated within the drawers. They also contain electronics to process the signals coming from the fast pulse shapers and the integrator used for calibration (see below).

**3.4.3.2 PMT Blocks**

The PMT subsystem contains a light mixer, a phototube, a divider and a so-called 3-in-1 base. The PMT block is contained within a cylindrical shell which acts as magnetic shielding.

The PMTs

The main characteristics of the PMTs are a nominal gain of 10\({}^{5}\) with full efficiency with a high voltage of less than 1,000 V; a quantum efficiency of more than 18 % at 480 nm; a dark current at nominal gain smaller than 1 nA; and a maximum non-linearity of 2% for pulses of 15 ns and 50 mA currents.

To enable individual adjustment of the PMT gains, while maintaining a reasonable cost for power supplies, the high-voltage power is organised into two stages. First, a general HV power supply provides a single voltage to each drawer. Then, within the drawers, controllers using optocouplers distribute individual voltages to the PMTs. The external HV power supplies provide 10 mA at 1 kV. The individual HVs are stabilised to better than 0.1%.

Light mixers

Most PMTs exhibit large variations in response over their photocathode surfaces, but the signal corresponding to light coming from the various fibres inside a given bundle must be independent of the fibre location at the photocathode. The role of the light mixer is to scatter the light coming from the fibres so that there is no correlation between the position of a fibre and the area of the photocathode which receives its light.

The light mixers must have the following characteristics: uniform light output at a level of at least 90% to destroy information about the position of the fibres in the bundle; high light acceptance; light attenuation of a few percent; short length to provide space for the 3-in-1 base and to provide an air gap of less than 1 mm between the PMT block and the fibre bundle; and no Cherenkov light from incoming particles.

A square light guide with a length of 1.9 times its side and with a face that is fully contained by the photocathode exhibits the best performance. This corresponds to a length of 35 mm and a face of 18\(\times\)18 mm\({}^{2}\) for the chosen PMTs. The maximum variations in uniformity are about 10%.

From an optical point of view, air gaps introduce a sizeable loss of light. However, this loss is stable and independent of the size of the gap, as long as it is within a range of \(\sim\)1 mm. This value is sufficient to allow mechanical movement of the drawers.

3-in-1 boards

The 3-in-1 boards in the PMT block form the front-end of the electronics readout chain. They provide 3 basic functions: pulse shaping and accommodation of the large dynamic range, charge injection calibration, and slow integration of the PMT signals for monitoring and calibration. They are located inside the steel shield of the PMT. This location of the front-end electronics provides an operating environment shielded from electrical noise and magnetic fields. The ambient radiation levels are low and the thermal stability inside the steel girder is excellent.

3.4.3.3 Fast pulse electronics

The fast readout electronics must process signals from 10,110 PMTs every 25 ns. These signals have a dynamic range of 16-bits and a precision of 10-bits. Signals corresponding to the energy in the 2000 calorimeter trigger towers must be formed and sent to the LVL1 trigger electronics on every beam crossing. During the 2.5 microsecond latency of the LVL1 trigger, the individual calorimeter signals are stored. Following the latency period, data from events accepted by the LVL1 trigger are passed to readout driver modules (RODs) for further processing. Signals from beam crossings failing the LVL1 trigger are discarded.

Two approaches have been considered for signal storage during the LVL1 latency; either digital or analogue storage. The digital approach offers straightforward use of digital memories but requires processing each signal with a fast ADC every 25 ns. The alternative approach is to store analogue signals on a capacitor for 2.5 microsecond and to digitise only the signals of events passing the LVL1 trigger.

For TILECAL, with its relatively modest number of channels and low channel density, the approach of digital storage has been developed (particularly for the module 0s test beam activity). Two baseline designs were tested, one using a non-linear compression scheme followed by a single ADC and a lookup table to restore linearity and the other using a linear dual-gain pulse shaper and two commercial 12-bit ADC chips per channel (this is called the bi-gain design). The bi-gain design has been chosen for the final ATLAS design.

### 3.5 Calibration, monitoring, and testing.

It is aimed to achieve a 2% constant term in the energy resolution of a system with 10,000 channels. This requires the calibration of each cell to be carefully established and monitored with time. A combined system of radioactive source calibration (that "sees" the optics and the PMTs, and has its own electronics), pulsed laser calibration (that "sees" the PMTs and the standard readout electronics), and electronic charge injection (for the readout electronics) is planned. Together, they monitor the scintillators, fibres, PMTs and readout chain and should help to identify the source of any variation and to ensure cell-to-cell uniformity.

PMT gain drifts will be monitored using a YLF solid state laser. This generates light pulses with a width of about 15 ns and a wavelength of 523 nm, which are similar to the signals from the WLS fibres. The intensity of each light pulse is measured by a set of photodiodes and the photodiodes and the associated electronics are in turn monitored by an \({}^{241}\)Am source. It is foreseen to pulse the laser during the bunch-free periods. Trains of light pulses of increasing intensity will span the entire calorimeter dynamic range.

The detector will be calibrated periodically with a radioactive source and continuously with the current induced by minimum-bias events from the pp collider. In the source-monitoring mode, the readout speed is limited by the source advancement speed (about 30 cm/s). Under these conditions, and with the anticipated number of sources, the whole calorimeter can be calibrated in about 8 hours. In contrast, the time to read out the calorimeter minimum-bias current ranges between milliseconds and seconds depending on the chosen readout architecture.

The readout system must undergo electronic testing and calibration. This applies to both the fast readout and that of the slow integrators. The tests are to ensure the proper functioning of all elements of the system and also to determine the calibration constants and non-linearities of the individual channels. For this testing a variable current will be injected into the input of each analysis channel.

## 4 Calibration of the Tile Calorimeter

In order to translate calorimeter signals to particle or jet energies one needs:

* to determine the overall energy calibration scale, i.e. the factor that relates the energy released in the calorimeter to the digitised signal produced at the end of the readout chain,
* to measure this calibration factor for each readout channel, and/or to minimise its channel-to-channel variation,
* to monitor this set of calibration factors over the lifetime of the detector in order to correct for their variations in time.

### Overall Energy calibration scale

Calibration is a major concern in large systems like the ATLAS calorimetry, consisting of several different subdetectors with a large number of channels. In particular, a small constant term and a precise determination of the absolute energy scale, both in the e.m. and hadronic calorimeter, will be needed to exploit the physics potential at the LHC. To achieve these goals, the calibration of the calorimeters and the determination of the absolute energy scale will proceed in several steps:

1. The e.m. and hadronic calorimeter will be equipped with precise and reliable calibration systems, able to continuously monitor the behaviour of the optics and electronics over the full dynamic range.
2. Several calorimeter modules, both for the e.m. and hadronic parts, will be studied with test beams during the construction phase. This allows to spot problems in the construction, to check the uniformity of response, the reproducibility from module to module, to tune Monte Carlo simulations, etc.
3. Residual non-uniformities inside the whole detector when mounted cannot be excluded. These can be attributed, for instance, to the non-uniformity in the material distribution in front of the e.m. calorimeter, temperature gradients, mechanical deformations, etc. Furthermore, it will be necessary to transfer the single-pion calibration to the calorimeter response to particle jets produced in the pp collisions. Therefore, _in situ_ calibration with physics events will be needed, and may eventually be the most powerful calibration tool, as has been demonstrated by the Tevatron experiments [1][2].

In both the e.m. and hadronic calorimeters, the relation between the jet energy scale and the mass scale can depend on the algorithms used and on instrumental effects.

The contribution of the calibration to the constant term has been studied and will be an important subject. For example, test beam experience for the e.m. calorimeter has shown that a constant term of 0.45% can be achieved in a region of \(\Delta\eta\)\(\times\)\(\Delta\phi\)=0.2\(\times\)0.4. However, within the calorimeter acceptance used for precision measurements there are 400 such regions. Even if inside each region a local constant term of 0.45% was achieved by construction, possible non-uniformities from region to region cannot be excluded. The same thing happens for the hadronic calorimeter. For those modules which will be directly exposed to test beams, part of these non-uniformities can be measured and corrected for. However, non-uniformities due to dead material or other real experiment conditions cannot be corrected with test beam data. This is why the _in situ_ calibration with physics events will be needed. The energy scale has not only to be propagated in the non-uniform regions within a calorimeter, but also between the different sub-detectors of the ATLAS detector.

#### The energy scale for the e.m. calorimeter

Several physics channels will be used to calibrate the e.m. calorimeter. The main tools will be Z \(\rightarrow\) e'e' events, which give a standalone method for the e.m. calorimeter calibration, and E/p measurements for electrons, which on the other hand requires the use of the inner detector and a knowledge of its momentum scale to better than 0.1%. J/\(\Psi\)\(\rightarrow\) e'e' and Y \(\rightarrow\) e'e' decays will allow to set the scale in the low-energy domain, whilst high-p\({}_{\rm T}\) Z \(\rightarrow\) e'e' events will most likely allow to cover energy ranges up to several hundred GeV. Additional uncertainties may arise when transferring the electron energy scale to the photon energy scale, and \(\gamma\gamma\) events where one photon converts to an e'e' pair could possibly be used to minimise such effects.

#### The energy scale for the hadronic calorimeter

Several methods must be envisaged to calibrate the hadronic calorimeters, and more in general to set the jet energy scale. The difficulty comes from the already mentioned transfer of the single-pion response to the jet response, and from the different types of jets (gluon, light-quark, b-quark), which require separate calibration given their different particle multiplicities, lepton content, etc.

\(\tau\) lepton decays are a potential source of isolated hadrons, whose momentum vector p can be accurately measured in the tracking detectors. Since their energy E will be measured in the calorimeter, the relation E/p=1 can be used to adjust the absolute energy scale for pions. Alsofor the hadronic calorimeters, the E/p measurement with single pions is potentially a useful tool for cell-to-cell calibration.

Information from \(\gamma\)+jet and \(Z^{\rm p}\)+jet events can be used to transfer the energy scale from the e.m. calorimeter and inner detector to the hadronic calorimeters through \(\rm p_{T}\)-balance. In these samples, selection of events where the jet is a b-quark would provide the b-jet scale as well. One of the limitations due to systematic effects is that the \(\gamma\)+jet sample contains a significant amount of background (especially for low \(\rm p_{T}\)). Also both contain a mixture of quark and gluon jets and an accurate calibration will require the disentangling of systematic differences between the quark and gluon jet energy scales, which are expected to be different since gluon fragmentation is broader (with higher particle multiplicities) than the light quark fragmentation. Also, the jet veto together with the effect of final state radiation may produce some bias in the \(\rm p_{T}\) balance.

The use of \(\rm W\to jet\)-jet decays, given the precise knowledge of the W mass, is most probably the best calibration method to be applied in top-mass measurements, and more generally for dijet and multijet mass spectroscopy. At a luminosity of \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{2}\)s\({}^{1}\), hundreds of thousands of W bosons from top quark decays will be reconstructed each year. This sample will provide a great opportunity to calibrate the absolute jet energy scale of the ATLAS calorimeters, but the overlap of the two jets for energetic Ws will need thorough studies to choose the best algorithm and control systematic effects. However, given the large number of events in these "control samples" at the LHC, the ultimate precision on the energy scale will most likely be dominated by systematic effects, related more to the knowledge of the physics (background, presence of additional jets in the event, underlying event) than to the comprehension of detector effects. Thanks to the availability of high statistics data samples a detailed study of the detector effects will be possible, and will give the possibility of correcting them to a certain extent.

### 4.2 Intercalibration and monitoring

The overall response of the calorimeter can be divided into light response (energy deposition + tiles + fibres) and charge response (gain + quantum efficiency of the PMTs), as shown in figure 4.1. In principle, these responses will change in time. The light may change due to ageing processes of the scintillators and fibres, or to radiation damage. These changes are typically slow, with time constants of hours to months. Other possible changes of the light yield, such as deterioration of optical contact, may be more abrupt. The photomultiplierresponse may change due to gain drifts (typically occurring over hours to days), deterioration of gain or quantum efficiency (much slower except for excessive signal loads), etc.

The intercalibration and monitoring strategy for the TILECAL is based on several tools:

* movable radioactive sources which excite light in all scintillators by some of the same mechanisms as particles produced in LHC interactions,
* a laser which produces on each PMT a light pulse which closely mimics calorimeter pulses,
* during data-taking at the LHC, continuous monitoring of the signal produced in the calorimeter by minimum bias (MB) interactions.

The requirements on the precision of the monitoring and of the intercalibration of the calorimeter readout cells are different:

* For monitoring the calorimeter response a precision of about 1% is useful for early detection of any degradation phenomena.
* Requirements on the intercalibration of the readout cells must be set in terms of the overall resolution of the calorimeter, and as explained in section 3.2.3 they turn to be much less stringent than 1%.

#### The laser system.

The main purpose of the laser system is to monitor the response of the PMTs on any desired time scale, from the very shortest (minutes) to the duration of the ATLAS experiment. It is planned to obtain the PMT gain to a relative precision of 0.5% by measuring the laser light intensity pulse by pulse. This system will also be useful to check the pulse electronics following the PMTs.

Figure 4.1: Conceptual diagram of signal path for the Tile Calorimeter and calibration entry points.

The core of this system is a computer-controlled frequency-doubled YLF3 solid-state laser in which the light pulses are externally triggered and intensity-modulated. The laser pulses closely mimic the scintillating light produced by particles in the calorimeter, having a wavelength of 480 nm and a pulse width of about 15 ns.

Footnote 3: The frequency of the infra-red light emitted by the laser head has to be doubled to a green light to match the quantum efficiency of the PMTs. YLF stands for Ytrium Lithium Fluoride

The laser pulse intensity is precisely measured on a pulse-by-pulse basis by photodiodes. The linearity of the photodiode readout electronics is checked with a charge injection system; the response of the photodiodes is monitored with an \({}^{241}\)Am alpha source, which provides a reference that is stable in time and insensitive to environmental changes.

Laser calibrations are performed generating a train of 16 pulses of increasing amplitude, reaching the upper end of the PMT dynamic range. The light is transmitted to the PMTs through clear fibres, which are bundled together with the WLS fibres reading the scintillator tiles in the modules (each fibre bundle will contain two clear fibres). The effective dynamic range of the laser in this mode is only about 30, whereas the calorimeter dynamic range in ATLAS is about 60000. To obtain this range a set of remotely controlled filters will be installed on the laser light path. Amplitude monitoring and timing measurements are made upstream of these filters.

#### Monitoring the minimum bias current.

LHC detectors will have to cope with a background of inelastic proton-proton collisions at small momentum transfers, that will produce non-negligible occupancies in all detectors. These processes lead to the so-called Minimum Bias (MB) events, which manifest themselves as noise in the calorimeters that limits their performance. However, these processes can also be used to continuously monitor the response of TILECAL.

The rate of energy deposition by MB processes is proportional to the LHC luminosity and is uniform in azimuthal angle, but is moderately dependent on \(\eta\) over the range spanned by TILECAL. It produces a signal in the PMTs that is usually large enough to be recorded with inexpensive electronics by measuring the anode current averaged over a time scale of milliseconds.

The proportionality to the LHC luminosity depends on clean running conditions, i.e. on the absence of appreciable contributions from beam losses due to beam-gas or beam-wall scattering. Under these conditions the average current in each readout cell divided by the instantaneous luminosity gives a number proportional to the overall response of the calorimeter, that should be constant in time. Any variation of the MB current to luminosity ratio can be compared to information from the laser and movable source systems to understand the behaviour of the calorimeter in time and correct for it.

The MB signal provides a manner to continuously monitor the response of the calorimeter because it can be read out during physics runs without interfering with normal data acquisition. This is because the quasi-DC component of the PMT anode signal is picked off without disturbing the fast pulse shaper.

#### Source intercalibration and monitoring system

The Tile Calorimeter is designed to allow a movable source to pass through every scintillator tile. Each scintillator tile has two holes along the symmetry axis; the source guide tube is usually inserted through one of them. The current induced in a PMT reading one cell is proportional to the amount of energy deposited in the calorimeter, the light yield for that particular cell and the quantum efficiency of the PMT. The use of a movable \(\gamma\) source allows checking the quality of the optical response and its uniformity, to equalise the response of all readout cells by adjusting the HV of the corresponding PMT, and to monitor in time the average current of each cell.

A precision of 1% is useful for the response monitoring for reasons of early detection of any degradation. For the cell intercalibration a weaker than 1% precision is needed, driven by the fact that a 5% random cell miscalibration would add 1.5% quadratically to the constant term of the energy resolution for pions and less than 1% for jets.

The concept of the movable source calibration scheme is shown in figure 2. In the way the system was realised for both barrel and extended barrel module 0s (first modules with real dimensions tested in summer of 1997 and 1998, respectively), an 8 mCi \({}^{137}\)Cs source excites sequentially the scintillators of a readout cell by running along tubes which pass perpendicularly through holes in the tiles. Using a JFET-input operational amplifier with a few msec integrating time constant, the signal is converted to voltage with a negligible ripple. The time constant should be of a few msec in order to clearly see the peak-valley structure. If the speed of the source is of about 30 cm/s, and the width of a tile is of 3 mm, then 10 ms is the approximated time that the source spends under each tile. This is the reason why a time constant of about 10 ms would be a good value. The source induced current is measured about every 3 mm, giving 6 points per tile.

A typical picture of the source passage through 5 readout cells of the calorimeter is shown in figure 3. The multiple peak structure in the response of each PMT is due to the passage of an 8 mCi \({}^{137}\)Cs source through individual tiles; a case of faulty light collection from one tile is clearly seen. The capability to see individual tiles is due to the mean free path of the Cs gammas, which is of the order of the 18 mm separation between tiles. This figure demonstrates the power of source scans for testing the quality and uniformity of the calorimeter. The source can "see" every scintillating tile, and therefore can be used to obtain an "x-ray picture" of the response. Source scans will also be used to control the optical quality of modules in time to correct possible assembly faults.

Figure 2: Mechanical concept of the source calibration system

The movable source system is the main tool to equalise the response of the calorimeter readout cells within a module, and between different modules. This is done by adjusting the high voltage of each PMT to obtain the same average signal from each cell. The averages are obtained online from a computer controlled scan of each cell, giving response curves like those of figure 4.3. The average is simply obtained by summing the measurements over a cell, subtracting the baseline and dividing by the width of the cell. The average response values are measured again at later times, providing information about the stability of the overall calorimeter response and also the cross-calibration information for the analysis of data.

A movable source system allows to use just a few sources to calibrate the whole TILECAL. For long-term monitoring of the calorimeter response, the precisely known decay rate of the activity of sources is of course extremely useful.

The design of the movable source system must allow to do source scans of the entire TILECAL at any desired time after assembly of the full detector. Such a system must satisfy the following requirements:

* It must be remotely controlled.
* The movable source system and its controls must operate over the duration of ATLAS with minimal access to the detector. A consequence of this requirement is that all system

Figure 4.3: Current measured in the PMTs as a function of the source position along the rod (z axis)

components that may need maintenance or replacement must be located outside the detector.
* Installation, operation and maintenance must not produce unacceptable radiation exposure to personnel and equipment.
* In case a source stops anywhere on its path, it must be possible to move it to a safe location without dangerous exposure to people or equipment and without significant loss of time.
* A full source scan must be done during short beam down periods. This time should not exceed 8 hours; considering that a path scanning all tiles in the barrel is of approximately 4,000 m -neglecting interconnections-, this requirement translates into a minimum source velocity of 15 cm/sec.
* The capability to perform partial scans is desirable.

##### The radioactive sources

General requirements on the sources are:

* \(\gamma\) energy must be high enough to allow attenuation through the 1 mm thick steel tubes lower than 10%, in such a way that the variation of the useful flux due to tolerances on the tube thickness is less than 1%.
* the lifetime of the source must be sufficiently long to permit at most one replacement over the lifetime of ATLAS, including the construction phase.
* the activity in a volume not exceeding 5 mm\({}^{3}\) should be sufficient to produce average currents of more than 10 nA at the photomultiplier anodes.
* the contamination by short-lived isotopes must not introduce an uncertainty of more than 1% in the gamma flux relative to the initial value.

\({}^{137}\)Cs (E\({}_{\bar{r}}\)=0.662 MeV, t\({}_{1/2}\)=30.2y) satisfies all these requirements. The activity density requirements arises because it is desirable for the source to extend less than 3 mm - the thickness of scintillating tiles - as illustrated in figure 4.4. Finally, commercially available \({}^{137}\)Cs from nuclear fuel reprocessing contains a small enough contamination of the short-lived \({}^{134}\)Cs isotope (with t\({}_{1/2}\)=2.9y) to meet the last requirement.

#### The Current Integrator.

The charge integrator is located on the 3-in-1 card, and is designed to measure the average current of each calorimeter cell due to the energy deposits from the radioactive source, or from MB interactions. The currents from the PMTs must be averaged over a time scale which is long enough to suppress the ripple from individual pulses, as well as fluctuations in the amplitude and rate of energy deposits in each cell.

The PMT current induced by an 8 mCi source corresponds mostly to single photoelectrons at a rate of about 4 MHz giving an average current of about 50 nA at the nominal PMT gain of \(10^{5}\). The mean current is measured with a current integrator that has a cut-off frequency much below the 4 MHz pulse rate. In order to observe the signal variations as the source moves across the tiles at the design velocity of 300 mm/s, the integrator requires a defined bandwidth. The tile period is 18 mm, and then the maximum signal variation frequency is:

\[\mathrm{f=}(300\mathrm{mm/s})/(18\mathrm{mm})=16.7\ \mathrm{Hz}.\]

Because the cell intercalibration procedure is based on an integral process, the amplitude of these variations is not critical, however it is important to see properly these oscillations in order to detect optic defects such as broken fibres or bad couplings. A time constant of 10 ms corresponds to a bandwidth of 17 Hz and is sufficient for this qualitative check.

The dynamic range requirements are set by the range of MB currents anticipated as the LHC luminosity increases from an initial value of about \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{\text{-2}}\)s\({}^{\text{-1}}\) to a maximum of

Figure 4.4: Source location with respect to irradiated tile; the influence of the source length of the efficiency of the system. The hashed area is the tile material.

\(10^{34}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\). The minimum-bias current also varies with radial distance from the interaction point, and with \(\eta\). Taking into account all the dependencies, the expected currents cover a range between 5 nA and 500 nA.

The slow current integrator output is digitised by a 12 bit ADC that has an input dynamic range of 5 V. The overall range expected for MB currents does not allow to cover the whole currents range with a resolution of about 1% (5 to 6 bits). In consequence, the transimpedance of the slow current integrator has to be programmable to different values chosen according to the calorimeter depth and LHC luminosity (the required resolution is fixed such that the smallest expected minimum bias current will be converted into 40 counts).

An integrator time constant of 10 ms is adequate for the source calibration system to limit far below 1% the fluctuations due to the stochastic nature of the source emission. The MB current fluctuations are larger because of the tail of the energy spectra and a time constant of about 100 ms will be needed. For this, a larger time constant is foreseen at the digitizer input stage, allowing to scan all the MB induced currents for a superdrawer in about 25 ns.

The circuit is build around a low cost LF411CD JFET input stage operational amplifier (see figure 4.5). Bandwidth and noise are not limiting factors because of the low frequency response of the circuit. The circuit is DC coupled to the PMT anode through a net that is compatible with the shaper specifications. The programmable high gain is achieved with a switched T feedback network, however the high impedances used make the circuit sensitive to electromagnetic interferences that have to be handled carefully. The multiplexing facility is achieved by a local output switch. The device is controlled by the 3-in-1 controller that sends the appropriate commands through the 3-in-1 bus. The commands are decoded and processed by the local logic of the 3-in-1 cards.

#### 4.2.3.3 System design for ATLAS.

Based on the encouraging results obtained with a prototype of the hydraulic drive concept, a movable source system for the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter has been designed using this approach. The system will be composed of three independent parts, for the barrel and the two extended barrels respectively; these parts are identical in principle and design philosophy, differing only in the details of the layout. Each part is composed of a closed source circuit that passes through every tile of every module, and contains one source.

The drive liquid accesses each circuit through supply/return lines that divide the source circuit into a number of segments; the liquid enters or exits the calorimeter through only two

Figure 4.5: Slow current integrator schematic.

of these lines at any time. The moving liquid column spans only a few modules at a time, which keeps the pressure drop across the segment conservatively low values.

A total of 64 supply/return tubes connect the movable source system to the body of the calorimeter. Within the Tile Calorimeter itself, the main hydraulic components are:

1. The straight calibration tubes passing through the modules.
2. About 2000 curved tube sections, joining the straight tubes to form the source circuits.
3. The tee joints, connecting the supply/return tubes to the source circuit.
4. Three source garages in the barrel and two garages in each external barrel
5. Source passage sensors and local readout electronics.

The general layout of the source circuit and the garages in the barrel is shown in figure 4.6. The supply/return tube bundles are brought to a point at the outer radius of the Tile Calorimeter and reach the appropriate tee-joints around the external circumference of the barrel. The garages are symmetrically located around the barrel circumference to minimise the time to return the source to a garage (moving in either direction).

## 5 The Experimental Setups

The results presented in this study were obtained with data taken during August and September 1996 and from July of 1997 to March of 1998. During the first period the Barrel Module 0 (BM0) was tested, and during the second two Extended Barrel Module 0s (EB0s) were tested. These were the first prototypes with correct dimensions and equipped almost as in the final ATLAS design.

### The Barrel Module 0

The Barrel Module 0 was constructed in 1996. Half of the module was equipped and tested in August and September of the same year. The detector was positioned in the H8B area (beam coming from the SPS) in standalone mode (i.e. without the electromagnetic calorimeter in front). The module was mounted on a scanning table, which provided accurate movements in all directions. Five one meter prototype modules built in previous years were placed on either sides (in \(\phi\)) of BM0, three on one side and two on the other as shown in figure 5.1. These five prototype modules had been tested in standalone mode between 1993 and 1995 [1][2]. Scintillator walls at the side and back of the calorimeter stack assisted in the identification of muons and shower leakage.

A major part of our study has been done with the source calibration data, so a description of the source drives is given below. During the September 96 test beam, two source drive

Figure 5.1: Barrel Module 0 test beam layout.

concepts were tested: the hydraulic drive and the pneumatic drive. As will be explained, the experience with the pneumatic system showed that this was not the most adequate system for ATLAS.

Besides the source calibration, data with muons, pions and electrons were also taken. The energy of the beam varied between 20 and 400 GeV. Different \(\eta\), \(\phi\) and z scans (z is the horizontal direction perpendicular to the beam line), 90 degrees scans (i.e. with particles impinging at 90 degrees to the tiles and steel plates) were taken with different particles and different energies. Data from the test beam have been analised and has shown good performance of the Barrel Module 0. For example, the fitted energy resolution for pions at \(\eta=\) -0.35 was \(\sigma/\mathrm{E}=\big{(}46.7\pm 1.1\big{)}\%\big{/}\sqrt{\mathrm{E}}+ \big{(}2.2\pm 1.2\big{)}\%\), which satisfies the ATLAS requirements [3].

#### The Source Drives

##### The hydraulic Drive

In the hydraulic concept the source calibration tubes are filled with a liquid which is set in motion with a pump. A capsule containing the source is introduced in the liquid; for capsule diameters slightly smaller than the tube aperture there is negligible flow past the capsule and its velocity is practically the same as that of the liquid column.

This concept is attractive because it is simple and the source velocity is adequate. On the other hand, a practical and safe design must be demonstrated to satisfy the following specific requirements:

* be safe against fluid leaks,
* in order not to compromise the measurement of the source-induced current the capsule velocity must be constant to within about 1%,
* the position of the capsule must be detected by a system independent of the hydraulic drive.

The liquid chosen for the 1996 tests was distilled water, and the performance of the system showed that the requirements could be met. The concern about leaks can be alleviated by using a "safe" liquid, such as Perfluorohexane (C\({}_{6}\)F\({}_{14}\)), which is non-flammable, chemically inert, non-corrosive, electrically insulating, non-toxic, and rapidly evaporates due to its high vapour pressure (about 0.2 atm at room temperature). This liquid was also tested in the summer of 1996. However, this liquid has a larger density than water, which implies more load on the pump and a larger risk of hydraulic shock4. Also due to the lower viscosity it is more difficult to maintain a stable driving force, and it is more difficult to get rid of bubbles of gas.

Footnote 4: When a closed pipe system is filled with uncompressable liquid that moves with some velocity, a certain amount of momentum/energy is stored in its volume. If one wants to stop the flow of the liquid with a valve, the force at the valve body, which is a result of liquid mass inertia, is in inversely proportional to the time of valve action. If a large mass of liquid is stopped at once, the pressure on the valve can be enormous, such effect is called “hydraulic shock” by analogy with a mechanical one (hammer).

The BM0 calorimeter tiles are traversed by 11 tubes (one per tile row) which are joined with bent tube sections to form a single circuit. The two ends of the circuit were connected to the liquid drive unit by 45 m long flexible tubes. The drive unit was located in the control room and consisted of a gear pump, pressure and temperature sensors, electromechanical valves and a reservoir. The system could be locally or remotely controlled. The source capsule was kept in a Pb garage on the scanning table. A remotely controlled mechanism inserted the source into the moving liquid column. At the end of its path through the calorimeter, the source came to rest against a mechanical stop; the direction of the liquid flow was inverted, and the source returned to its starting place.

An optical system based on infrared LED and sensors was built in order to detect the passage of the capsule at selected points of the liquid circuit. An emitter-sensor pair was installed on the connectors at the joints of the straight tube sections; the interruption of a pulse train signalled the passage of the capsule and allowed to measure its velocity through all straight sections.

More than 50 scans of Module 0 were performed with this system and produced data suitable for offline analysis.

**5.1.1.2 The Pneumatic Drive.**

In the pneumatic concept, compressed air was used to push the source capsule down the tubes. The capsule, restrained by a thin flexible line, was released at constant speed by an appropriate spooling mechanism. The force was provided by the aerodynamic drag across the capsule, which was again slightly smaller than the tube aperture. The velocity was intrinsically stable and repeatable, small leaks of the tube system were not a threat, and the position of the capsule was known by measuring the length of line spooled in or out as the capsule moved.

On the other hand, friction of the retaining line in the tubes (particularly in the bends) limited the useful path due to the maximum total bend allowed by friction. There was also the possibility of breaking the line and thereby losing control of the source. In order to keep the tension on the capsule, for BM0 it was chosen to break the path of the source within the Barrel into three paths of 3, 3 and 5. Each path terminated in a lead "source catcher", which also provided a safety feature if the restraining line breaks.

The pneumatic drive concept was also tested in the summer of 1996 by developing a prototype system for the BM0. A train of 8 spherical capsules, axially mounted on a piano wire of 0.2 mm diameter, provided the main drag force. The capsules were spaced by 15 mm long Teflon tubes. At one end of the train, a bicapsule containing the radioactive source was attached, and at the other end another dumbbell-shaped bi-capsule connected the capsule train to the nylon line. This bicapsule was made of two parts, which were screwed together when the source train was joined to the nylon line; a transverse pin prevented the assembly from coming loose.

The train of capsules was released and pulled back by a machine located on the calorimeter scanning table, which could be remotely or manually operated. When inserting the source into the calorimeter the nylon line unwounded from a storage reel onto the drive pulley where it was wound twice. The tension on the line release velocity was measured by a load cell attached to a second pulley through which the line was fed. The capsule train was normally kept in the machine, with the radioactive source in the centre of the lead garage. The revolving mechanism was pneumatically actuated. The train exited the machine pushed by the drag produced by air flow, and was pulled back at the end of its path by rewinding the nylon line onto the take-up reel.

Measurements of the calorimeter response with this system were made with excellent control of the position and velocity of the source. However, the loss of tension on the restraining nylon line as the source went through bent tube sections was seen to be greater than previously seen in static tests, so this drive was considered not viable for the ATLAS final design.

#### 5.1.2 Source path, fibres and fibre routing.

The path of the source calibration tubes is shown in figure 5.2. In BM0 the tubes passed through the outer radius hole of each tile giving as a result one source structure for each tile row in each cell.

The fibres were inserted manually with the following procedure. The fibres were cut to the correct length using a paper cutter and stored grouped in bundles. Each group was labelled with their respective length, number of fibres and cell label. With the module in the vertical position, and the girder at the bottom, the fibres where inserted into pockets formed by aluminised mylar glued to the tile covers and looped over the edges of the tiles. Fibres were inserted from the inner radius towards the girder to minimise mechanical stress on the aluminised end of the fibre. The insertion sequence started with fibres which read cells in sample 3 (i.e. tile rows 10 or 11) and which end just some millimetres after leaving the edge of the corresponding tile. Then, fibres which read sample 2 were inserted into the pockets of tiles in rows 4 to 9 and run on the outside surface of the pockets of sample 3. Lengths for these fibres were chosen to allow the definition of the cell structure in figure 3.5, and therefore they end a few millimetres after tiles in rows 8 or 7 and 5 or 4. Finally, fibres which read sample 1 were inserted in the appropriate pockets of tiles of rows 1 to 3 and run on the outside surface of the pockets of both samples 3 and 2. For each half period, 1.5 cm long plastic profiles were inserted at the bottom end of the steel grooves in between adjacent masters, to avoid fibre damage through contact with the sharp edges of the masters. At the end of the procedure, the fibres hung in the vertical position in groups defined by the sampling or sub-sampling to which they belong. To form the readout cells, the fibres were grouped in bundles and routed to the respective PMTs. The routing to the PMTs was done minimising the curvatures as described in [4].

Figure 5.2:

#### Characteristics of the source data

Due to the limitation in the data acquisition system and the on the switching in the 3-in-1 bus, during 1996 only 10 PMTs were read at the same time. The PMTs were the ones corresponding to the cell where the source was going through, and the two preceding and following cells. To choose which PMTs had to be read in each moment the speed of the source had to be taken into account. With this information a look up table (LUT) was constructed in order to be able to analyse the data later. As the source speed was not always well known, some times some structures were lost (this was solved in the 1997 source data taking, as will be explained later).

### 5.2 The Extended Barrel Module 0s

In 1997, two Extended Barrel Module 0s were constructed and tested in standalone mode. The test beam took place, as in the previous year, at the H8B area. One of the EBs was constructed in Argonne National Laboratory, USA, and the other at the Institut de Fisica d'Altes Energies, in Barcelona (and they will be called the ANL module and the BCN module from now on). The modules were also mounted in the movable table used for the Barrel Module 0 test beam. The test beam layout is shown in figure 5.3.

Figure 5.3 Extended Barrel Module 0s test beam layout.

The two EBs were mechanically identical, but some electronics and optics were different. For the electronics 15 channels of the BCN module were equipped with the new bi-gain 12-bit ADC readout. The optics is explained later in this chapter.

The beam tests of the two modules were done for a few days in August, and for three weeks in September, and as for the BM0 scans of pions, electrons and muons with different energies were taken. For the calibration runs, they were taken periodically from July 1997 until March 1998. Data taken with electrons, pions, etc have been analised and the good performance of the two EBs tested. Some preliminary results on the energy resolution with pions at \(\eta=\) -1.3 are for the ANL module \(\sigma/\mathrm{E}=\left(40.3\pm 1.2\right)\%/\sqrt{\mathrm{E}}+\left(2.5\pm 0.1 \right)\%\), and for the BCN module \(\sigma/\mathrm{E}=\left(47.2\pm 1.1\right)\%/\sqrt{\mathrm{E}}+\left(1.4\pm 0.8 \right)\%\)[5]. Which again, as was the case for the Barrel Module 0, agree with the ATLAS requirements.

#### The Source drive

An improved version of the hydraulic drive was used in 1997. For example, two garages were installed, which allowed to finish each run in a different garage, i.e. at a different side of the modules, and it was not necessary to take the source back to the initial position.

Also a new system of sensors was established, based on an inductive pick-up coil connected to a phase-locked-loop, which turned out to be much more stable than the infra-red ones. The sensor system monitored the source velocity during the complete path of the source. The filling and draining of the system was also improved. This procedure took on the order of 15 minutes, without large water losses or other problems.

#### Source path, fibres and fibre routing.

The source calibration tubes path for the 1997 test beam layout is shown in figure 5.4. It is important to notice that in the EB0s the path is composed of 12 tubes because the source goes through both holes of tile row 7. Furthermore, the source travels through the outer hole in tile rows 1 to 6 and through the inner holes in tile rows 8 to 11. The reason for this path is to keep all external connections as well as those between modules on the outer end of the barrel.

The fibres used were of the same type as those of BM0. The insertion of the fibres was done in a different way, however, allowing a test of the final procedure and design. As will be explained later, the tests revealed that further investigation is needed. Instead of inserting the fibres one by one, plastic profiles were used along the full groove next to the tile edges. Each profile contains the fibres reading a half period for the complete module in depth (i.e. a half period for the three samples). Once each profile was equipped with the three fibres (this is the number needed for the EB0s, four will be needed for the Barrel Modules), the insertion of the profiles in the grooves of the module is easier and quicker. As can be seen in figure 5.5, the profile cross section has a closed non-regular shape to allow an easy fibre insertion and routing inside the profile and to enhance the profile elasticity. The profile holds a WLS fibre against the edge of the tile, and fibres carrying light from previous layers are routed inside of the profiles, which should isolate them from subsequent tiles.

Figure 5.4:

Finally, both modules had a different fibre routing scheme, with different fibre lengths. The ANL module used a routing proposed by Shooltz et al [6]. The scheme was designed to optimise the uniformity of light yield within the cell and between cells. For the BCN module, the routing was the one proposed by the Lisbon group [7]. In this case, the aim is to obtain the minimum tension and curvatures in the fibres, which should allow to obtain the best efficiency in the fibre response.

#### Characteristics of the source data

The main difference with respect to the 1996 data was that this all the PMTs were read at each point. This produced a large amount of data, which was a useful tool that allowed observation of some anomalies in the system, as will be shown in chapter 6 and in appendix I.

## 6 Calibration and Light Yield Measurement of the Barrel Module 0

The first priority when looking at the 1996 source calibration data was to check that the calibration system could work as required after the changes introduced in the diameters of the calibration tubes and the new mechanical design, and before deciding to go further in the final ATLAS design. For this reason the stability and repeatability of the measurements needed to be checked and the algorithm to extract the calibration constants for the calorimeter tested. In addition to this, information on the light yield for the different radial layers of tiles inside a cell is provided by the source calibration scans. In fact, no absolute light yield information (i.e. number of photoelectrons in the PMT photocathode per GeV of energy deposited in the calorimeter) is obtained, but only relative values within the different tile rows in the module. The same kind of information can be extracted from the response of the calorimeter to muons impinging at 90 degrees with respect to the plane of the tiles. The results obtained from those two data sets were compared and interpreted in terms of a model based on a parameterisation of the fibre and tile response. A more detailed study of individual tile row responses indicated additional effects that needed further investigation.

### The Source Calibration Data

#### 6.1.1 The Source Calibration Systems in 1996

As has been described in chapter 5, two source drives were tested during the summer of 1996. In the hydraulic drive, a capsule containing an 8 mCi \({}^{137}\)Cs source is propelled by a hydraulic system across the hollow tubes that traverse the calorimeter. A typical spectrum observed by the slow current integrator is shown in figure 1. Peaks and valleys in the structure appear as the source passes through tiles and steel respectively. The current is sampled approximately every 3 mm. In these data, the peak-valley structure is damped due to a problem with the electronics, which was corrected in 1997. The time

Figure 1: Example of a typical structure in Barrel Module 0.

constant of the integrator was of about 100 ms instead of the 10 ms that would have been optimal.

In the pneumatic drive, compressed air was used to push the source capsule down the tubes. The capsule, restrained by a thin flexible line, is released at constant speed by an appropriate spooling mechanism. In these data, the peak-valley structure is more evident due to the lower speed of the pneumatic drive.

#### The Gain Setting procedure and calibration

The Barrel Module 0 (BM0) was only half equipped, i.e. 46 PMTs reading 23 cells in the positive \(\eta\) side of the module (as shown in figure 3.4). Each cell contained tiles of different sizes: 3 for the cells in sample 1, 6 for the cells in sample 2 and 2 for the cells in sample 3. The aim of the gain setting procedure is to adjust the gain of the PMTs reading the module, to assure that for the same amount of energy deposited in any cell, the response of the calorimeter is the same within a dispersion better than 2%.

The first step is to set all the PMTs at a nominal gain of \(10^{5}\) within a nominal stated precision of \(\pm\)5%. The corresponding high voltage values were determined by laboratory bench tests at Clermont-Ferrand, France. Then a source run is taken, and the response of each cell as viewed by each PMT is calculated as the normalised integral of the structure obtained while the source goes through the second tile row in that cell (the way this normalised integral is calculated is explained in 6.1.3). The gains of the PMTs are adjusted, using their known relation to the high voltage applied, and the process is repeated, typically for 2 or 3 iterations, until a dispersion better than 2% is achieved. Information from a single tile row is used for simplicity. Another possible choice would be the average of the normalised integrals for all the tile rows in that cell. As will be shown in the following pages, if the longitudinal profile (see section 6.4.1) of the light yield of the module is well understood the two procedures should be equivalent.

#### The Source Data

Most of the results presented in this chapter were obtained with data from several runs of source calibration taken with the hydraulic drive after the gain setting was done. Some cross-checks were made with data from the pneumatic system. The precision of an individual measurement of a calorimeter cell response was 0.7% as extracted from repeatability measurement. As will be shown in section 6.1.4, for what concerns the light yield study all runs gave similar results. The source data presented from section 6.1.5 onward belong mostly to run number 1048 taken on September 6th 1996.

The analysis of the data proceeded as follows:

* The integral of the current structure measured in a cell is proportional to the amount of energy deposited in the calorimeter, the light yield of that particular cell and the quantum efficiency and gain of the PMT. In order to compare cells of different widths, the integral of the response curve was divided by the cell width measured in number of samplings of the current. Note that this normalisation also eliminates the effect of any variation of source velocity from run to run.
* In order to extract the response of a particular tile row the fraction of energy deposited in each tile row had to be taken into account. The source traversed a row of tiles in a cell through a hole situated at 15 mm from the edge, a distance which is of the same order as the range of \({}^{137}\)Cs photons in the calorimeter structure, therefore about 77% of the energy was deposited in the corresponding row, 22% in the closest neighbour and about 1% in the row situated on the opposite side [1]. These fractions were estimated by MC simulation and are in agreement with source data obtained with the TILECAL prototype modules. In the hydraulic drive the source went through the lower hole of tiles, i.e. the one on the inner radius, while the pneumatic system used the other hole.
* The particular case of the two rows of tiles adjacent to the border between the two sub-cells of sample 2 (see figure 2.4) also had to be considered. An example of a structure obtained in one of the sub-cells is shown in figure 6.2. This case is a useful example, that shows the source travelling along tile row 7. The shoulder on the left corresponds to 22% of light that got deposited in row 6 of cell BC4 when the source traversed tile row 7 in cell BC3. Then, all light was collected in cell BC4, and this is the large bump. Finally, the right shoulder is when only 77% of light was deposited in cell BC4, the 22% being collected in tile row 6 of cell BC5. This was taken into account when unfolding the light budget from the current measured in cells of tile row 6 or 7.

A few cells have been discarded from the analysis. PMTs 9, 15 and 16 presented readout problems and all the PMTs reading the cells on the high \(\eta\) side were partially equipped with new profiles and did not present uniform response. The unfolded individual tile row responses for all PMTs are given in tables 1, 2 and 3. These values somewhat reflect the accuracy of the gain setting procedure. PMTs 1 and 2 were not well intercalibrated due to a procedure error. Beyond this, one should not be surprised to see the responses varying more than the 2% required in the calibration. The values of the normalised integrals for tile row 2, 5 and 11 (10 for the pneumatic system) were used for the gain setting and these values indeed had a dispersion within the 2% limit. However, these values not only contain response information from these tile rows, but also from the appropriately adjacent tile row (depending on which hole was traversed by the source). The unfolding disentangles the different tile row contributions and the disuniformites in light yield between tile rows propagate.

### 6.1.4 Stability and Repeatability of the Source Data

#### 6.1.4.1 Repeatability

The response of a PMT to a \({}^{137}\)Cs source scan can be summarised in one number, the average current A. For each PMT, n numbers A\({}_{\rm a}\) are measured, corresponding to the n rows of tiles which constitute the calorimeter cell read by that PMT. These numbers typically differ by a few percent because of the different light yields from different tile-fibre combinations. The repeatability of the source measurement system can be estimated by taking two average responses for different tile rows read by the same PMT, A\({}_{\rm k}\) and A\({}_{\rm m}\), and two source scans taken at different times t\({}_{\rm i}\) and t\({}_{\rm z}\), and forming the double ratio:

\[{\rm R}=\frac{{\rm A}_{\rm k}\left({\rm t}_{\rm i}\right)/{\rm A}_{\rm i}\left( {\rm t}_{\rm z}\right)}{{\rm A}_{\rm m}\left({\rm t}_{\rm i}\right)/{\rm A}_{\rm m }\left({\rm t}_{\rm z}\right)}\]

in which the differences in source response, due to PMT gain drift from t\({}_{\rm i}\) to t\({}_{\rm z}\) and to tile-fibre yields, will cancel. The rms of the distribution of the double ratios will be \(\sqrt[]{4}\) times the error of the individual measurements. Two such distributions obtained from scans made on BM0 in September 1996 are given in figure 6.3. From these distributions the uncertainty on cell scans is estimated to be about 0.7%.

Figure 6.3 Two distributions of double ratios defined as in text from Module 0 source measurements.

#### 6.1.4.2 Stability

During BM0 test beam runs, source scans were taken at one or 2 days intervals. In figure 6.4 the results of source scans of Module 0 (taken with the hydraulic system) over the September 1996 run are given. The number of the PMTs are on the axis numbered from 0 to 48, the runs are on the second horizontal axis (labelled from 1 to 12, in the order they were taken), and the normalised responses are on the vertical axis. This gives a qualitative picture of the stability of the calorimeter response.

To obtain a more quantitative assessment, the rms variation of the response for the BM0 PMTs was calculated, normalising the values A\({}_{\mathrm{n}}\) for each of the n PMTs to the first measurement. The distribution is given in figure 6.5. The typical variation of the response is 0.4% to 1.3%, which is about what is obtained for the intrinsic error of the measurement and shows that the response of the calorimeter -including drift of the PMTs- is stable to this level.

### 6.2 Data taken with Muons at 90 degrees

Information complementary to the source calibration data is provided by data where test beam muons impinge at 90 degrees to the tile plane in the centre of the tiles. The results presented in this chapter come from runs from 11859 to 11869 (one run per tile, taken on September 16th, 1996). The aim of this study was to check the consistency between the source and muons results.

The BM0 PMTs were read out by fast pulse electronics that sampled the signal every 25 ns. The data were analysed with the Tilemon software [2]. Two methods to reconstruct the signal from the set of digital samples have been compared. The first was the full integral method that consists in summing up the set of 40 samples taken in each cell. The second uses a filter function algorithm that calculates the sum of 5 samples around a maximum applying appropriate weights. The maximum was fixed to sample 14. The muon signal obtained with the filter method presents a smaller width to peak ratio than the one with the integral method. The filter method has been used in the comparison with the source data. As in the case of the source, the muon signal is normalised to the relevant width of the cell; in this case the number of scintillator tiles forming each row.

Figure 6.5 Variation of the response of the BM0 PMTs during the Sept. 1996 run: rms variation for all PMTs.

The muons results were obtained by T. Davidek [3], applying the parameterisation for the muon response proposed by T. Davidek and R. Leitner [4].

The repeatability of the fit to the muon signal can be inferred from the study of the stability of the ratio of muon signals for two different tiles in a cell in the two sets of available runs. The "ratio-of-ratios" method [5] was used; the results are given in figure 6.6. The distribution of the "ratio-of-ratios" has an rms of 2.9%; indicating that the muon response is repeatable within 1.5%.

The results of the fit to the muon spectra can be found in tables 4, 5 and 6. Data from PMT 39 were not used because of a high pedestal. The tables of results are presented for the set of PMTs common to the muon and source data samples.

### The correlation between Source and Muon data

As has been mentioned, data from high energy muons impinging at 90 degrees provide an alternative technique to intercalibrate the calorimeter cells. The correlation between the results obtained for individual cells from the source and muon data was checked. Figures 6.7 and 6.8 show a clear correlation, with an rms of 6.6%. Note the non-zero intercept of the correlation line, which indicates some uncontrolled systematic effect (for example, a problem in the pedestal subtraction could produce such an effect).

### The Light Yield of Barrel Module 0 as measured with Source and Muon data

At this point data from muons and source can be compared to a model, developed by the Lisbon group [6]. Data on fibre response is parameterised by a sum of two exponentials:

\[\mathrm{f}(x,L)=\mathrm{I}_{0}^{S}e^{\frac{x}{\lambda_{s}}}+\mathrm{I}_{0}^{ L}e^{\frac{x}{\lambda_{L}}}+\mathrm{R}\left(\mathrm{I}_{0}^{S}e^{\frac{2L-x}{ \lambda_{s}}}+\mathrm{I}_{0}^{L}e^{\frac{2L-x}{\lambda_{L}}}\right)\]

where \(\lambda_{L}=\)250 cm and \(\lambda_{S}=\)25 cm are the long and short attenuation lengths; R=0.75 is the reflection coefficient of the aluminised end of the fibres; \(\mathrm{I}_{0}^{S}=\)3.1 and \(\mathrm{I}_{0}^{L}=\)4.8 are the short and long light yields for the aluminised fibres (in arbitrary units); L is the fibre length; and x is thedistance along the fibre length between the position of the hole illuminated by the source and the PMT.

On the other hand, the response of tiles is parameterised as a function of the tile size [7].

\[\mathrm{t(\hat{f})=K_{1}+K_{2}\,\frac{w(\hat{f})}{a(\hat{f})}}\]

where K\({}_{1}\)=0.49 and K\({}_{2}\)=105.2 (in arbitrary units); w and a are the width in the radial direction and the area of the tile. The above formula reflects that the response of a tile read at its edge is inversely proportional to the distance from that edge to the point where the energy has been deposited.

#### The average response over tile rows.

For each tile row the average of the different cell responses was calculated. The model predicts a dispersion for each tile row average, which arises from the different fibre lengths in each cell. The same subsample of cells was used for source, muons and the model. The results are shown in figures 6.9 and 6.10 in the form of what is called the longitudinal profile, i.e. the average tile row response is plotted vs tile number, and the error bars of each point correspond to the dispersion within the corresponding tile row. The information in the two figures can be summarised as follows:

* The same basic features of the profile are seen with source and with muons (see figure 6.9), which are seen to be in good agreement.
* The trend of the longitudinal profile is, to a first approximation, explained by the model (see figure 6.10). The main disagreement between the model and data is found for tiles 6, 7 and 8.
* The rms of the distribution of source responses for all PMTs and all tile rows is of 7.6%, but the tails are important and far from the mean value. A more detailed study is needed to see if this is too much in terms of what is required for the contribution to the constant term in the resolution of the calorimeter.

Figure 6.10: Average response per tile row comparing source data to the light yield model. The response is normalised to the first tile in each sample.

Figure 6.9: Average response per tile row comparing source and muon data. The response is normalised to the first tile in each sample.

In order to get more insight to the problem we studied, with the help of the model, the different contributions coming from tiles and fibres. Figure 6.11 shows separately the contribution to the non-uniformity of response from fibres and tiles in a Barrel Module 0 configuration. The two effects compensate in first approximation except for the case of tiles 7, 8 and 9 where fibres appear to be too short. For the compensation to work effectively 10 cm should be added to the fibre lengths of tiles 7, 8 and 9. Figure 6.12 shows the expected longitudinal profile for BM0 in that case. A better uniformity is obtained.

Hence, two conclusions can be reached:

1. The disuniformity between the two subsamples of sample 2 can be controlled by a fine adjustment of the fibre lengths.
2. There is a remaining disuniformity: the one of tile 3 with respect to tiles 1 and 2 (or tile 6 with respect to tiles 4 and 5, etc.). This is a consequence of the fact that two different tiles are read by the same fibre, and the remaining disuniformity is governed mostly by the difference in the light yield in the two tiles.

In conclusion, the features are explained globally by the model, but some discrepancies appear, such as the relative response of tile 7 and 8, which is almost equal for the model but not for the data.

#### The individual cell response.

The individual cell response, rather than average response for a tile row, was investigated next looking for an explanation to the tile 7 and 8 behaviour presented in the previous section.

Fibre length dependence

In BM0, the different cells of a sample have different fibre lengths. The ratio of the response of tile7/tile4 and tile8/tile5 should depend only on the difference in fibre lengths. That difference can vary from 40 to 70 cm. Following the model, the dependence of the ratio 7/4 and 8/5 on that difference should be to a first approximation linear as shown in figure 6.13 and with a maximum expected difference of about 9%. Also, the ratios 7/4 and 8/5 should be the same for the same fibre length difference.

But when the same distribution is done for source and muons, a large dispersion appears (figures 6.14 and 6.15). We can see that the behaviour of PMTs in tile 7 and 4 (open dots) is compatible with what the model predicts (more clearly with muon data than with source data). However the 8/5 response ratio is higher than predicted by the model, has a large dispersion (around 20% or more) and show no correlation with the difference in fibre lengths. The signal of tile 8 is higher than expected: this effect is seen in both source and muons (the same discrepancy as already observed in the average longitudinal profile plot of figure 6.9). This unpredicted dispersion must be due to some effect, in the fibres, the tiles or the routing that is not considered in the model but clearly it can not be explained by the difference in fibre lengths.

Figure 6.13: Ratio of light yields as predicted by the model.

The correlation between the source and muon response for these ratios of signals was checked and is again clearly seen and good to 6% (see figure 6.16).

Figure 6.16: Check of muons vs source data correlation for the ratios tile7/tile4 (open squares).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:82]

The two right hand plots show the responses from tiles that belong to the same readout cell but are not equalised by the gain setting process. The left-right differences are larger than could be expected. The top right plot shows a left-right difference of about 6%; however the two structures are very similar in form. This is not so for the bottom right response curves; where the dips and bumps do not coincide. Instead, it appears that a dip in one tile is coincident with a bump on the other. In this case, the anomaly most likely is associated to some fault in one or more fibres.

In summary, the left-right differences observed are larger than expected and not understood. However, they are not systematic and are not an explanation for the unpredicted behaviour of tile rows 7 and 8.

Tile-fibre fluctuations

A further conclusion from figure 6.18 is that individual tile or fibre effects, which are less than 10%, are not large enough to account for the fluctuations of the ratios shown at the beginning of this section, which are up to 30%. This was more clearly seen in the study of individual fibre-to-fibre fluctuations and tile-to-fibre coupling inside a tile row of a cell [8]. The current spectrum in a cell is fitted by the sum of the individual tile response. A symmetric

Figure 6.18: Examples of left-right differences.

exponential form has been chosen to represent the variation of individual (tile + fibre) signal vs the distance (positive or negative) of the source from the axis of the tile. An example of the fit to pneumatic source data can be seen in figure 6.19. The attenuation length of this exponential, and the distance tile to tile, in source coordinate units, are kept the same within a cell. These two parameters come out in good agreement with the values expected from the module geometry and the attenuation lengths of \({}^{137}\)Cs gammas in iron. The maximal signal is determined tile by tile by the fit. The responses of approximately 400 tiles are shown in figure 6.20. The values are given relative to the average response for each source current spectrum, i.e. for each tile row in a cell, to exclude contributions from residual PMT miscalibrations or effects due to different fibre lengths. The sigma of the responses is 5%, with a few entries far away in the tail, but indicating that altogether individual fibre effects cannot explain the dispersion seen in figure 6.16.

Bundle and sub-bundle effects

To further investigate the effect, the data sample used in the left-right dependence study was separated by pairing tiles connected to the same fibres (figure 6.21) or tiles connected to different fibres (figure 6.22). In one case a strong correlation is observed while in the other case it is not. This is yet another indication than the effect seems to be connected to the fibres themselves and not to the tile-fibre connections.

The observations above indicate that the large dispersion in individual cell responses within a tile row seems to originate at the level of fibre bundles or subbundles. Further investigation would require correlating the responses to the way the bundling was done, for example studying the dependence on the particular fibre curvatures for each subbundle. Unfortunately, data on these curvatures was not available for the Barrel Module 0.

### 6.5 Conclusions

The results presented in this chapter have shown that there is good understanding of the light yield of the module. The results predicted by the model are in a good agreement with the ones obtained with source data, and data from muons impinging at 90 degrees have been used to check the conclusions.

However, some unpredicted, and in fact not fully understood, dispersions have shown up in the reponses of tiles in rows 7 and 8. These have been observed with source and muon data but not enough information is available to fully understand the problem.

There is another effect, which is that the responses of muons within a tile row always present larger dispersions than for the source data. In the muons-source correlation study a hint that maybe there is a problem of pedestal subtraction or noise in the muon analysis has appeared. This effect needs further investigation.

Finally, it should be noted that the aim of the source calibration is to maintain the PMTs intercalibrated within 2%. This is to keep response variations between cells below 10%, provided that the length of fibres has been correctly chosen to keep the intrinsic differences in response within a cell below 5%. This in turn will assure that the contribution to the constant term of the resolution is not larger than desired. The source calibration system has been shown to perform as required. The intercalibration was done at the required level and was kept during the whole test beam period. The precision of the source measurements has allowed the use of these data for light yield studies. The effect observed in tiles 7, 8 and 9 surpasses the total allowed dispersion, but this can be solved adding a few centimetres to the appropriate fibres. However, a more detailed study of the contributions of the different disuniformities to the constant term is needed.

## 7 Calibration and Light Yield Measurement of the Extended Barrel Module 0s

As was seen in the previous chapter, the source calibration data gives useful information on the light yield for the different radial layers of tiles inside a cell. In this chapter, the study done for the Barrel Module 0 will be repeated, but with somewhat different aims. As has been explained in chapter 5, two mechanically identical Extended Barrel Module 0s (EB0s) were tested in 1997. The light yield for the two modules and a characterisation of them will be obtained with the source data. The response to muons impinging at 90 degrees with respect to the plane of the tiles will be compared to that obtained with the Cs source data.

### 7.1 The Source Calibration Data

The work plan for the 1997 EB0s included long-term monitoring of the calorimeter for the first time. This monitoring was originally scheduled for a few months, but as will be explained later was extended until end of March 1998, which was the maximum allowed without compromising the preparation of the 1998 test beam.

#### The Source Calibration System in 1997

The drive used during the monitoring period started in the summer of 1997 was an improvement of the hydraulic drive tested in the previous test beam (see chapter 5). A typical structure in a cell of one of the EB0s is shown in figure 7.1. The peaks and valleys in the structure are more pronounced than with the BM0 acquisition (because the time constant of the integrator was set to 10 ms instead of 100 ms, see section 4.2.3 for more details).

Figure 7.1: Example of a typical source calibration structure in an Extended Barrel

#### The Gain Setting procedure and calibration

The procedure for the gain setting during the 1997 test beam was the same than the one for the Barrel Module 0. After the first step, that was to set all the PMTs at the nominal high voltages, i.e. to a nominal gain of \(10^{5}\), some differences between the two EBs appeared. The ANL module produced less light than the BCN module. This could be explained by the fact that both modules have different fibre routing. The difference that was seen was of 20%. A precise prediction for this difference is not available, as it is very difficult to give a quantitative number of the effect of the curvatures and stresses in the fibres. More about this difference is explained in section 7.4.1.

A choice had to be made between moving the two modules towards a common mean or leaving one as it was and moving the other. As the nominal gain of \(10^{5}\) is the one expected to be used in the ATLAS design, it was decided to move just one module. All the PMTs in the ANL module were set to a higher voltage in order to have the same mean as the ones of the BCN module. After that, it took four iterations to arrive at the final setting for the HVs of the different PMTs, obtaining a dispersion of the responses better than 2%.

Figure 7.2: Distribution of the normalised integrals for the two modules after the first runs at he nominal HVs.

#### The Source Data

Most of the results presented in this chapter were obtained with source calibration data taken with the hydraulic drive after the gain setting was done. A major part of the results come from runs 10435 and 10435, and 10794 and 10795 (two for each module) taken in July and October of 1997.

Conceptually the analysis of the data was the same as for the test beam in 1996. The integral of the curve, however, was only calculated between the two points that fix the full width at half maximum (fwhm). The fact of using this algorithm introduced some differences amongst the cells of different sizes, and although these differences were not taken into account for the gain setting, they have been taken into account when comparing with other results or with the Lisbon Model.

In 1997 a specific and tedious problem was present when analysing the data. The plastic profiles containing the fibres where found to be somewhat transparent, and this caused part of the light that should have been read by one fibre to be lost or to be read by another fibre. The final effect seen in the data was an optical cross-talk from one sample to the other. A more detailed explanation of the cross-talk and how it was corrected can be found in appendix I. The correction due to the range of the photons of the calorimeter also needed to be applied.

ITC cells have been discarded from the analysis. The unfolded individual tile row responses for the PMTs are given in tables 1, 2 and 3.

#### 7.1.4 Stability and repeatability.

The plan for the 1997 test beam was to do a monitoring of the two EB0s using the source calibration system. However, after just a few days of data taking a drop in response with time was found. A description of the problem with a summary of what has been learnt is presented in appendix II. For what concerns most of this study, this drop does not affect the conclusions. We are looking for the shape of the longitudinal profile, the dispersions within a tile row and information that can help to understand the disuniformities of light yield in TILECAL, and what can be done to reduce them if possible. As explained in the appendix, the shape of the light yield of the two modules does not change due to the drop in response, so they can be treated as separated problems.

The repeatability of the measurements is of great importance. A set of 15 runs per module was taken on 8 October 1997, exactly in the same conditions (within the precision of the system). Following what was done for the BM0 (see section 6.1.4.1), we use the double ratio as the way to measure the repeatability, the distribution found is the one shown in figure 7.3 (for the two modules). Knowing that the rms of the distribution is \(\sqrt{4}\) times the error of the

individual measurements, we have that the error on cell scans is about 0.2% for the two modules. This is better than the repeatability obtained for the Barrel Module 0. One of the improvements with respect to 1996 data was that the pedestals were more stable.

The plots in figure 7.3 were obtained using the first two runs of the set of stability runs taken, but similar results are obtained using other runs.5

Footnote 5: The 38 entries of the histograms correspond to the 24 PMTs reading samples 1 to 3 (ITC cells were not used). There are 10 PMTs reading sample 1, 10 PMTs reading sample 2 and 4 PMTs reading sample 3. In sample one there are only tiles of three different sizes and only one ratio can be used. For samples 2 and 3 two ratios can be formed per PMT, i.e. \(10+10x2+4x2=38\).

### The Data taken with Muons at 90 degrees

Two sets of runs of muons impinging plane in the centre of the tiles at 90 degrees to the tile were taken in 1997. These data, as was seen in the previous chapter, give complementary information to that coming from the source data, and provide a way to check the shape of the longitudinal profile of the light yield that can help the understanding of some of the unpredicted behaviour.

The results for the muons of the EBs were provided by Sergei Burdin, and have been cross-checked with the ones provided by Stanislav Nemecek and some by Thomas Davidek. The response for each PMT and each tile row was obtained with a gaussian fit to the energy response peak in the interval \(\pm 2\sigma\). The results obtained by Nemecek, who used a truncated mean to obtain the muon responses, showed a dependency on the cell size. The ones obtained with the gaussian fit may still have a slight dependence, but it should be small and they are good to be compared with source data.

The results of the fit to the muon spectra can be found in tables 4, 5 and 6. ITC cells were not used in this study.

### 7.3 The Correlation between Source and Muon data

The correlation between muons impinging at 90 degrees and source calibration data was checked. Figure 7.4 shows the muon-source correlation for the individual responses. Only the ANL module has the correlation line fitted. For the BCN module (plotted in figure 7.5) it is clear that the correlation is much worse. The reason for that is related with a noise problem affecting the pedestal subtraction of the muon signal, not yet solved, that will be briefly discussed in section 7.4.2.

The rms of the correlation is 6.5 % (see figure 7.6), at the same level of the one found for the Barrel Module 0. For the ANL module the intercept of the correlation line is zero within the errors. However, for the BCN module there is again a non-zero intercept as was first seen in the muon-source correlation for BM0; and larger than the one observed in 1996 data. Probably this is also related to the noise problem.

### The light Yield of Extended Barrel Module 0s s measured with Source and Muon data

In this section a comparison of the absolute light yield obtained with the source data with respect to the one obtained with muons at 90 degrees data and the one coming from the parameterisation of the model is done. First a study is made of the calibration runs before the gain setting was done, showing the power of the source calibration system that can give us a quick hint of disuniformities or anomalies in the light yield of a module. Afterwards, the average response per tile row is discussed and, as done in chapter 6 for BM0, the individual PMT response is used for a deeper understanding.

Light yield of the 1997 Extended Barrels Module 0 from Cs data with nominal PMT settings (before the gain setting)

One of the first steps in the gain setting of the Tile Calorimeter modules is to take Cs calibration data with the PMTs set to high voltage values corresponding to a nominal gain of \(10^{5}\) within a stated precision of \(\pm\) 5%. These values are determined by lab bench tests at several institutions. These nominal gain data together with tables of PMT gain variation with HV are then used to equalize the Cs responses of all cells in the module. The nominal gain data can also provide useful information on the absolute light yield of the Tile Calorimeter, albeit only to the level of precision to which the nominal PMT gains are known. For example, in the 1997 Extended Barrel Module 0s, the nominal gain data should immediately indicate any differences in light yield of the two modules due to differences in fiber routing. In this note we present an analysis of the 1997 EB nominal gain data.

##### 7.4.1.1 Data analysis

The data analyzed were run 10357 for the ANL module and run 10360 for the BCN module. These were the first runs at the nominal HVs and with drawer cooling on. The response for each tile row in a cell is calculated as the normalised integral of the corresponding Cs structure [1]. Two corrections were applied to the data: one due to the range of photons in the calorimeter structure, and the other to correct for cross-talk effects due to the transparency of the profiles [2]. A weighted average over all PMT signals for a given tile row is calculated, using the number of tiles per cell as the weight. The resulting light yield as a function of tile row is plotted in figure 7.7.

The data clearly show a higher light yield in the BCN module as compared to the ANL module, with a difference of about 20% in the two innermost sampling layers (corresponding to tile rows 1-3 and 4-7) and 30% in the outermost layer (tile rows 8-11). For tile rows 1-7, a difference can be expected, as the fibre routing for the ANL module has longer fibre lengths for these cells, with correspondingly larger light attenuation. The 30% difference for tile rows 8-11 is a surprise, however, as the fibre length is the same for these cells in both modules. This is well beyond the expected uncertainties of the measurements, which are those corresponding to the weighted average over 10, 10 and 4 PMTs, respectively for each sampling, which are nominally set to within 5%.

##### 7.4.1.2 Predictions for the light yield from the Lisbon model.

The Lisbon model [3] can be used to predict the differences in light yield between the two modules due to the different fibre routing. The input parameters to the model have been the fibre characteristics used for the 1996 analysis of the Barrel 0 module, the tile characteristics measured for the Extended Barrel Module 0s tiles [4], and the fibre lengths of the prototypes. The prediction of the model can be seen in figure 7.8, showing the expected difference of approximately 20% in the innermost layers and equal light yield for the outermost layer of both modules.

Figure 7.8: Longitudinal Profile predicted by the model for the nominal gain runs.

Figure 7.7: Longitudinal Profile for the runs at the nominal gains.

#### 7.4.1.3 Comparison of the Lisbon model with the Extended Barrel prototype data

In order to compare the prediction with the data, and arbitrary normalisation has to be introduced. Clearly, no choice of tile row for normalisation will make data and model agree. Tile row 9, which is the tile row used for the gain setting of the outermost layer, is chosen for the normalisation in figure 7.9 (where closed dots are for the Cs data and opened dots for the model). Tile rows 8, 10 and 11 agree quite well with the model, something reported in the analysis of the longitudinal light yield profile. Large discrepancies with respect to the model are seen in the other samples, especially in the BCN module.

Previously, the Lisbon model has only been used to compare the longitudinal light yield profiles, where a layer by layer normalisation is used which would hide the discrepancies described above. In order to check the ability of the model to predict the absolute light yield layer by layer, the analysis described above has been repeated using the nominal gain data for the 1996 Barrel Module 0. In this case, the normalisation is done with tile row 11, as this was used for the gain setting of the outermost layer. As can be seen in figure 7.10, for the Barrel Module 0 the model is in agreement with the data at the level of 10%, lending credibility to the analysis methodology.

Figure 7.9: Comparison between source data and model for the two EBs.

#### 7.4.1.4 Estimation of uncertainties

The design of the Tile Calorimeter is such that the characteristics of tiles and fibres are quite uniform over any given tile row. Under these ideal conditions, the dispersion in the response of different channels of the same tile row would be entirely due to dispersion in the gain of the PMTs and downstream electronics (Cs calibration integrators and ADC in this case). The Cs calibration electronics are checked independently and known to about 1%. Therefore, the observed dispersion of the response over a tile row is an estimator of the dispersion of nominal gains of the PMTs.

The standard deviations of the measurements over a tile row have values between 10 and 20%, higher than expected if the only source of variation is the 5% spread in the nominal setting of the PMTs. A check of the 1996 Barrel Module0 measurements yields similar results. Therefore, as additional effects seem to be contributing to the spread in light yield, the analysis has used the dispersion within a tile row as the estimator of the error. This may be overly pessimistic but assures that the errors are not underestimated. Table 1 shows the difference in absolute light yield between the BCN and ANL modules, tile row by tile row.

\[<\!\!\!\mathrm{T}_{i}\!\!>_{\mathrm{BCN}}.<\!\!\!\mathrm{T}_{i}\! >_{\mathrm{ANL}} = 588.51\pm 155.58\] \[<\!\!\!\mathrm{T}_{i}\!\!>_{\mathrm{BCN}}.<\!\!\!\mathrm{T}_{i} \!\!>_{\mathrm{ANL}} = 478.02\pm 155.85\] \[<\!\!\!\mathrm{T}_{i}\!\!>_{\mathrm{BCN}}.<\!\!\!\mathrm{T}_{i} \!\!>_{\mathrm{ANL}} = 330.01\pm 147.09\] \[<\!\!\!\mathrm{T}_{i}\!\!>_{\mathrm{BCN}}.<\!\!\!\mathrm{T}_{i} \!\!>_{\mathrm{ANL}} = 682.69\pm 217.92\] \[<\!\!\!\mathrm{T}_{i}\!\!>_{\mathrm{BCN}}.<\!\!\!\mathrm{T}_{i} \!\!>_{\mathrm{ANL}} = 634.93\pm 211.12\] \[<\!\!\!\mathrm{T}_{i}\!\!>_{\mathrm{BCN}}.<\!\!\!\mathrm{T}_{i} \!\!>_{\mathrm{ANL}} = 738.83\pm 210.17\]

Figure 7.10 Comparison between source data and model for the Barrel Module 0.

#### 7.4.1.5 Possible systematic effects

The following possible sources of systematic effects have been considered:

* Sorting of the PMTs by gain during installation: The PMTs have been assigned to cells randomly [5].
* Fibre bending effects: The model only takes into account fibre lengths, so additional effects due to the different fibre bending of the two routing schemes used could be unaccounted for. However, there is no way to add bending effects and simultaneously explain the differences within a module and between the two modules [6].
* Reduced light yield due to the cut profiles in tile rows 1 and 2 (see section I.4 for a detailed explanation): The drop in light yield in going from tile row 3 to rows 1 and 2 could be due to optical differences as the end of the profiles has been sliced for mechanical installation reasons. A quantitative measurement is needed to verify this hypothesis.

#### 7.4.1.6 Comparison with light yield results from electrons at 90 degrees

The photoelectron (pe) yield for both modules has been estimated using test beam data [7]. The measured number of pe/Gev using electrons at 90 degrees also seems to be anomalous. The comparison of these results with the nominal gain runs can be seen in figure 7.11 where the ratio between the two EBs for three tiles is plotted. The results for Cs are the ratios of the averages for the given tile row, as plotted in figure 7. The results for the electrons are shown in table 7. The Cs and the electrons results, both show a large difference in the response of sample three between the BCN and ANL modules.

Table 1:

#### 7.4.1.7 Conclusions

Anomalies in the absolute light yield of the Tile Calorimeter Extended Barrel module 0s are present, as observed from Cs calibration runs with the PMTs set to nominal gains of \(10^{5}\). Two discrepancies have been found. First, the unexpected difference between the two modules in the light yield of the outermost layer, expected to be identical as the fiber lengths are the same. Second, the discrepancies between the model predictions and the actual response in the tile row by tile row behaviour of the light yield. This effect is more pronounced in the BCN module, where an anomaly of almost a factor of two seems to be present. The experimental setup cannot distinguish if the innermost layers have anomalously low light yield or the outermost ones have anomalously high yield. This analysis has also been performed for the 1996 Barrel Module 0 where much better agreement with the model is found.

The present measurement critically depends on the accuracy with which the absolute gains of the PMTs have been set. An upper limit on the gain spread of 10 to 20%, depending

on tile row, is obtained from the data itself, which may account for additional optical effects above the nominally quoted accuracy of the PMT gain of 5%. Using this upper limit, the significance of the discrepancies is always larger than two standard deviations. The results presented here agree to a large extent with the 30% differences previously reported in the photoelectron yield of sample 3 between the two modules, which most probably come from the difference in the routing.

#### The response average over tile rows

As have been explained in chapter 4, control is needed over the longitudinal profile response, because it affects directly the constant term of the resolution of the hadronic calorimeter. It is important to measure the profile in the prototypes and to understand if it needs improvements.

As done in chapter 6, the source results will be compared with the model and with muons at 90 degrees. No new measurement was done for the fibre response and the same parameters than for the 1996 fibres were used. They are expected to be similar since the fibres were of the same type, and for example a variation 100 cm in the attenuation length only produces a difference of 10% in the fibre response (calculated for fibres reading tile row 8 in the barrel). For the tiles, the parameters were extracted from measurements on the newly produced tiles [8].

The average of the responses for all cells was calculated for the two EBs for the source and muon. The comparison of the longitudinal profile as extracted with source data for the two extended barrels is shown in figure 7.12. The agreement between the two EBs is quite good. The only tile row that differs in more than 5% is tile row 3. As explained in appendix I, the profiles were cut below this point and maybe this is affecting the two EBs in a different way. Unfortunately no tests are available that can confirm this hypothesis.

Figure 7.12: Comparison of the longitudinal profile between the two EBs as extracted from source data

The normalisation for each module is the average of all the responses for each PMT and each tile row, instead of the average of the first tile row in each sample used in BM0.

The comparison between the profile obtained with the source data and the one predicted by the model shows a few discrepancies (see figure 7.13). In general, the shape of the profile is quite similar with the exception of tile rows 3 and 7. These two tile rows happen to be the only ones that have a cross-talk correction (see appendix I for more details). It is possible that not completely understood effects are hidden under this discrepancy.

The last comparison done was the one between source and muons at 90 degrees data. Figure 7.14 shows the results. As can be seen, the dispersions for the muons are always greater than the ones for the source. However, there is still another important effect to be noticed. Clearly, the dispersion for muons is larger in the BCN module than in the ANL one. In principle this should not be the case, since the BCN module was equipped half with the same electronics than the ANL module, and the other half with the new bi-gain 3-in-1 cards, that should have less noise.

Figure 7.13: Comparison of the longitudinal profile between the source results and the prediction of the model for the two extended barrels.

The problem was tracked down to electronic noise in the BCN module. For example, comparing compressor channels in the BCN module with compressor channels in the ANL module, 20% more noise was found in the BCN ones. Even the bi-gain channels in the BCN module had more noise than the compressors in the ANL module. There were no differences in the compressor channel electronics for the two modules but some coherent noise has been found (this was checked by Kelby Anderson and Bob Stanek). Unfortunately this problem could not be solved during the test beam period.

#### The individual cell response

As was done for the Barrel Module 0, the following step was to look deeper in the data, going to the individual cell response. The aim of this approach is to understand better the data and to look for some explanations to the discrepancies observed in the comparison between source and muons, and source and the prediction of the model. However, although it is

Figure 7.14: Comparison of the longitudinal profile between the source results and the muons at 90 degrees results for the two extended barrels.

possible to understand the average behaviour within a 5% precision, it becomes more and more difficult to understand things when we look for effects at the level of one or two percent.

Reliability of muon data and bundle effects

First, the ratio of two structures read by the same PMT and by the same fibres for muon data vs the same ratio for source data is plotted in figure 7.15. There the ratios for all tiles, except the ones of tiles 5 and 7, are well correlated following a slope of 45\({}^{\circ}\). The set of source ratios (the same for muons) covers a wide range due to the intrinsic light yield difference between two tile rows read by the same fibre. If other disuniformities are present they can also contribute to increase the intrinsic difference. However, when the same plot but with the ratio of two structures read by the same PMT but by different fibres is done (figure 7.16) the correlation is worse. What is more interesting is that, once more, the ratios where tile 7 intervenes, show a different behaviour. This fact, added to the discrepancy already observed in the comparison of the longitudinal profiles between source and muon data, seems to be an evidence that something is wrong in the data from tile row 7. One of the corrections that may only be true to first approximation is the use of the same cross-talk factor for all cells in tile row 3 and tile row 7. The better understanding of this would require more effort, but it has been decided not to devote more time to the cross-talk as it is an incident of the 1997 modules and will disappear in the future.

The correlation is worse when doing ratios of structures coming from tile rows read by the same fibre with respect to the ratios of structures coming from tile rows read by different fibres, as can be understood from figure 7.17.

Figure 7.15: Figure 7.16:

The muon response vs source response has been plotted for different tile rows (all in sample 2, but the same behaviour was observed for sample 3). Tile row 5 is the one used for calibration, which means that their response values should have a dispersion lower than 2% (or slightly more due to the down drift effect). As can be seen in the upper plot in figure 7.17, the source responses for tile row 5 have small dispersion but this is not the case in the muon responses. In the same plot we also have the responses for tile row 7, which have a larger value as has been previously pointed out. They correspond to different tiles, but read by the same fibres reading tile row 5. The dispersion in the source data is slightly higher than for tile row 5, most likely due to uncertainties in the cross-talk correction, but the dispersion in muons is at the same level as for tile 5. The lower plot in figure 7.17 shows the responses for tile rows 4 and 6. They are in the same sample than the previous ones, so they are read by the same PMTs, but their fibres are different than the ones of tiles 5 and 7. It is interesting to observe that there the dispersion in the source axis is larger and at the same level as that for muons. From these distributions, then, the following can be concluded:

Figure 7.17:

1. Muons have large dispersions due to uncontrolled effects (noise, the algorithm to extract the response, etc). These dispersions make them unsuitable to check possible disuniformities observed with source data at the level of a few percent. The comparison between muon data and source data is useful for the longitudinal profile studies.
2. It has been observed that either the routing (at the level of sub-bundles) and/or the transparency of the profiles have important contributions to the dispersions in the response observed within a tile row. When looking at the tile rows used for calibration (or the tile rows read by the fibres reading tiles of calibration), the disuniformities are within the required calibration precision. However, the responses from the tile rows of the same sample read by different fibres have larger disuniformities.

The particular case of sample 1

In the preceding subsection the discussion was only about samples 2 and 3. This is because something different happens in sample 1, as can be seen in figure 7.18. The dispersions of tile rows 1 and 2 are more or less the same (tile row 2 is the calibration tile), but dispersion in tile row 3 is very large. It is difficult to understand the origin of this difference, but it is clear that it has nothing to do with the routing, as tile rows 1 and 2 are read by different fibres. Possible effects contributing to the dispersion in tile row 3 are:

* Tile rows 1 and 2 have cut profiles (see section I.4 for a detailed explanation). So, if the amount of light lost due to the transparency of the profiles varies depending on the exact position of the fibre in the profile or on characteristics of the profile, this could cause uncontrolled disuniformites in tile row 3 not present in tile rows 1 and 2.
* Tile row 3 suffers from cross-talk. The correction applied the same factor for all channels, but again, the cross-talk factors vary from cell to cell (this is known qualitatively). As the tile used for gain-setting is tile row 2, the dispersions due to a incorrect cross-talk correction will remain or even will be augmented if they go in the opposite direction as the original (before gain-setting) dispersions in tile row 2.

### 7.5 Conclusions

The results presented in this chapter have shown that the light yield of the modules after gain setting is understood only in first approximation. The model, with a simple parameterisation of the light yield of tiles and fibres, predicts a light yield for the different tiles rows that is in agreement with the one obtained with real data (both source and muon data).

However, as in the Barrel Module 0, some unpredicted behaviour has appeared. Tile rows 3 and 7 presented a response higher than expected. These two tile rows are the only ones that need a correction for the cross-talk. For tile row 3, we have good agreement between source and muon data and the discrepancy with the model prediction could be due to the cut profiles in tile rows 1 and 2. But for tile row 7 the source response is higher than the muon response. This discrepancy could be due to the cross-talk correction applied to the source data. For simplicity the cross-talk correction used was the same for both tile rows as the factors extracted (see appendix I) were not so different.

The muon data have presented some problems. The comparison was only done with the ANL module, as the muon results for the BCN module presented large dispersions that come

Figure 7.18:from the presence of coherent noise. And, even in the ANL module the dispersions within a tile row were larger than for the source data. The muon data has been useful to check the longitudinal profile, i.e. the average response in the module. However, the dispersions in the muons make them not suitable to check effect at the level of a few per cent.

From the absolute light yield study before the gain setting an anomaly was detected, and it was checked that for the Barrel this anomaly was not present. The difference between the model prediction and the source data was larger in the BCN module. As for the comparison with the model we need an arbitrary normalisation it is not possible to establish which are the samples giving an anomalous light yield. The origin of this is not yet understood, and will need to be checked again in next test beams when the cross-talk is corrected. It may be related to the way fibres were routed to the PMTs.

Once more, as it was shown for the Barrel Module 0, the performance of the calibration system has fully satisfied its requirements. A monitoring of the response of the calorimeter was done during about eight months, and as it is explained in the apendixes the data extracted with the source intercalibration system was very useful as a diagnostic tool of a problem in the optics (the cross-talk) and in the light response of the modules (the down drift). For the first problem it also provided data to measure the cross-talk parameters. For the second, source data was one of the main tools used looking for the culprit, thanks to the precision of the measurements and the long time period covered by the monitoring.

As the last point, the contribution of the dispersions observed to the constant term of the resolution of the calorimeter should be discussed. A detailed study of the effect of the dispersions in the resolution will be done, but is not present in this work. However, with the exception of tile rows 3 and 7, the intrinsic dispersions of the average response per tile row are the ones expected by the model, and their contribution to the constant term in the energy resolution would be within the requirements.

## 8.- Conclusions

The Cs source system has been presented and the data from the first Barrel and Extended Barrel module 0s analysed.

The test beam of the 1996 summer, where the Barrel Module 0 was tested, lead to the choice of the hydraulic drive as the one to be used in the final ATLAS source system design. The improvements in the system towards the final design were tested in the Extended Barrel Module 0s test beam and proved to be satisfying almost all the requirements. The final design will be ready by the end of 1998.

The source system has been shown to be a precise and quick tool to intercalibrate the cells in the Tile Calorimeter. Intercalibration of all cells in a module has been done in three or four iterations to the level of 1-2%.

The source calibration system has become a powerful utility, not only for the calibration itself but also as a tool for quality control of the calorimeter modules. The quality control of the optics is intrinsic to the way that the source data is taken. The raw data can be displayed as one structure per tile row and cell. Every tile in the calorimeter can be seen thanks to the sampling frequency used for the data taking and to the range of \({}^{137}\)Cs photons in the calorimeter structure. This allows to detect problems in the tile-fibre coupling or possible lower light yield in one or a group of tiles or fibres. Apart from that, the high precision of the measurements at the level of 0.2% gave the possibility to monitor the stability and detect rapidly changes as the so-called down drift. And, in addition to this, the improvement done for the 1997 test beam, where all the PMTs in a drawer were read, lead to the discovery of the transparency of the profiles, origin of the optical cross-talk. Finally, the fact of reading all the PMTs allows the measurement of the additional structures that appear in the neighbour samples due to the range of photons in the calorimeter.

The analysis of the source data before the gain setting has shown a new utility of the source calibration system. It can be used to compare the absolute light yield of two modules and detect if any anomaly is present. This was the case for the two Extended Barrels, where the anomaly most probably comes from the fibre routing.

The analysis of the source data after the gain setting focused on the understanding of the light yield of the modules tested. The longitudinal profile was used for this. The shape of theprofile is well understood as shows the agreement with the model parameterising the response of fibres and tiles. The main discrepancies that appeared can be corrected in next modules. For the Barrel Module 0, tile rows in the second subsample of sample 2 presented a larger light yield but this can be corrected adding 10 cm to the fibres reading those tiles. And in the Extended Barrel Module 0s, only the tile rows suffering from cross-talk corrections had a poorly predicted light yield that should disappear after the transparency of the profiles is cured.

The individual light yield response, however, is not as well understood as the tile row average response. The dispersion of the PMTs reading the different cells for a given tile row are in a lot of cases larger than the dispersions predicted by the model. The results in chapters 6 and 7 showed that a main contribution to these dispersions seems to come from the routing of the fibres to the PMTs, specifically at the level of sub-bundles. An effort to understand qualitatively and quantitatively the effect on the fibre light yields of the bending and stressing due to the routing must be done.

The understanding of the non-uniformity of the response in the calorimeter goes further than a mere interest on the comprehension of the physic effects contributing to the light yield. It is necessary to control the dispersions under a 10% in order not to spoil the required constant term in the resolution of the calorimeter. The fact of reading two tiles with the same fibre introduces an intrinsic non-uniformity not larger than 5%, so the other effects should be controlled better than 5%. It has been shown that random disuniformities are not too dangerous in terms of resolution. However, in the Barrel Module 0 a systematic disuniformity was found for those tiles in the second subsample of sample 2. It has been understood how to cure it by increasing the appropriate fibre lengths, but in any case a study of the effect of such systematic disuniformites should be done to know at which level they can be tolerated. Such study has been started, but the results are not yet ready.

The source calibration results have been checked with muons impinging at 90 degrees with respect to the tile plane. They have shown good agreement, both for the Barrel and the Extended Barrels, in the longitudinal profile comparison. However, muon results present large dispersions, as they have been affected by electronics noise and pedestal subtraction, hence they are not suitable for checks at the one or two per cent level (especially for the extended barrels).

Finally, after what has been learnt, some improvements to the source calibration algorithm can be proposed. Both from the Barrel and from the Extended Barrels experience the importance of routing sub-bundles in the dispersions within a tile row observed was found. If only one tile row per sample is used for calibration the dispersions are forced to group in the tile rows read by the other set of fibres. This produces large differences in dispersion amongst the tile rows. The dispersions can not be cured by using the source calibration, but if the average over at least one tile row read by each group of different fibres per sample is used for the gain setting the dispersions could be optimised to affect less the constant term of the resolution. The average over all tile rows in a sample can also be used, and in fact this should be the best choice. However, using all tile rows in a sample should not be better than using the average of one of the tile rows read by each group of fibres unless some unpredicted and not yet observed effect is present.

To conclude with this study a remark should be done. The unsolved problems presented in this study are not related with the source calibration system itself, but with the optics and electronics of the calorimeter. Even though these problems should be further investigated and cured if possible, as the test beam results have shown, the performance of the calorimeter is within the ATLAS requirements. The source calibration system has been shown to be able to fully satisfy its requirements for the final ATLAS calibration design. In addition to its calibration functions, it has been shown to be a powerful utility as a diagnostic tool for light yield problems, thanks to its performance and the data it provides to analise such problems.

I.- Measurement of the Optical Cross-Talk for the Extended Barrel Module 0s Using Source Calibration Data

### I.1 First look at the Cs data and a useful diagnostic

During July 1997, the first runs with the new Cs calibration software were taken. The main difference with respect to the data acquisition system of the previous year was that all PMTs were read at all times. Thanks to this, the so-called ghost structures were going to be measured for the first time. These ghost structures appear due to the range of photons in the calorimeter6 when the source is going through the hole in a tile row nearest to the following sample. For example, when the source is crossing tile row 3 it goes through the outer hole, then ghost structures will appear in sample 2 due to the energy deposited in tile row 4. The correction for this effect previously applied was called the m factor and had been estimated by MC simulation and was shown to be in agreement with source data obtained in the TILECAL prototype modules (tested between 1993 and 1995). With the system used for the 1997 test beam one could obtain a measurement of this factor, and a cross-check with previous results. However, the fact that this acquisition system can measure all PMTs simultaneously has provided a quick way to detect an anomaly in the modules and has also given the information to quantify this effect.

### I.2 A nice diagnosis made by the Cs source system

The first Cs run of 1997 with all PMTs set to their nominal HVs, but with the system for the electronics cooling off, was run 1084. This was the run that gave the first clue of a problem7. A picture of all the signal "structures" for all PMTs is shown in figure I.1. The horizontal axis is the measurement number corresponding approximately to 3 mm intervals along the source transport tubing.

The response of one of the PMTs reading cell A15 vs the measurement number following its travel along the whole path of the source is shown in figure I.2 (it was PMT 30). The example was taken from run 1084 and the source travel direction was from ANL to BCN module (first cell seen by the source was cell A16). First the three expected structures corresponding to the three times that the source was going through this cell are seen: first through tile row 1, then tile row 2, and finally tile row 3 (measurement number around 4000, 5500 and 6750 respectively). But the unexpected structures coming from places in the path of the source corresponding to tubes located externally in radius with respect to cell A15 are noticed. All structures have the width of cell A15. The amplitude of these unexpected structures is constant as the source goes further away from the cell and corresponds to roughly 25% of the calibration signal. A study of all PMTs shows unexpected signal in cells A (B and A) when the source moves through cells B and D (D), but the inverse does not happen. The

Figure I.1: All the structures for all the PMTs for run 1084

fact that the fibres of cells A (B) pass over cells B and D (D) in the plastic profiles, but not the opposite, leads to the conclusion that the profiles are somewhat transparent.

Verification of these data came from a Cs run taken in Barcelona8 at the end of May with a different moving mechanism, which had been used for the prototypes. The source was moved in tube 5 and all PMTs were read. Main structures are seen for all B cells as expected, but additional unexpected signals at the 25% level were seen in the A cells. No signal was observed in the D cells, which agrees with the transparent profile hypothesis.

Lab measurements of a tile illuminated by a Co source and read out by fibres attached to the tile and/or being in profiles were done [1]. The measurements can be summarised in the table below. As can be seen, the measurements verified the suspicion that the profiles were transparent.

### I.3 Analysis with the Cs calibration data

As has been shown, due to the transparency of the profiles, light is seen in some cells where, in fact, no energy has been deposited. The aim of this analysis is to allow the unfolding of the data. Such unfolding should give the "real" signal corresponding to the energy deposited in each cell.

The first step is to understand which is the effect of the cross-talk, and to parameterise it with some physical parameters that later on will allow to unfold the data taken. For this reason a _"Cross-talk Matrix_" was built. If all the parameters in this matrix are known with good precision, then the unfolding of the data should be possible.

* **The Cross-talk Matrix** We will define a set of parameters to be determined using Cs data.
* the containment factor
* Cross-talk parameter due to source going through tile i in cells in sample 1 (i=4,..,11).
* Cross-talk parameter due to source going through tile j in cells in sample 2 (j=8,...,11).
* Light yield for tile k (as source is going through the outer hole).
* Ratio of light yields of a tile row as source goes through the inner or outer hole.

### The m parameter

The source traverses a row of tiles in a cell through a hole situated at 15 mm from the edge. Due to the range of the photons in the calorimeter structure, about 78% of the energy is deposited in that tile row, and 22% in the closest neighbour. These values were estimated by Monte Carlo simulation and are in agreement with source data obtained with the Tilecalprototype. It has also been extracted from 97 data, with values fluctuating between 0.76 and 0.79.

#### The \(a\) parameters

These are the fraction of light seen, due to the transparency of the profiles, in the fibres of a tile row while the source is going through another tile row. The index shows the tile row where the source is going through. Without a prime, the cross-talk is from whatever tile row to a fibre read by a PMT in sample 1. With a prime, the cross-talk is from the tile row j to a fibre read by a PMT in sample 2.

#### The \(T\) parameters

When a PMT is read, it usually has light coming from different tile rows. But if the light yield of each tile row has to be extracted, then the response of each tile row has to be known independently. The Cs source goes through one of the holes in the tiles, but not always trough the same one. As has been seen, and will be explained in the following paragraph, the read-out light yield is different when the source is going through the outer or the inner hole. The \(T\) parameters extracted are defined as the light yield from a given tile row as if the source had gone through the outer hole (the inner hole could also have been chosen, but in the paragraph below the choice will be explained).

#### The \(r\) parameter

Measurements of the optical properties of the EB Module 0 tiles were done in the Barcelona Lab. A note has been written with the results [2]. One of the results was that the light yield of a tile depends on the zone where the energy is deposited. When comparing the zones of the Cs calibration (i.e. the outer and inner holes) to the central zone, what was seen is that in the inner zone about 10% less light is collected, while in the outer and central zone, the amount of light collected is almost the same. The \(r\) parameter was introduced in order to parameterise this effect. Now the reason to choose the outer hole to obtain the light yield per tile row is clear. Later on, source data should be compared to muons at 90 degrees data, and the muons impinge the tiles in this central zone.

Using these parameters the following matrix can be built.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & T\({}_{1}\) & T\({}_{2}\) & T\({}_{3}\) & T\({}_{4}\) & T\({}_{5}\) & T\({}_{6}\) & T\({}_{7}\) & T\({}_{8}\) & T\({}_{9}\) & T\({}_{10}\) & T\({}_{11}\) \\ \hline T\({}_{1}\)\({}^{\circ}\) & m & (1-m)r & & & & & & & & & \\ \hline T\({}_{2}\)\({}^{\circ}\) & m & (1-m)r & & & & & & & & & \\ \hline T\({}_{3}\)\({}^{\circ}\) & (1-m)ra\({}_{4}\) & m & (1-m)r & & & & & & & & \\ \hline T\({}_{4}\)\({}^{\circ}\) & (1-m)a\({}_{4}\) & (1-m)ra\({}_{5}\) & m & (1-m)r & & & & & & \\ \hline T\({}_{5}\)\({}^{\circ}\) & (1-m)ra\({}_{6}\) & ma\({}_{5}\) & & m & (1-m)r & & & & & \\ \hline T\({}_{6}^{\circ}\) & ma\({}_{6}\) & (1-m)ra\({}_{7}\) & & & m & (1-m)ra & & & & \\ \hline T\({}_{7}\)\({}^{\circ}\) & (1-m)ra\({}_{8}\) & ma\({}_{7}\) & & & (1-m)ra\({}_{8}\)\({}^{\circ}\) & m & (1-m)r & & & \\ \hline T\({}_{7}\)\({}^{\dagger}\) & (1-m)a\({}_{6}\) & mra\({}_{7}\) & & & (1-m) & mr & & & & \\ \hline T\({}_{8}^{\dagger}\) & mra\({}_{8}\) & (1-m)a\({}_{7}\) & & mra\({}_{8}\)\({}^{\ast}\) & (1-m) & mr & & & \\ \hline T\({}_{9}^{\dagger}\) & (1-m)a\({}_{8}\) & mra\({}_{9}\) & & & (1-m)a\({}_{8}\)\({}^{\ast}\) & mra\({}_{9}\)\({}^{\ast}\) & (1-m) & mr & & \\ \hline T\({}_{10}\)\({}^{\dagger}\) & mra\({}_{10}\) & (1-m)a\({}_{9}\) & & & mra\({}_{10}\)\({}^{\ast}\) & (1-m)a\({}_{9}\)\({}^{\ast}\) & & (1-m) & mr & \\ \hline T\({}_{11}\)\({}^{\dagger}\) & (1-m)a\({}_{10}\) & mra\({}_{11}\) & & & (1-m)a\({}_{10}\)\({}^{\ast}\) & mra\({}_{11}\)\({}^{\ast}\) & & & (1-m) & mr \\ \hline \end{tabular} Table 1.

The first column shows where the source was going through. The sub-index indicates tile row and the super-index if it was going through the outer (o) or inner (i) hole.

Some examples of how to write, using the Cross-talk matrix, some signal equations are given below. Suppose that the source is going through the outer hole of tile row 2. In that case, there will not be cross-talk, the cross-talk only goes from outer samples to inner ones. Then there will only be signal in sample 1, the PMTs in the other samples will be reading pedestals. The signal in sample 1 (sub-index) when source is going through tile row 2(super-index) can be written as:

\[S_{1}^{2}=mT_{2}+(1-m)rT_{3}\]

Now suppose that the source is going through the inner hole of tile row 9, i.e. in sample 3. The main signal will be in sample 3 and there will also be two cross-talk signals, one in sample 1 and one in sample 2. Written in terms of the cross-talk matrix these will be:

\begin{tabular}{l l l} \(S_{3}^{9}=mrT_{9}+(1-m)T_{8}\) & Main Signal, signal in sample 3 when source is going through tile row 9 \\ \(S_{3}^{1}=mra_{7}T_{9}+(1-m)a_{8}T_{8}\) & Crosstalk signal, signal in sample 1 when source is going through tile row 9 \\ \(S_{3}^{2}=mra_{9}^{\ast}T_{9}+(1-m)a_{8}^{\ast}T_{8}\) & Crosstalk signal, signal in sample 2 when source is going through tile row 9 \\ \end{tabular}

## I.4 The Longitudinal Profile

The Longitudinal Profile is the set of light yields per tile row for a module, in this case for the Extended Barrel Module 0s (EB0s). For a good performance of the calorimeter this longitudinal profile should be as flat as possible.

What was learnt with the Barrel Module 0, was that some disuniformities are expected due to the fact that different tile rows are read by the same fibres. Figure I.3 shows the longitudinal profile for the two EBs as predicted by the model. There can be perfectly seen the disuniformities due to the way the tile rows are read.

What the model tells is that if the tile response is really linear (as parameterised in the tile response) and the fibre lengths are correctly chosen, then no more disuniformities are expected. It is important to notice that in the model no parameterisation of the routing is taken into account, and that all the PMTs are thought to have the same gain.

\(\bullet\) **How the light yield for each tile row was extracted**

Due to the transparency of the profiles more curves than expected are seen. But, in order to obtain the longitudinal profile not all them must be used. Only the main structures, i.e. the ones read by the PMTs that read the fibres in contact with the tile row through which thesource is moving are needed. For each tile row a weighted average signal was calculated, where the weight was the number of tiles of that size in the corresponding cell.

There is one important thing to be aware of. This is the special case of tile rows 3 and 7 that, as they are the last tiles in a sample and the source is going through the outer hole, have a contribution to the signal coming from the cross-talk. For them the cross-talk parameter was fixed to 0.25 (looking at the structures the cross-talk effect was known to be at this level). Moving the cross-talk parameter from 0.2 to 0.3 the light yield obtained for the different tile rows did no vary a lot.

Also the containment factor was fixed at 0.78. This, as has been explained before, is in agreement with all the measurements of this factor known until now.

After all these settings were done, 12 equations remained (one for each tile row, except for tile row 7 where the source goes through the two holes) and 12 variables to determine (from T\({}_{1}\) to T\({}_{11}\) and the r parameter).

\(\bullet\) **Results and comparison with the model**

The set of equations explained above was solved for data from two runs for each module in order to cross-check the results. The chosen runs were 10435 and 10794 for the BCN EB and 10436 and 10795 for the ANL EB.

The tables of the results obtained can be found in section I.6, and they are plotted in figures I.4 to I.7. They can be summarised as follows:

1. The results are almost identical for the two runs in each module (except for the decreasing signal coming from the not yet understood down drift, see appendix II).
2. Comparing both modules the results are quite similar, but in the ANL module there is more dispersion.
3. The r extracted is always around 0.9, in agreement with the measurements done in the Lab.

The comparison with what the model predicts is shown in figures I.8 and I.9 (tables of results are also in section I.6), and the conclusions are the following.

1. Sample 3 is in agreement with the model (better for the BCN module).
2. In sample 1, light yield for tile 3 seems to be higher than expected (more pronounced in the ANL module).
3. In sample 2, the behaviour differs from what is expected (again more pronounced in the ANL module).

When looking at the preceding plots is useful to keep in mind that tiles 2, 5 and 9 were the ones used for the calibration. The normalisation was to normalise to the first tile row in each sample.

* **A possible explanation for the \(T_{i}\), \(T_{2}\) and \(T_{3}\) behaviour** It was difficult to find a reason for \(T_{3}\) to be higher than \(T_{i}\) and \(T_{2}\). Finally the problem was thought the other way round. What if it is OK, and \(T_{i}\) and \(T_{2}\) are too low?

To explain that, sample 1 should be carefully looked at. There are three rows of tiles: tile row 1 and tile row 3 are read by the same fibres, and tile row 2 by another set of fibres. The plastic profiles carrying the fibres reading tiles 1 and 3 finish at the end of the module, while the profiles carrying the fibres reading tile row 2 finish after tile 2 and just before tile row 1. Due to mechanical reasons the profiles had to be cut. The upper part of the profile, covering the three internal fibres and not in touch with the fibre reading the tile as shown in figure 5.5, was sliced from the end of the profile (tile row 1 or 2 in alternated profiles) to where tile row 3 starts. Now the question was whether we more light was lost in tile rows 1 and 2, due to the cut profiles. As there was no surface after the light had passed through the first side of the profiles, there were fewer reflections and the amount of light collected by those fibres could be smaller.

* **Conclusions for the Longitudinal Profile** The Longitudinal Profile presents some discrepancies from the model, in general smaller than 5% but bigger in some cases, but some could have an explanation (see chapter 7 for a detailed discussion about that). However, the aim of this study was to see how flat the profile was. Even taking into account these discrepancies, the profile is contained between 0.9 and 1.1. It should be understood if this \(\pm\)10% is good enough in terms of resolution of the calorimeter.

## I.5 The Optical Cross-talk Parameters

* **How the different cross-talk parameters were extracted** At this point the weighted light yield per tile row had already been calculated. This information was to obtain the cross-talk parameters. For them only the small signals were used, i.e. the cross-talk signals read by the PMTs that read the fibres going inside the profiles and collecting light that should have gone to another fibre in the same profile. Again, for each tile row a weighted average signal was calculated. The weight was, as in the Longitudinal Profile, the number of tiles of that size in the corresponding cell.

Two systems of equations had to be solved:

1. Using the cross-talk structures seen in sample 1. There were 9 equations and the variables to solve were from a\({}_{4}\) to a\({}_{11}\) and r.
2. Using the cross-talk structures seen in sample 2. There were only 4 equations and the variables to solve were from a\({}_{8}^{*}\) to a\({}_{11}^{*}\). r was fixed to 0.9.

In both systems, the light yield for each tile that had been extracted for the longitudinal profile was used.

* **Results and Conclusions** The runs used for the longitudinal profile were also used here. Tables of results can be found in section I.7 and the plotted results in figures I.10 to I.13, that can be summarised as follows:

1. The results are almost identical for the 2 runs in each module.
2. Differences are found when extracting the parameters using odd or even PMTs, reading up and down side of the tiles in the module (especially in the BCN module).
3. Except for BCN-even, we can have a single cross-talk parameter which adequately describes the cross-talk effect from a given sample to another.
4. The r extracted is in agreement with previous results.

The question was if these results were good enough to unfold the data. The response came from another study of the cross-talk done by Sergei Burdin with muons at 90 degrees. His results were completely in agreement with the ones presented in this appendix. In addition, studies of cross-talk effects with pions are also consistent.

## II The Down Drift

The planning for the source calibration system during 1997 was to do a monitoring period of some months to test if it was possible to maintain the cells intercalibrated during a long period. But after a few weeks an unexpected effect was seen. The responses of the different channels of the two modules were drifting down without any apparent reason. What is described below is how this was found and what was done to understand the problem. At the moment this report was written the effect seen could be only partially understood.

### First indications that something wrong was happening

The first runs were taken in July of 1997. The system was not completely stable due to final installation problems, but data looked OK. Since the beginning a source run was taken at least twice a week, then more often during the beam periods and when the problem appeared. There are only a few days when no data is available.

First indications of the problem came up at the beginning of the second test beam period, towards the end of September. After about 50 days since the first run was taken, a clear drop in the response of both modules could be seen using source calibration data (see figure II.1). To interpret the source response versus time one has to take into account the decay of \({}^{137}\)Cs, a drop of approximately 0.2% per month is expected. But the observed drop was much larger.

The drop continued until November when a series of systematic tests and checks were done during the following months. The aim was to investigate which was the cause of the drop, following the full chain from the energy released by the particles to the signal analysed.

### 2.2 Systematic study of the Down drift during the monitoring period

Here follows a summary of the work done by a team of people over a few months to try to understand the problem. It is not an exhaustive report, but rather an attempt to explain what has been learnt so far and to present some conclusions.

#### 2.2.1 Possible causes of the effect

There were a lot of possible causes, and as they contribute all together it was not easy to isolate the contribution of any single one. In the following paragraphs, a list of possible effects is reviewed: tiles, fibres, couplings, light mixers, PMTs, electronics and environment.

* **Tiles** Each individual TILECAL element is tested before being assembled in the module, but not always reproducing the exact conditions in the module, such as temperature, pressure and humidity. The tiles for the two extended barrels have been mechanically measured, their response to particles (using a radioactive source) tested, and measurements of radiation damage and ageing have been carried out.

In the case of the radiation damage test, where the equivalent dose of 10 years of running LHC had been supplied in two or three hours of intensive radiation. The measurements showed a large drop (more than 50%) but with a recovery along the following 24 hours. After that, the light yield stabilised about 10% lower than before the radiation test. The measurements were seen to be reproducible. The question that came when the down drift was observed was that maybe the radiation damage to big doses can not be extrapolated to small doses. Results about the damage due to small radiation doses are given in section 2.3.

The effect of ageing has been studied. There are continuous chemical reactions that are dominated by the concentration of reagents, the temperature, etc, which result in a deterioration of the main quality parameters of the scintillator (light yield and attenuation length). The rate of chemical reactions can be written as (Arrenius formula):

-d[A]/dt = k(T) [A]where [A] is the concentration of reagent A and k(T) is the temperature dependent value known as reaction rate constant. Using this formula it is easy to calculate the quotient of chemical reaction rate constants at different temperatures. For instance, at room temperature (20 \({}^{\circ}\)C - natural ageing) and at a higher one (70 \({}^{\circ}\)C - artificial ageing) and with an activation energy for polystyrene E=91.19 kJ/mol this quotient is equal to 235. Using this value and measuring scintillation tile properties after heating, one can evaluate possible degradation of scintillator resulting from natural ageing. Two sample of molded tiles were kept during 25 days at 70 \({}^{\circ}\)C (this corresponds to a natural ageing of 16 years) resulting a less than 10% deterioration of light yield by natural ageing during the LHC operation period.

A possible explanation for the down drift was that as the temperature, pressure and humidity conditions inside the module cannot be controlled with precision, maybe they were slowly changing and affecting the chemical composition and mechanical properties (thermal expansion) of the tiles. An attempt to make systematic tests controlling these parameters has been done and it is explained in section II.2.3.

Finally, the possibility of some dust being deposited in the surface of tiles and producing decrease of light yield was also possible.

* **Fibres**

Most of the possible effects for the fibres are similar to the ones of the tiles. Again, radiation damage tests had been done but only to the level of the total LHC radiation. The possibility of dust accumulated in the fibres could not be excluded. However, during the dismounting of the test beam setup, at the end of March, all the pieces were carefully studied and no prove of dust was found.

Another effect that could affect the fibres was the bending and stress due to the routing of the fibres from the tiles to the PMTs. Some studies have been done on the effect of bending a fibre that showed a reduction of light, but they cannot be directly applied to the realistic module routing.

* **Couplings**

Probably the least studied and controlled elements in the channel are the different couplings: coupling tile-fibre and coupling bundle-PMT. Mechanical vibrations of the module, due to the table movement when going from one test beam position to the other, could produce a displacement of the tiles or a movement of the profiles in the grooves that could affect the coupling and cause an improvement or deterioration. The same kind of vibration could cause small movements of the bundles or the PMTs.

Environmental changes inside the module and the effect of gravity in the module can change the couplings by contraction or expansion of the elements in the module due to temperature or other effects. In addition, dust could be accumulated in the surface of the bundle or in the surface of the light mixer. This was again discarded by the inspection of all the elements during the dismounting.

* **Light mixer**

Between the bundle and the PMT there is a light mixer to randomise information about the position of the fibres in the bundles. There has been no radiation damage tests done for this element. Moreover, during all the period, the drawers had to be opened and closed many times. As the space between the bundles and the light mixer is very small, there was a possibility that the surface had suffered some scratches that could be causing a decrease of signal, that was shown not to be true at the end of the monitoring period.

* **PMTs**

Another important element, always difficult to control, is the PMT. It is well known that the behaviour of the PMTs always present fluctuations, but of course, in general we do not expect this fluctuations to have a down drift. Most of the PMTs in the Extended Barrels were the same that the year before had been in the Barrel. We did look back to the 96 data to see if the drop was also there. The problem was that for the Barrel test beam data was only taken during a short period, something like 40 days, but there no drop could be seen.

The question that came was if the PMTs were being damaged, and some tests that will presented in section II.2.3 were done. There was also a possibility that the HV supplied to each PMT was drifting, producing a drift in the gain. And finally, the cooling of the drawer could be slowly drifting, increasing the temperature in the drawer and as a result producing a decrease of the gain of the PMTs.

* **Electronics**

The other element in the channel is the electronics. The source readout electronics is located inside the PMT block. There was an independent calibration of the electronics, and no drift was seen.

## Chapter 2 The down drift

### 2.1 The down drift

The down drift is a non-controlled area. So, the whole system suffered from changes of humidity, temperature, pressure, etc that have not been monitored until February. During the source monitoring period, that covered from July to March, the temperature inside the hall were the test beam was set (and also humidity) has showed an average variaton of less than 10\({}^{\circ}\) C. A large mass of iron and plastic (as we can describe the two Extended Barrels together with the old modules), will not follow quick fluctuations of temperature, but if there is a continous slow drift may have some effect.

### 2.2 What we learnt with the monitoring source data and other standard data

An easy test to do that can help to have a first impression of what is going on is to superpose two \({}^{137}\)Cs structures for the same cell taken at different times. This was done for PMT 24 (reading cell B13-UP) while the source was going through tile row 5. Figure 2.2 shows the structure coming from run 10653 taken on 10 October 1997 and the one from run 11024 taken on 28 January 1998 superimposed. As can be seen in the flat line corresponding to the ratio of the two structures, the drop was of 4% and, within the errors, the same for all the tiles in the cell. It is clear that if the problem is at the level of electronics, PMT or bundles one could expect this. The question is if it could be, that being the problem in the tiles or fibres or couplings, the net effect is the same for the different tile-fibre-coupling set. Also what seems to be clear is that it is not a problem of scratches in the light mixer. If this was the case, clearly we should see different drop for different fibres in the same structure and, of course, in different structures.

After the gain setting, the first thing that was looked at for each run, was the average response for all the PMTs (using the calibration tiles) and the dispersion of this average. In principle, one should expect the average to drop following the decay of the source and the dispersion to keep at the same level (with variations due to PMTs fluctuations). The down drift was precisely first seen looking at the plot of these averages vs time, but also the dispersion was becoming slowly larger. Individual channel response has been studied. The drift was seen in all the channels but its "slope" was different from channel to channel (as can be seen in figures II.3 and II.4). After that the channel to channel behaviour was carefully studied to see if there were some groups of PMTs looking the same. If the plots of the source response vs day for the different channels were put all together and following their location in the module, what was observed was that, in general, the PMTs reading the large cells showed a rate of drop higher than the others.

Coming back to the average response vs time for the two extended barrels but now for the complete period (from July 1997 to March 1998) it is clear that we could separate our study in different periods, as can be seen in figure II.5.

The first period before the 29 July is where the system was not yet stable, HV was on and off from time to time, the HV for the different PMTs had not been completely established, and there were four days of beam at the end.

After that there is a period of about 50 days, just before the October test beam. The system remained almost undisturbed (just source calibration runs from time to time). However, just before the test beam starting (end of September) a lot of interventions, not very well documented, had to be done on the modules to have them. This period shows a large drop, and is the one that still remains without explanation.

From day 60 to 105 (approximately) we have the second test beam period and some days of pion runs. At this point it was obvious that an effort was needed to understand what was going on. The first thing that was done was started the 21 November, and is called system monitoring in the figure. Until that moment there were systematic with the source system and data taking with the laser system. The laser based calibration system has the PMTs and light mixer in common with the source system, the light is introduced through some clear fibres and is read through the fast electronics. The calibration of the laser was not stable enough during this long period and these data could not be sued for the down drift study. However, a special test to read the laser response through the calibration electronics was started9, but due to the high intensity regime that was required, fluctuations on the intensity of the laser were too large to be useful.

Footnote 9: Idea from Manuel Delfino.

Finally, from day 180 until the end of the monitoring period, the intervention tests were done. There, the modules were disturbed on purpose and in the following section a detailed description of what was learnt can be found.

In the preceding paragraphs information that can be extracted from the usual source calibration data has been exploited. But some other information coming from the HV and the cooling system was available. Both systems had also a monitoring that allowed to see how stable they were. The measurements done untill November 1997 showed that they were stable within \(\pm\)0.2V for the HV and \(\pm\)0.2 degrees in the case of the cooling. No drift had been observed during the monitoring period nor in the HV supplied neither in the temperature of the cooling water. There was a drift in the actual temperature in the PMTs due to the fact that the temperature was kept constant in the cooling tank water, which was outside the module. There were some meters of tube before entering the drawers, and the temperature could suffer some small changes due to the temperature in the hall. The maximum change seen was of 1 degree during the total monitoring period, and as we will see in the specific tests, this cannot explain the drop seen.

#### Special tests looking for the culprit

After discussions in the November 1997 ATLAS meeting, it was decided that some specific tests should be done in order to eliminate, or try to eliminate, some of the elements of the channel from the list of possible culprits. Looking only at the source data, it was not easy to do that because we always had all the effects linked together. The plan was to force the module to changes, of HV, cooling, of environmental temperature, and see if the effect produced was as expected with what was known. What follows is a short description of the tests done and the conclusions after all them (we will not try to reproduce all the suspicions and thoughts that came during that period, but only what we got at the end).

* **Cooling tests** The temperature in the cooling tank was changed, in steps of 1 degree, from 17 to 22 degrees. The actual change in the drawer temperature was of about 4 degrees. The response obtained was as expected. As the temperature was increasing the response was decreasing due to a drop in the gain of the PMTs10. The drop observed, for a change of 4 degrees in the PMT, was of 1.5%. This effect had already benn seen (figure II.1 around day 40) when the cooling system had been accidentally set to the wrong temperature. After this test was done, it was clear that the small drift, of 1 degree, seen in the PMTs due to the effect of the hall temperature in the cooling water could not explain the drift seen in the source response. Also the possibility that the cooling itself was producing a drift was discarded, as the water temperature had been measured and seen stable within 0.2 degrees.

Footnote 10: The gain of a PMT depends on the number of dynodes in the multiplier section and the secondary emission factor \(\delta\), which is a function of the energy of the primary electron. The variation of the gain of a PMT with temperature has been studied although the results are not conclusive due to large variations from one experiment to the other. In principle, the secondary emission factor does not depend directly on the temperature, however, it may be indirectly affected by temperature-related changes in the surface properties of the dynodes, etc. A typical variation is a decrease of the order of a few tenths of a percent per increase of deg-K, however, it should be pointed out that this ratio not only seems to vary from one PMT type to the other, but also among tubes of the same type.

* **HV tests** In this case what was changed was the HV for some PMTs. The change was of \(\pm\)2 V with respect to the gain setting values. What was seen is that a change of two volts implied a change in the response of \(\pm\)2% respectively. This change was also seen with the laser calibration system. In principle then an effect due to the HV power supplies was discarded at this point because the measurements of the HV monitoring showed that the HV supplied was stable within 0.2 V.

## Appendix II The down drift

* **Laser baths** One of the longer tests done, that continued after the Greenhouse, explained in the following point, was that of illuminating the PMTs using the laser system. The reason to do that was that the laser system does not involve the tiles or readout fibres, and that it is read through different electronics. The laser baths usually followed this sequence: 10 million pulses at 1 kHz, several million pulses at 100 Hz (this is the frequency used for the laser calibration), then again 10 million pulses at 1 kHz and several million pulses at 100 Hz. The laser power was varied in a train of 16 pulses of different amplitudes. The results of this test were that after the sequence just explained a drop between 0.5 and 1% was observed (and it was a repeatable effect). Later, during the Greenhouse period, some laser baths with fixed amplitude pulses at different repetition frequencies were applied, to see if the only parameter that should be taken into account was the total charge received by the photocathodes, or if also the rate was important. The results were not conclusive and further investigation is needed.

* **The Greenhouse** One of the important differences of the test beam area with respect to the final ATLAS location is that the environmental conditions were not controlled at all. During a special test period it was decided to cover the modules, and to control the temperature, the pressure and the humidity. A system capable of heating and cooling the covered zone was mounted, and the conditions in the area and also within the modules were monitored for over a month.

When this test was started, in February 98, the temperature in the hall was of about 17 degrees. After covering and some days for stabilisation, the temperature in the area was of 19 degrees and in a location between the two modules 23 degrees. Later it was heated to 23 degrees outside the modules and the temperature in between the modules increased to 24.4 degrees.

The effect seen after the heating was a drop of about 0.5%. This is compatible with a change in the temperature of the cooling water entering the module due to a change in the ambient temperature. In fact the change in temperature in the PMTs during the heating was of 1 degree. From the cooling test we learnt that for a change of 4 degrees a 1.5% drop was found. So for a change of one degree, we expect a 0.4% drop, in agreement with what was seen. The temperature effect cannot then explain the down drift, a change of about 10 degrees in the drawer would have been needed to cause a 4% drift.

## 11 Source under one cell

To exclude the possibility that the source was producing a radiation damage in the tiles, a small test was proposed. The source was left for 15 hours in cell B13 (tile row 5) and at a fixed point, so if a radiation damage was produced we should see it only in a small number of tiles. What was found after the 15 hours, with a new source run, was that the response for the two PMTs reading that cell had decreased (by about 1%). This decrease was not only observed for the structure corresponding to tile row 5 (where the source was left) but to all of them. However, looking at the structure for that cell and tile row, comparing before and after the test, it was clear that there was no effect in the individual tiles were the source had deposited all the energy. The drop was the same for all them.

## 11 Some calculations and conclusions

The tests presented above can be separated in two types: tests of consistency (cooling, HV and Greenhouse) and tests to exclude elements of the channel. The firsts have shown that under some changes the module response vary as expected, and also have been a check of the good performance of the cooling and HV system.

What follows are some calculations to see if something can be concluded from the drops seen with the laser baths and the test of the source under one cell. There are also some calculations taking into account some pion runs taken at the end of the test beam period that will help us.

In the laser bath tests we saw a drop of around 1% with 40 million pulses. The average charge per pulse is of 30 pC at the anode of the PMT. So the total charge is:

40 x 10\({}^{6}\) pulses \(\cdot\) 30 pC/pulse = 1.2 x 10\({}^{3}\) C

For the test of the source under one cell there were 15 hours of source, and the current in the anode of the PMT is of 50 nA. In this case the charge received by that cell was:

50 x 10\({}^{\text{-9}}\) A \(\cdot\) 15 hours \(\cdot\) 3600 seconds/hour = 2.7 x 10\({}^{\text{-3}}\) C.

As the drop seen in the test of the source was almost the same than for the laser baths, one can conclude there is an effect in the PMTs and that a total charge of 10\({}^{\text{-3}}\) C produced a 1% loss of gain.

The last thing to test was if the particles had the same effect in the PMTs. For that some pion runs taken while TILECAL was secondary user of the beam were used. There were 10 days of pions of 180 GeV incident in tile row 6, and with shower maximum in cell B14 of theBCN module. To compute the total charge in the anode the following properties were taken into account. There were about \(10^{4}\) particles per burst, and 4 bursts per minute. From photostatiscs studies was known that about 0.25 pC/GeV arrived at the anode. Then the accumulated charge during the pion runs was:

10 days \(\cdot\) 24 hours/day \(\cdot\) 60 minutes/hour \(\cdot\) 4 bursts/minute \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{4}\) particles/burst \(\cdot\)180 GeV/particle \(\cdot\).25 pC/GeV = 2.4 x 10\({}^{2}\) C

The drop seen with this amount of charge, in cell B14, was of about 0.8%. If the effect does not depend on the rate, but only to the amount of charge, this drop should be much larger. Therefore, this could be an indication that the damage in the PMTs depends not only on the total accumulated charge, but also on the rate of charge arriving at the photocatode.

#### II.2.4 Tests in the lab

After the test beam setup had to be dismounted, some of the PMTs were tested in the lab. What was seen was a down-drift effect after a certain amount of charge at the same level of the one observed during the Laser and Source tests. However, the effect does not seem to be accumulative, because it the same amount of charge (and with the same rate) is supplied immediately after the first one, and we measure again, the drop is really smaller or no drop is present (depending on the PMT). However Hamamatsu could not reproduce the problem in other PMTs, and they have been sent to another Lab for more tests.

### II.3 Summary and conclusions

After the first long period of monitoring the two Extended Barrel Module 0s, some unsolved problems remain. As has been discussed a completely satisfactory explanation of the so-called down-drift has not been found. However, some effect in the PMTs linked to the light exposure that should be further investigated has been found. This loss in response caused after illuminating the PMTs with a certain amount of charge, cannot explain everything, however. There is still a period (from day 10 to 60 or so), where the down-drift was present, in fact it is a period with a large slope, which remains unexplained.

It is obvious, that this will be an important subject for the next test beam (July 1998), and that more tests will be done to study the effect. Unfortunately, untill now, there are not conclusive results.
