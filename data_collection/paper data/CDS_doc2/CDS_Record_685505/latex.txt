###### Abstract:

The ATLAS sensitivity to sequential charged heavy lepton pair production, as predicted, in particular, by various models with an extended gauge sector has been studied. Both the Drell-Yan and the gluon - gluon production processes are considered. Assuming Standard Model couplings, the discovery potential for the \(L^{\pm}\to(e,\mu)^{\pm}Z^{0}\to~{}(e,\mu)^{\pm}-dijet\) decay channel as a function of heavy lepton mass \(M_{L}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) boson mass \(M_{Z^{\prime}}\) is presented. For an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), it was found that ATLAS could discover this charged heavy lepton up to 0.9 TeV/c\({}^{2}\) and the discovery limit is pushed up to 1.0 TeV/c\({}^{2}\) for an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\).

## 1 Introduction

The new energy domain opened by the LHC will offer, in the near future, a unique opportunity to search for new particles predicted by models beyond the SM.

Several gauge groups with various theoretical motivations, containing \(SU_{C}(3)\times SU_{L}(2)\times U_{Y}(1)\) as a subgroup, provide a fermion representation with dimension larger than in the SM, and therefore predict the existence of new fermions. Among these theories are: composite models [1], left-right symmetric models [2], grand unified theories [3], technicolor models [4], superstring-inspired models [5] and models of mirror fermions [6].

The predicted new fermions can be classified [7] as: a) sequential fermions [8] obtained by adding to the known fermionic spectrum a fourth family with the same quantum numbers, b) vector fermions [5] introduced by the superstring inspired \(E_{6}\) models, c) mirror fermions [9, 10] with chiral properties opposite to those of ordinary fermions and d) singlet fermions [11, 12, 5].

New heavy gauge bosons, referred to as \(Z^{\prime}\) and \(W^{\prime}\), are typically predicted by any extension of the electroweak gauge theory and thus, the number of models involving new neutral and charged heavy gauge bosons is rather large. The simplest case, the SM-like \(Z^{\prime}\), is the case in which the couplings of the new \(Z^{\prime}\) boson are the same as those of a SM Z boson and there is no significant \(Z-Z^{\prime}\) mixing.

The ATLAS discovery potential for new heavy gauge bosons and new fermions has been already studied in [13, 14, 15, 16]. In [13] it was reported that \(Z^{\prime}\) boson could be observed in the di-jet decay channel, at an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\), up to 3-4 TeV. For an integrated luminosity of 300 \(fb^{-1}\), it was found [15] that a new massive right-handed Majorana neutrino \(N_{e}\) could be observed in the decay of a right-handed gauge boson \(W_{R}\) if \(M_{N_{e}}\) and \(M_{W_{R}}\) are smaller than 4 and 6 TeV, respectively and in [14] it was shown that a \(Z^{\prime}\) boson decaying into two right-handed Majorana neutrinos (\(N_{e}\)) could be observed if \(M_{N_{e}}\) and \(M_{Z^{\prime}}\) are smaller than 1.2 and 4.3 TeV, respectively.

The possible detection of exotic heavy leptons in ATLAS using a time-of-flight technique has been studied [16] and it was found that it should be possible to detect such leptons provided their masses are less than 950 GeV.

From the searches already done at LEP and the Tevatron, no evidence for the production of new heavy gauge bosons and charged leptons was found. We have taken into account the following limits : \(M_{Z^{\prime}}>700\)  GeV from CDF [17] and \(M_{L}>100\)  GeV from the results given by L3 [18].

Excited lepton production by contact interactions (\(q\bar{q}\to e^{*}e\)) at the LHC was studied [19] and the discovery limit obtained depends on the assumed scale of compositeness.

The results presented in this note assume sequential charged heavy lepton pair production by both Drell-Yan and gluon fusion mechanisms. The Feynman diagrams are presented in Fig.1 and Fig.2, respectively. The gluon fusion mechanism is playing a dominant role in the region of the lepton masses higher than 300 GeV [20]. We have assumed Standard Model couplings and a neutral current decay of both heavy charged leptons into an electron or muon and a Z boson, with a branching ratio [21] equal to \(B.R.(L\to l\ Z^{0})=1/3\). The signal and the background processes have been generated with PYTHIA [22] with the s heavy lepton pair production by gluon fusion included as a new external process [23]. The detector response was simulated with the parametrized Monte Carlo program ATLFAST [24], with default values of the parameters.

The note is organized as follows. In the next section the signal and the background are described and relevant conditions to reduce the background contribution are pointed out. In section 3 the event selection is analyzed and the discovery potential is derived as a function of \(M_{L}\) and \(M_{Z^{\prime}}\) in section 4. The gluon-gluon fusion cross section formula and its scale dependence is included in Appendices A and B, respectively.

## 2 Signal and background description

### The signal

The Drell-Yan processes studied include \(q\bar{q}\) anihilation into \((\gamma^{*}/Z^{0}/Z^{\prime})\) and their further decay into a pair of charged heavy leptons. For the gluon fusion process [20], Z and \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons decay into a pair of heavy charged leptons. Subsequently, the neutral current decay of each heavy charged lepton into an electron and two jets coming from the Z boson decay was considered:

\[q\bar{q}\rightarrow\big{(}\ \gamma,\ Z^{0},\ Z^{\prime}\ \big{)} \to L^{+}L^{-}\rightarrow(e,\mu)^{+}Z^{0}\ (e,\mu)^{-}Z^{0}\rightarrow(e,\mu)^{+}(e,\mu)^{-}+4\ jets \tag{1}\] \[gg\rightarrow\big{(}\ Z^{0},\ Z^{\prime}\ \big{)} \to L^{+}L^{-}\rightarrow(e,\mu)^{+}Z^{0}\ (e,\mu)^{-}Z^{0}\rightarrow(e,\mu)^{+}(e,\mu)^{-}+4\ jets \tag{2}\]

For simplicity, it was assumed here that the heavy lepton decays to one family of leptons (either e or \(\mu\)) with a short lifetime. Limits on the mixing of a heavy lepton with a SM lepton are given in [25].

Because heavy lepton pair production cross section by the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism via a \(Z^{\prime}\) intermediate boson is much smaller then via a Z\({}^{0}\) intermediate boson [26]

\[\left(\frac{\sigma_{Z^{\prime}}}{\sigma_{Z^{0}}}\right)_{gg}\simeq\left(\frac{M_ {Z}}{M_{Z^{\prime}}}\right)^{4}\simeq\left\{\begin{array}{ll}2.9\times 10^{-4}& \quad\mbox{if}\quad\;\;\;M_{Z^{\prime}}=0.7\ TeV/c^{2}\\ 6.9\times 10^{-5}&\quad\mbox{if}\quad\;\;\;M_{Z^{\prime}}=1.0\ TeV/c^{2}\\ 4.3\times 10^{-6}&\quad\mbox{if}\quad\;\;\;M_{Z^{\prime}}=2.0\ TeV/c^{2}\end{array}\right. \tag{3}\]

only the Z\({}^{0}\) intermediate boson case was studied.

The heavy lepton pair production cross sections as a function of the \(M_{L}\), for different \(M_{Z^{\prime}}\) values - 0.7, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 TeV/c\({}^{2}\), is presented in Fig.4 for each production channel (assuming that interference effects are negligible) to draw attention to the relative importance of the contribution. Even if it is very small relative to gluon fusion, off-shell \(\gamma\) and \(Z^{0}\) s-channel Drell-Yan heavy lepton pair production contribution matters only for \(M_{L}\) below 700 and 400 GeV/c\({}^{2}\), respectively. In Fig.4 we considered, \(\alpha_{S}=0.1\), as in [20], for the gluon fusion cross section. The scale dependence is presented in Appendix B, where we present a comparison between \(\alpha_{S}=0.1\), \(\alpha_{S}=0.2\), and two scales to calculate the strong coupling constant: \(\alpha_{S}(Q^{2}=\hat{s}=E_{CM}^{2})\) and \(\alpha_{S}(Q^{2}=p_{T}^{2}+m_{L}^{2})\).

In Fig.4 we summed up the Drell-Yan contribution, full \((\gamma^{*},Z^{0},Z^{\prime})\) and partial \((\gamma^{*},Z^{0})\) interference. For \(M_{L}>400\ GeV/c^{2}\) the gluon fusion contribution, for \(\alpha_{S}=0.1\), becomes dominant but there is also a significant contribution coming from the Drell-Yan mechanism. Without the \(Z^{\prime}\) channel the major contribution in the high mass region is coming from the gluon fusion production mechanism.

The signal signatures are the following:

* two opposite charge isolated electrons or muons
* four jets from two \(Z^{0}\) boson decays
* low \(E_{T}^{miss}\)

### The background

The following background processes have been considered:

* the dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) events; \(t\)\(\bar{t}\to b\)\(\bar{b}\)\(W^{+}\)\(W^{-}\)\(and\)\(W\rightarrow(e,\mu)+\nu_{(e,\mu)}\)
* other dileptonic processes where \(Z\rightarrow(e,\mu)^{+}+(e,\mu)^{-}\) and \(W\rightarrow(e,\mu)+\nu_{(e,\mu)}\): \(W\)\(W+jets\), \(WZ+jets\), \(ZZ+jets\), \(H+jets\), \(ZH+jets\)

The dominant background for our signal process is \(t\bar{t}\) pair production due to its high production cross section, but an important signature of the dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) process is the high value of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) due to the escaping neutrinos.

## 3 Event selection

A detailed description of the ATLAS detector and its performance can be found in reference [27]. In this note the detector response was simulated with the parametrized Monte Carlo program ATLFAST [24], with default values of the parameters for low and high luminosity. Jets were reconstructed with the cone algorithm, requiring a cone radius of 0.4 and a minimum \(E_{T}\) of 15 GeV. The jet energy resolution was parametrized according to the luminosity conditions assumed in the analysis. The electrons and muons were required to be isolated.

The events were generated with heavy charged lepton and gauge boson masses in the interval:

\[0.1\ <M_{L}\ (\ TeV/c^{2}\ ) <\ 1.2 \tag{1}\] \[0.7\ <M_{Z^{\prime}}\ (\ TeV/c^{2}\ ) <\ 2.0 \tag{2}\]

taking into account the experimental limits mentioned in the introduction.

The event selection criteria required:

* at least 2 isolated (\(e^{+}e^{-}\)) or (\(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\)) with \(p_{T}>20\ GeV\)
* at least 4 jets with \(p_{T}>20\ GeV\)

which will also be used for the trigger.

The percentage of events that comply with the above constraints can be seen in the Table 1 and Table 2, for different \(M_{Z^{\prime}}\) values. The very high jet multiplicity (see Fig.5) is explained by initial and final state radiation and the interaction of the proton remnants. As we can see in Fig.6, a 5-th jet veto cut is not useful. In many events, zero or only one electron is detected because high \(p_{T}\) electrons or muons are produced very close to the di-jet system and can overlap with the jet reconstruction cone.

In order to reduce the combinatorial background, our analysis was carried on using

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{\(4~{}jets+2~{}muons~{}with~{}p_{T}>20~{}GeV\)} \\ \hline \(M_{Z^{\prime}}\) & \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{\(M_{L}\) ( \(GeV/c^{2}\) )} \\ \cline{2-5} ( \(TeV/c^{2}\) ) & 200 & 300 & 400 & 500 & 600 \\ \hline
0.7 & 53.9 & 59.3 & 70.3 & 72.3 & 73.5 \\ \hline
1.0 & 55.7 & 63.6 & 65.1 & 70.7 & 72.4 \\ \hline
1.5 & 56.8 & 65.0 & 68.1 & 68.3 & 68.3 \\ \hline
2.0 & 58.1 & 65.8 & 68.7 & 69.0 & 68.0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: At least 4 jets and 2 muons with \(p_{T}~{}>20~{}GeV\) selection efficiency, in %.

the following kinematical selection, applied for all cases studied:

* the candidate leptons were the 2 isolated electrons or muons with the highest \(p_{T}\)
* at least one jet with \(\ p_{T}\ >\ 100\ GeV\) (Fig. 8 and Fig. 10)
* at least one electron or muon with \(\ p_{T}\ >\ 150\ GeV\) (Fig. 8 and Fig. 10)

**Figure 7:** Highest jet \(p_{T}\) distribution for signal (\(L\to e+Z^{0}\)) and background.

**Figure 8:** Highest electron \(p_{T}\) distribution for signal (\(L\to e+Z^{0}\)) and background.

**Figure 9:** Highest jet \(p_{T}\) distribution for signal (\(L\rightarrow\mu+Z^{0}\)) and background.

**Figure 10:** Highest muon \(p_{T}\) distribution for signal (\(L\rightarrow\mu+Z^{0}\)) and background.

The \(t\bar{t}\) production, with its high production cross section, will give the most important background contribution. The background contribution from the dilepton and jets events, mentioned above, is very small due to the low fraction of events with 4 jets and 2 isolated electrons or muons with \(p_{T}>20~{}GeV\).

The absence of neutrinos in our signal events suggests the use of a selection on \(p_{T}^{miss}\). Requiring a low value of \(p_{T}^{miss}\) is expected to be a very efficient means of background reduction.

The \(p_{T}^{miss}\) and the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) mass distributions are presented in Fig.11 and Fig.12 for signal and the dilepton and jets and \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds. We can observe an important difference between the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) spectra of the signal and the \(t\bar{t}\) background and the \(m_{e^{+}e^{-}}\) values are clearly higher for the signal. The \(p_{T}^{miss}\) cut will strongly reduce the \(t\bar{t}\) background while \(m_{e^{+}e^{-}}\) cut will eliminate the dilepton and jets background contribution and will considerably decrease the \(t\bar{t}\) background.

The invariant mass of the two electrons coming from the decays of the heavy leptons is also expected to be a significant selection criterion due to large values of the \(m_{e^{+}e^{-}}\) distribution in the signal.

According to the kinematical analysis presented above the following cuts have been applied:

\[p_{T}^{miss} < 100~{}GeV~{}~{}~{}(Fig.11) \tag{3.3}\] \[m_{e^{+}e^{-},\mu^{+}\mu^{-}} > 200~{}GeV~{}~{}~{}(Fig.12) \tag{3.4}\]The efficiency of the cuts used in this analysis is presented in Table 3 for signal and \(t\bar{t}\) background, for the case \(M_{L}=0.7~{}TeV/c^{2}\) and \(M_{Z^{\prime}}=1.5~{}TeV/c^{2}\).

We begin the analysis by reconstructing the two \(Z^{0}\) bosons from the combinatorial di-jet invariant mass spectra. To minimize the number of fake-combinations, we selected only pair combinations that gives the best \(Z^{0}\) mass reconstruction requiring:

\[\left|~{}M_{(jet_{a},jet_{b})}-M_{Z^{0}}~{}\right|~{}+~{}\left|~{}M_{(jet_{c}, jet_{d})}-M_{Z^{0}}~{}\right|~{}=~{}minimum \tag{10}\]

and at the same time the following requirement

\[\Delta R(jet_{a},jet_{b})~{}=~{}\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}_{(jet_{a},jet_{b})}+ \Delta\phi^{2}_{(jet_{a},jet_{b})}}~{}=~{}minimum \tag{11}\]

where (a,b,c,d)=1,...,njet, njet is the number of reconstructed jets.

Fitting the di-jet invariant mass distribution around the \(Z^{0}\) peak we obtained the reconstructed \(Z^{0}\) mass \(M^{rec}_{Z^{0}}\) and the standard deviation \(\sigma^{rec}_{Z^{0}}\) for the width of resonance. These values were further used for the \(Z^{0}\) boson selection:

\[M^{rec}_{Z^{0}}-3\cdot\sigma^{rec}_{Z^{0}}<M_{di-jet}<M^{rec}_{Z^{0}}+3\cdot \sigma^{rec}_{Z^{0}} \tag{12}\]

For the heavy lepton mass reconstruction we have selected among two possible combinations of \((e,\mu)^{(\pm)}_{(1,2)}\) and \(Z^{0}_{(1,2)}\) the \(\left(M_{(e,\mu)^{(\pm)}_{i}Z^{0}_{i}}~{},~{}M_{(e,\mu)^{(\pm)}_{j}Z^{0}_{j}}\right)\) pair that complies with the following requirement:

\[\left|~{}M_{(e,\mu)^{(\pm)}_{i}Z^{0}_{j}}~{}-~{}M_{(e,\mu)^{(\pm)}_{k}Z^{0}_{ l}}~{}\right|~{}=~{}minimum \tag{13}\]

The selected \(M_{(e,\mu)^{\pm}_{(1,2)}Z^{0}_{(1,2)}}\) invariant mass distribution, according to the condition presented in the equation 13, is presented in the Figure 13 for the electron channel (\(L\to eZ^{0}\)) and in Figure 14 for the muon channel (\(L\to\mu Z^{0}\)) respectively, together with the background contribution, for \(M_{L}=0.5~{}TeV/c^{2}\) and \(M_{Z^{\prime}}=0.7~{}TeV/c^{2}\).

Both \(L^{\pm}\to e^{\pm}+Z^{0}\) and \(L^{\pm}\rightarrow\mu^{\pm}+Z^{0}\) decay channels provide us with a reasonable charged heavy lepton reconstructed mass distribution and a well separated signal from background (see Figs. 14 and 14).

The mean value (\(<M_{L}^{rec}>\)) of the reconstructed sequential charged heavy lepton mass distribution is the same for both decay channels but the width (\(\sigma_{L}^{rec}\)) for the muon channel \(L^{\pm}\rightarrow\mu^{\pm}+Z^{0}\) is wider than the width for the electron channel \(L^{\pm}\to e^{\pm}+Z^{0}\). An illustration for \(M_{L}=0.5~{}TeV/c^{2}\) and different \(M_{Z^{\prime}}\) values is presented in Table 4.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \((GeV/c^{2})\rightarrow\) & \(M_{Z^{\prime}}\) & \(\sigma_{L}^{rec}\) & \(\frac{\sigma_{L}^{rec}}{<M_{L}^{rec}>}\) (\%) \\ \hline \(L^{\pm}\to e^{\pm}+Z^{0}\) & 700 & 26.25 & 5.07 \\ \(L^{\pm}\rightarrow\mu^{\pm}+Z^{0}\) & 700 & 28.28 & 5.77 \\ \hline \(L^{\pm}\to e^{\pm}+Z^{0}\) & 1000 & 26.41 & 5.12 \\ \(L^{\pm}\rightarrow\mu^{\pm}+Z^{0}\) & 1000 & 28.78 & 5.88 \\ \hline \(L^{\pm}\to e^{\pm}+Z^{0}\) & 1500 & 23.70 & 4.56 \\ \(L^{\pm}\rightarrow\mu^{\pm}+Z^{0}\) & 1500 & 26.41 & 5.39 \\ \hline \(L^{\pm}\to e^{\pm}+Z^{0}\) & 2000 & 23.70 & 4.72 \\ \(L^{\pm}\rightarrow\mu^{\pm}+Z^{0}\) & 2000 & 27.18 & 5.54 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: The ratio between the standard deviation \(\sigma_{L}^{rec}\) and the mean value \(<M_{L}^{rec}>\) of the reconstructed heavy lepton mass distribution, for different \(M_{Z^{\prime}}\) values and for \(M_{L}=500~{}GeV/c^{2}\).

A comparison between the muon and the electron decay channels is shown in Figures 16 and 16, for \(M_{Z^{\prime}}=1.0\) and \(2.0\) TeV/c\({}^{2}\). The ratio between the width (\(\sigma_{L}^{rec}\)) and the mean value (\(<M_{L}^{rec}>\)) obtained by a gaussian fit of the charged heavy lepton reconstructed mass spectra \(M_{(e,\mu)_{(1,2)}^{\pm}Z_{(1,2)}^{0}}\) for both \(L^{\pm}\to e^{\pm}+Z^{0}\) and \(L^{\pm}\rightarrow\mu^{\pm}+Z^{0}\) decay channels. At high heavy lepton energies, the muon resolution is worse than the electron resolution. For heavy lepton mass \(M_{L}\) greater then \(400\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\) we can see a clear separation between the two decay channels and for \(M_{L}<400\)\(GeV/c^{2}\) the heavy lepton mass spectra for both decay channels becomes more similar.

## 4 ATLAS discovery potential

For the ATLAS sensitivity to sequential charged heavy lepton pair production presented in this chapter, we have used as momentum transfer scale \(Q^{2}=\hat{s}\) to calculate the strong coupling \(\alpha_{s}(Q^{2})\). The \(Q^{2}\) dependence of the gluon fusion cross section is presented in Appendix B where three cases have been considered, two fix \(\alpha_{s}\)=0.1 and \(\alpha_{s}\)=0.2 and two \(Q^{2}\) values, \(Q^{2}=\hat{s}\) and \(Q^{2}=p_{T}^{2}+m_{L}^{2}\). A comparison between the signal significance obtained with the above mentioned \(Q^{2}\) values, is also shown in Appendix B.

Because for \(M_{L}>400\)\(GeV/c^{2}\) the lepton pair production is dominated by the gluon-gluon fusion mechanism via off-shell Z\({}^{0}\) s-channel propagator (\(gg\rightarrow\cdots\to Z\to L^{+}L^{-}\)) (see Figure 4), which does not depend on the existence of a new heavy gauge boson \(Z^{\prime}\) (equation 11), the ATLAS sensitivity to sequential charged heavy leptons is dictated by this gluon fusion production channel.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]

After three years of low luminosity (30 \(fb^{-1}\)) data taking, ATLAS can discover this sequential charged heavy lepton, up to \(M_{L}=0.9~{}TeV/c^{2}\) and the observability limit is increasing to \(M_{L}=1.0~{}TeV/c^{2}\) for a 300 \(fb^{-1}\) luminosity.

## 5 Summary and conclusions

This note was dedicated to ATLAS discovery potential for sequential charged heavy leptons produced by Drell-Yan and gluon-gluon fusion mechanisms

Two possible heavy lepton decay channels were considered, \(L^{\pm}\to e^{\pm}+Z^{0}\) and \(L^{\pm}\to\mu^{\pm}+Z^{0}\), with \(B.R.(L\to l~{}Z^{0})=1/3\), [21].

Both \(L^{\pm}\to(e,\mu)^{\pm}+Z^{0}\) decay channels provide us with a reasonable charged heavy lepton reconstructed mass distribution and a well separated signal from background.

Assuming Standard Model couplings, it was found that after three years of low luminosity (30 \(fb^{-1}\)) ATLAS can discover this sequential charged heavy lepton up to \(M_{L}=0.9~{}TeV/c^{2}\) and up to \(M_{L}~{}=~{}1.0~{}TeV/c^{2}\) for 300 \(fb^{-1}\) luminosity.

Single charged heavy lepton discovery limit will be further studied. It was shown [28] that single heavy lepton production is less dominant than the pair production, although the phase space is more reduced for the pair production than for single lepton production.

We will extend our analysis to different Beyond Standard Model theories. In the framework of the vector singlet model (VSM), vector doublet model (VDM) and fermion-mirror-fermion model (FMFM), it was found [30] that, in the case of lepton pair production by Drell-Yan mechanism \(q\bar{q}\to\gamma^{*},~{}Z^{0}\to L^{+}L^{-}\), for one year of high luminosity (100 fb\({}^{-1}\)) and for a heavy lepton mass \(M_{L}=200~{}GeV/c^{2}\), we will have 17500 lepton pairs produced for the VSM, 54800 for the VDM and 68400 for the FMFM, while we will have 24500 lepton pairs produced for the sequential model. In the minimal super-symmetric standard model (MSSM), where the charged heavy lepton is a member of a sequential 4th generation, it was found [29] that for heavy lepton pairs produced by gluon fusion mechanism \(\left(gg\to Z^{0}\to L^{+}L^{-}\right)\), for \(M_{L}\leq 250~{}GeV\) and for 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) luminosity, MSSM predict \(10^{5}\) events per year. The sequential model, used as reference in the present work, will produce by gluon fusion mechanism \(gg\to Z^{0}\to L^{+}L^{-}\) 1.24\(\times 10^{5}\) heavy lepton pairs if \(M_{L}=200~{}GeV\). For superstring-inspired E\({}_{6}\) model [31], in the same conditions as mentioned above, the contribution yields \(10^{4\pm 1}\) lepton pairs per year, which is a factor of at least 10 less than MSSM results.

Cross section modification due to models of extra dimensions [32], where the running of the coupling constants are changed, and of the fermion mass dependence, will be further investigated.

Calin Alexa would like to thank Georges Azuelos for helpful discussions during the preparation of this note. Also thanks to Irinel Caprini for proposing the gluon fusion cross section energy scale dependence topic to us and useful discussions.

A Gluon fusion cross section formula

The cross section for \(gg\rightarrow...\to Z\to L^{+}L^{-}\) process ([20], [29]) is given by the following relation:

\[\sigma=\frac{\alpha^{2}\alpha_{s}^{2}}{512\ \pi\sin^{4}\theta_{W}}\cdot\frac{M_{L} ^{2}}{M_{W}^{4}}\cdot\beta_{L}\cdot\ \left|\sum_{q=u,d}T_{3}^{q}\ (1+2\ \lambda_{q}\ I_{q})\ \right|^{2} \tag{10}\]

where \(\lambda_{q}=m_{q}^{2}/\hat{s}\), \(T_{3}^{q}\) is the quark weak isospin \(T_{3}^{q}=+(-)1/2\), \(\beta_{L}=\sqrt{1-4M_{L}^{2}/\hat{s}}\) is the lepton velocity in the c.m. of the subprocess, and \(I_{q}\)

\[I_{q}=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{dx}{x}\log\left[1-\frac{x(1-x)}{\lambda_{q}}\right] \tag{11}\]

Then

\[\sum_{q=u,d}T_{3}^{q}(1+2\lambda_{q}I_{q})=\sum_{q=u,d}T_{3}^{q}+2\sum_{q=u,d}T _{3}^{q}\ \lambda_{q}I_{q}=2\sum_{q=u,d}T_{3}^{q}\ \lambda_{q}I_{q} \tag{12}\]

because

\[\sum_{q=u,d}T_{3}^{q}=T_{3}^{u}+T_{3}^{s}+T_{3}^{b}+T_{3}^{d}+T_{3}^{c}+T_{3}^ {t}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2}=0 \tag{13}\]

We should not forget that the sum has to be multiplied by 2 because in the quarks triangle we have to reverse the sense also.

\[2\sum_{q=u,d}T_{3}^{q}\ \lambda_{q}I_{q}\to 4\sum_{q=u,d}T_{3}^{q}\ \lambda_{q}I_{q} \tag{14}\]

Then we have:

\[I_{q}=I_{q}(\lambda_{q})=-2\left[\arcsin\left(\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\lambda_{q}}} \right)\right]^{2},\ \ \ if\ \ \lambda_{q}\ >\ \frac{1}{4} \tag{15}\]

\[I_{q}=I_{q}(\lambda_{q})=\frac{1}{2}\log^{2}\left(\frac{r_{+}}{r_{-}}\right)- \frac{\pi^{2}}{2}+i\pi\log\left(\frac{r_{+}}{r_{-}}\right),\ \ \ if\ \ \lambda_{q}\ <\ \frac{1}{4} \tag{16}\]

where \(r_{\pm}=1\pm\sqrt{1-4\lambda_{q}}\).

After some calculations we obtain, for \(\lambda_{q}~{}<~{}\frac{1}{4}\) :

\[\left|\sum_{q=u,d}T_{3}^{q}(1+2\lambda_{q}I_{q})\ \right|^{2} = \left|\ 4\sum_{q=u,d}T_{3}^{q}\ \lambda_{q}I_{q}\ \right|^{2}\] \[= Re\left(\ 4\sum_{q=u,d}T_{3}^{q}\ \lambda_{q}I_{q}\ \right)^{2}+Im\left(\ 4\sum_{q=u,d}T_{3}^{q}\ \lambda_{q}I_{q}\ \right)^{2}\] \[= \left(\sum_{q=u}\lambda_{q}\left[\log^{2}\left(\frac{r_{+}}{r_{-} }\right)-\pi^{2}\right]-\sum_{q=d}\lambda_{q}\left[\log^{2}\left(\frac{r_{+}}{ r_{-}}\right)-\pi^{2}\right]\right)^{2}\] \[+ 4\pi^{2}\left[\sum_{q=u}\lambda_{q}\log\left(\frac{r_{+}}{r_{-} }\right)-\sum_{q=d}\lambda_{q}\log\left(\frac{r_{+}}{r_{-}}\right)\right]^{2}\] (A.9)

and for \(\lambda_{q}~{}>~{}\frac{1}{4}\) :

\[\left|\sum_{q=u,d}T_{3}^{q}(1+2\lambda_{q}I_{q})\ \right|^{2} = \left|\ 4\sum_{q=u,d}T_{3}^{q}\ \lambda_{q}I_{q}\ \right|^{2}\] \[= 16\left[\sum_{q=d}\lambda_{q}\arcsin^{2}\left(\frac{1}{2\sqrt{ \lambda_{q}}}\right)-\sum_{q=u}\lambda_{q}\arcsin^{2}\left(\frac{1}{2\sqrt{ \lambda_{q}}}\right)\right]^{2}\]

Using these relations, lepton pair production by gluon-gluon fusion was implemented in PYTHIA as an external process. Details will be presented in an ATLAS physics communication (in preparation).

B Scale dependence of the strong coupling \(\alpha_{S}\)

* In Figure 19 is presented the heavy lepton pair production cross section, for gluon fusion mechanism, considering two fix strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{s}=0.2\), as an extreme case, and \(\alpha_{s}=0.1\) and two momentum transfer scale to calculate the running strong coupling constant: \(Q^{2}=\hat{s}=E_{CM}^{2}\) and \(Q^{2}=p_{T}^{2}+m_{L}^{2}\), where \(p_{T}^{2}=\frac{\hat{u}\,\hat{t}}{\hat{s}}\).
* Only \(L^{\pm}\to\mu^{\pm}+Z^{0}\) decay channel is presented.
* In Figure 20 and Figure 21 we present a comparison between the total lepton pair production cross section, Drell-Yan and gluon fusion, for two \(M_{Z^{\prime}}\) values, 0.7 and 2.0 \(TeV/c^{2}\). We can see that the difference between \(Q^{2}=E_{CM}^{2}\) and \(Q^{2}=p_{T}^{2}+m_{L}^{2}\) is very small.
* Signal significance comparison, presented in Figure 22 and Figure 23, for \(M_{Z^{\prime}}=0.7\) and 2.0 \(TeV/c^{2}\), shows a small difference between \(E_{CM}^{2}\) and \(p_{T}^{2}+m_{L}^{2}\) only at low \(M_{L}\).
* The ATLAS sensitivity limit to this sequential charged heavy lepton remains almost the same for the above two values of the momentum transfer scale \(E_{CM}^{2}\) and \(p_{T}^{2}+m_{L}^{2}\).

Figure 19: Heavy lepton pair production cross section \(M_{L}\) dependence for different values of \(\alpha_{s}\). Only gluon fusion mechanism (\(gg\to...\to Z^{0}\to L^{+}L^{-}\)) is presented.

Figure 20: Heavy lepton pair production cross section \(M_{L}\) dependence for \(Q^{2}=E_{CM}^{2}\) and \(Q^{2}=p_{T}^{2}+m_{L}^{2}\), and \(M_{Z^{\prime}}=0.7~{}TeV/c^{2}\). Both Drell-Yan and gluon fusion mechanisms were considered.

Figure 21: Heavy lepton pair production cross section \(M_{L}\) dependence for \(Q^{2}=E_{CM}^{2}\) and \(Q^{2}=p_{T}^{2}+m_{L}^{2}\), and \(M_{Z^{\prime}}=2.0~{}TeV/c^{2}\). Both Drell-Yan and gluon fusion mechanisms were considered.

Figure 22: Signal significance \(M_{L}\) dependence for \(Q^{2}=E_{CM}^{2}\) and \(Q^{2}=p_{T}^{2}+m_{L}^{2}\). Only \(L^{\pm}\rightarrow\mu^{\pm}+Z^{0}\) channel is presented.

Figure 23: Signal significance \(M_{L}\) dependence for \(Q^{2}=E_{CM}^{2}\) and \(Q^{2}=p_{T}^{2}+m_{L}^{2}\). Only \(L^{\pm}\rightarrow\mu^{\pm}+Z^{0}\) channel is presented.
