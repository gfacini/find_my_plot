A detailed study of the associated Standard Model Higgs boson production in 14 TeV pp (LHC) and 2 TeV \(\rm p\bar{p}\) (Tevatron) collisions, WH with \(\rm W\to\ell\nu\) and ZH with \(\rm Z\to\ell\ell\), with Higgs boson decays to \(\rm b\bar{b}\) pair, is presented for Higgs masses of 100 and 120 GeV.

Presently, WH with \(\rm H\to b\bar{b}\) production is considered to be less promising than the \(\rm t\bar{t}\) associated production for Higgs searches at LHC [1]. However, studies of Higgs searches scenarios at the Tevatron [2], indicate that this channel in combination with the WH/ZH channels leading to the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}+b\bar{b}\) signature, offers good discovery potential in the mass range 90-140 GeV.

The aim of this paper is to provide several details which lead to a quantitative comparison in a consistent framework of the physics potential for these channels in both colliding scenarios. The emphasis is put on the differences in the expected signal and background rates and compositions of the backgrounds.

Introduction

If the mass of the Standard Model Higgs boson is lighter than \(2m_{\,W}\), the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) decay mode is dominant with a branching ratio of \(\sim 90\%\). The observation of such a characteristic signature would be important for both the Higgs boson discovery and for the determination of the nature of any resonance observed in this mass region. Since the direct production, \(\mathrm{g}\mathrm{g}\to\mathrm{H}\) with \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\), cannot be efficiently triggered nor extracted above the huge QCD two-jet background, the associated production with a W- or Z-boson or a \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\) pair remains as the only possible way to observe a signal from \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) decays. The leptonic decays of the W- or Z-boson provide an isolated high-\(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}\) lepton for triggering and for rejection against the QCD background. The Higgs boson signal will be reconstructed as a peak in the invariant mass spectrum of tagged b-jets.

Prospects for the observability of the WH channel leading to the \(\ell\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) signature, which is revisited in this paper, have already been considered in several documents of the ATLAS Collaboration [1, 3, 4]. It has been emphasised there that the expected sensitivity is rather weak, below \(3\sigma\), for an integrated luminosity of \(30\) fb\({}^{-1}\), for a Higgs mass in the range \(100\) - \(120\) GeV. The background to this signature is a mixture of the resonant WZ background, continuum backgrounds from \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\), \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) and from the reducible Wjj background. The extraction of the signal itself will be very difficult given the presence of the resonant WZ background, the magnitude of the continuum background and the uncertainity related to the knowledge of its shape.

ZH production has not been considered in details so far by the ATLAS Collaboration for the reasons explained in [1]. With \(\mathrm{Z}\to\ell\ell\) decay leading to the \(\ell\ell\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) signature, it would provide initial rates about six times lower than the WH channel and the signal-to-background ratio is not expected to be significantly lower with respect to that channel.

Given the fact that neither of these channels are considered as discovery channels at LHC, an attempt has been made to understand the reasons why they are claimed promising at the upgraded Tevatron [2]. Although some clear advantages come from the reduced center-of-mass energy (more central events than at LHC, much smaller \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\) cross-section), the expected rates should be substantially lower at the Tevatron than at the LHC for the same integrated luminosity.

In this paper, WH/ZH production, giving rice to final states with accompanying two b-jets, is revisited once again for the LHC environment and for mass values \(\mathrm{m}_{\,H}=\)100 GeV and 120 GeV. Then, a detailed comparison of the 2 TeV \(\mathrm{p}\bar{\mathrm{p}}\) scenario versus the 14 TeV \(\mathrm{p}\bar{\mathrm{p}}\) scenario is presented. An attempt is also made to break down, for the signal and the dominant backgrounds, the differences between the acceptances reported in [2] and those obtained in this study.

Similar studies for ZH/WH production with the final state signature of b-jets plus missing energy are presented in [5].

Observability of the \(\ell\)bb final state

### Expected production rates

Table 1 shows the production cross-sections of the signal and the backgrounds for pp collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV and \(\mathrm{p\bar{p}}\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=2\) TeV as calculated with PYTHIA 5.7 and CTEQ2L structure functions. The \(\mathrm{H},\mathrm{Z}\to\mathrm{b\bar{b}}\) and \(\mathrm{W}\to\ell\nu(\ell=\mathrm{e},\mu)\) branching ratios are included. The cross-sections for the W+jet production are quoted for the hard processes \(\mathrm{q\bar{q}}\to\mathrm{Wg}\) and \(\mathrm{qg}\to\mathrm{Wq}\), generated with the transverse momenta in the specified ranges.

The dominant uncertainties on the expected rates arise from higher-order corrections and from structure functions parametrisation. The expected cross-sections differ by no more than \(20\,\%\) if CTEQ2L or CTEQ4L structure functions are used. A large uncertainty is expected for the estimated cross-section of the Wjj final state, due to the known limitations of the parton shower approach for the simulation of multi-jet final states.

For 14 TeV pp collision the expected rates for the signal and the resonant background are higher by a factor of 10 while for single and double \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) production by a factor 80-90. The ratio of the cross-sections for W+jet rises with the threshold on the transverse momenta of the hard process, varying from \(\sim 10\) for \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{hard}=10-30}\) GeV to \(\sim 120\) for \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{hard}>200}\) GeV.

The Monte-Carlo statistics used in this study is rather high: typically \(5\cdot 10^{5}\) events were simulated for each of the background processes while for the W+jet process samples of \(5\cdot 10^{6}\) events were simulated in each \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{hard}}\) range.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \hline  & pp at 14 TeV & \(\mathrm{p\bar{p}}\) at 2 TeV & Ratio \\ Process & \(\sigma[pb]\) & \(\sigma[pb]\) & \\ \hline \hline WH, \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\ =\ 100\) GeV & 0.40 & 0.042 & 10 \\ WH, \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\ =\ 120\) GeV & 0.21 & 0.020 & 10 \\ \hline \hline WZ & 0.86 & 0.083 & 10 \\ \hline \(\mathrm{q\bar{q}}\to\mathrm{W^{*}}\to\mathrm{tb}\) & 1.0 & 0.11 & 10 \\ \hline \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) & 228 & 2.62 & 87 \\ \hline \(\mathrm{qg}\to\mathrm{tq}\) & 44.4 & 0.56 & 78 \\ \hline \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{W+jet} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \\ \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{hard}}=10-30\) GeV & \(1.1\cdot 10^{4}\) & \(9.7\cdot 10^{2}\) & 11 \\ \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{hard}}=30-50\) GeV & \(2.7\cdot 10^{3}\) & \(1.7\cdot 10^{2}\) & 16 \\ \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{hard}}=50-100\) GeV & \(1.5\cdot 10^{3}\) & \(7.4\cdot 10^{1}\) & 20 \\ \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{hard}}=100-200\) GeV & \(3.2\cdot 10^{2}\) & \(8.3\cdot 10^{0}\) & 38 \\ \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{hard}>200}\) GeV & \(3.5\cdot 10^{1}\) & \(0.3\cdot 10^{0}\) & 117 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Simulation procedure and selection criteria

The signal final state consists of a lepton from W decay, which triggers the experiment, and a pair of b-tagged jets which gives a peak in the invariant mass distribution.

The main ingredients of the reconstruction and selection procedure are:

* Efficiency for the lepton reconstruction, isolation and \(\rm p_{T}\) threshold.
* Jet reconstruction efficiency, threshold on the jet transverse momenta and expected jet-jet mass resolution.
* Jet-veto efficiency and threshold on the transverse momenta.
* Efficiency for b-jets tagging and non b-jets rejection.

The generated events, including QCD initial and final state radiation, fragmentation, hadronisation and decays, were simulated with a fast simulation of the ATLAS detector [6]. The following selection procedure was used:

* Electrons and muons were required to have transverse momenta 20 GeV and to be in the pseudorapidity region \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.5\). A 90% efficiency for lepton reconstruction was assumed. The isolation criteria are satisfied by most of the leptons from W decays. Events with a second lepton with \(\rm p_{T}~{}>~{}6\) GeV and \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.5\) were rejected. This selection reduces to a negligible level the Zjj and Zbb backgrounds and rejects also part of the \(\rm t\overline{t}\) background.
* Jets were reconstructed in a cone2 of \(\rm\Delta R=0.4\) and were required to have transverse momenta above 10 GeV. The reconstruction threshold for the fast simulation was defined at 5 GeV for 100% efficient reconstruction of the calorimetric energy depositions at 10 GeV after applying a gaussian smearing with a \(\rm 50\%/\sqrt{E}\) energy resolution [7]. This corresponds to a 15-18 GeV threshold on the recalibrated jet energies. Footnote 2: As this channel is considered primarily at low luminosity a reconstruction cone of \(\rm\Delta R~{}=~{}0.7\) might be more optimal.
* b-tagging capability will be possible in ATLAS in the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.5\). A b-tagging efficiency of 60% for b-labelled jets with rejection against c-jets of 10 and against light jets of 100 is assumed [8]. The impact of the \(\rm p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) dependence of the non-b-jets rejection for a constant b-tagging efficiency has been studied, [14], and has been shown to be small in terms of signal significance and signal-to-background ratio.
* Events with additional jets in the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|~{}<~{}5.0\) and \(\rm p_{T}~{}>~{}15\) GeV or \(\rm p_{T}~{}>~{}30\) GeV are rejected.

After calorimeter reconstruction, the peak position of the \(\rm m_{bb}\) distribution for the resonant WH and WZ events is shifted systematically by \(\sim\) 20 GeV towards lower values. The mass resolution is \(\sim\) 10%. To calibrate the jet energy scale a rather simple procedure is adopted to recover the out-of-cone energy loss due to fragmentation and hadronisation effects and to the expected response of the detector. Only jet energy scale is calibrated without additional tuning of the mass energy scale. With the simplified procedure applied here, a precision of 1-2 % on the reconstructed mass energy scale is achieved over the mass range 80-140 GeV and a precision of better than 5% for the mass region down to 40 GeV. This was obtained with fast simulation and for both non-b and b-jets. Such precision is adequate for the purpose of the studies presented here and allows control of the background shape well outside the mass region of the Higgs peak. Fig. 1 shows, the \(\rm(p_{T}^{b-jet}/p_{T}^{b-quark})\) distribution, after applying the recalibration procedure, for the signal sample of \(\rm H\to b\bar{b}\) events with \(\rm m_{H}=100\) GeV and the calibration factor applied to b-jets and to light jets after reconstruction with the fast simulation.

The final acceptance is sensitive to the threshold on the relatively tight jet veto which has to be imposed to suppress the \(\rm t\bar{t}\) background. Results are presented for two threshold values, 15 GeV and 30 GeV, both giving comparable signal significances with however different signal-to-background ratios and fractional background composition. Further optimisation of the thresholds for jet reconstruction and jet veto would be realistic only if performed with the full simulation of the detector and if complemented by more detailed studies of the Monte Carlo modeling of the hadronic activity in the event.

### Signal and backgrounds in 14 TeV pp collisions

#### 2.3.1 WH signal and WZ resonant background

Two mass points were simulated for the Higgs signal, m\({}_{\rm H}\)\(=100\) GeV and 120 GeV. Table 2 shows the expected cumulative acceptances for the kinematic selection criteria for the signal and the resonant background. Since the resolution obtained from the fast simulation is around 10% m\({}_{\rm H}\), 100 \(\pm\) 20 GeV and 120 \(\pm\) 24 GeV mass windows were chosen to estimate the expected number of signal and background events for Higgs masses of 100 and 120 GeV respectively. The acceptances in the mass windows are given in Table 3 for the signal events and for the resonant background. Finally, the expected number of events for an integrated luminosity of 30 \(fb^{-1}\) is given in Table 4.

The acceptance in the mass window 100 \(\pm\) 20 GeV is of 85% for WH signal events and 73% for the resonant WZ background. This can be considered as realistic, as an acceptance of 82% in the mass window 100 \(\pm\) 20 GeV was obtained for signal events with full simulation [1] and for the selection without jet veto. Jet veto leads to a better acceptance inside the mass window, since events with abundant radiation do not pass this selection.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \hline Cumulative & WH & WH & WZ \\ acceptance & m\({}_{\rm H}\) = 100 GeV & m\({}_{\rm H}\) = 120 GeV & m\({}_{\rm Z}\) = 91 GeV \\ \hline \hline Lepton & 63.2\% & 66.0\% & 57.9\% \\ \hline + 2 b-labelled jets & 29.3\% & 33.1\% & 21.3 \% \\ \hline + Jet veto 30 GeV & 18.5\% & 18.8\% & 13.9 \% \\ \hline + Jet veto 15 GeV & 10.5\% & 10.6\% & 7.9 \% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: _For the WH signal and WZ background events, expected cumulative acceptances of the kinematic selection criteria. Lepton reconstruction and b-tagging efficiencies are not included._

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \hline Acceptance & WH & WH & WZ \\ in mass window & m\({}_{\rm H}\) = 100 GeV & m\({}_{\rm H}\) = 120 GeV & m\({}_{\rm Z}\) = 91 GeV \\ \hline \hline  & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Jet veto 30 GeV} \\ \hline m\({}_{\rm bb}\) = 100\(\pm\) 20 GeV & 84\% & — & 73\% \\ \hline m\({}_{\rm bb}\) = 120\(\pm\) 24 GeV & — & 85\% & 28\% \\ \hline  & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Jet veto 15 GeV} \\ \hline m\({}_{\rm bb}\) = 100\(\pm\) 20 GeV & 89\% & — & 78\% \\ \hline m\({}_{\rm bb}\) = 120\(\pm\) 24 GeV & — & 90\% & 31\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: _Acceptances in the respective mass windows (see text)._The kinematical acceptance for the resonant WZ channel is somewhat lower than for the WH signal and obviously lower is the acceptance in the respective mass windows. Nevertheless, the expected number of events from WZ production inside the mass windows is 40% higher than from the signal itself for \(\rm m_{H}=100\) GeV and is comparable for \(\rm m_{H}=120\) GeV. In practice, the presence of a signal will broaden and distort the resonant peak from WZ events expected above a continuum background, as shown in Fig. 2. In the region close to the mass of the Z, the capability of extracting the signal peak would therefore relay on the knowledge of the WZ contribution which will be based on MC and data (e.g. \(\rm WZ\to\ell\nu\ell\ell\)).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \hline Expected & WH & WH & WZ \\ events & \(\rm m_{H}\) = 100 GeV & \(\rm m_{H}\) = 120 GeV & \(\rm m_{Z}\) = 91 GeV \\ \hline \hline  & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Jet veto 30 GeV} \\ \hline \(\rm m_{bb}\) = 100\(\pm\)20 GeV & 605 & — & 845 \\ \hline \(\rm m_{bb}\) = 120\(\pm\)25 GeV & — & 325 & 325 \\ \hline  & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Jet veto 15 GeV} \\ \hline \(\rm m_{bb}\) = 100\(\pm\)20 GeV & 360 & — & 520 \\ \hline \(\rm m_{bb}\) = 120\(\pm\)25 GeV & — & 195 & 207 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: _For an integrated luminosity of \(30\) fb\({}^{-1}\), expected number of events from the WH signal and the WZ resonant background after all cuts, including lepton reconstruction efficiency and b-tagging efficiencies._

For Higgs masses above 100 GeV an asymmetric mass window would be more appropriate, as the contribution from the WZ background raises very fast when the lower bound of the mass window is moved below \(\sim 100\) GeV.

#### 2.3.2 Continuum background

\(\bullet\)**Wjj background**

This background was simulated with the PYTHIA Monte Carlo, where jets in the final state come from the parton shower. The generation consisted of the tree level hard processes, \(\mathrm{q}\overline{\mathrm{q}}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{g}\) and \(\mathrm{g}\mathrm{q}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{q}\), accompanied by the initial and final state radiation. The total cross-section for W+jet events with \(p_{T}^{hard}~{}>~{}10\) GeV is 15 500 pb.

The contribution from the process \(\mathrm{q}\overline{\mathrm{q}}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{g}\) to the continuum irreducible \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) background was also obtained from the exact matrix element (ME) calculations [9] implemented into the HERWIG Monte Carlo (the same code as in [3] is used). The expected 3 cross-section times branching ratio for the \(\ell\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) final state is 39.6 pb.

Footnote 3: For the \(q\overline{q}\to W\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) process the cross-section is lower than what was given in [3]. This difference comes from the fact that in Table 1 of [3] the total \(\mathrm{p}\mathrm{p}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) cross-section was given and a factor 1.75 was applied to the \(q\overline{q}\to Wg\to W\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) cross-section to account for the \(gq\to Wq\) contribution.

Table 5 shows the kinematic acceptance for inclusive \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{jj}\) events (both \(\mathrm{q}\overline{\mathrm{q}}\) and \(\mathrm{q}\mathrm{g}\) contributions included) and separately for \(\mathrm{q}\overline{\mathrm{q}}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{g}\) events only. The acceptances are comparable in both samples. The heavy flavour composition of events accepted inside the mass window is given in Table 6. This composition is process dependent and is given for the inclusive \(\mathrm{q}\overline{\mathrm{q}}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{g}\), \(\mathrm{q}\mathrm{g}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{q}\) sample and for each subsample separately. It is found to be in good agreement with theoretical expectations discussed in [11]. A significantly lower fraction of \(cj,bc,cc\) and a higher fraction of \(b\overline{b}\) events is found in the \(q\overline{q}\to Wg\) sample than in the \(gq\to Wq\) sample. It should be stressed however that the statistical error on the numbers given in Table 6 is quite large in some cases.

Direct comparison of the \(q\overline{q}\to Wg\) process simulated with the ME calculations and with PYTHIA shower approach indicates that the predictions from PYTHIA are 20-30% lower. As the \(q\overline{q}\to W\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) matrix element for \(2\to 3\) process is fairly simple it should be well reproduced by the \(2\to 2\) process followed by gluon splitting. Nevertheless, this 20-30% discrepancy is much smaller than that obtained from e.g. comparing rates [12] for inclusive W+2jets and W+3jets production as given by PYTHIA and the VECBOS ME Monte Carlo. In these cases, a factor of 1.8-2.0 is needed to raise the PYTHIA prediction to that given by the matrix element calculations. In the \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) case, however, the \(\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) pair comes predominantly from gluon splitting of the leading gluon produced in the hard process \(q\overline{q}\to Wg\). In addition, other possible effects like softer multi-jet spectrum and/or enhanced heavy flavour content (for a discussion see [13]) could cancel each other, leading to a relatively small correction factor needed to bring the PYTHIA prediction for the \(q\overline{q}\to Wg\to Wbb\) background to agreement with the ME calculations.

The production cross-section for the \(q\overline{q}\to Wg\) process is 40% of the total \(pp~{}\to Wq\), \(Wg\) cross-section. On average, this 40% contribution holds also for the \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) events selected after cuts. However, for any other flavour composition of jets the \(q\overline{q}\) process contributes only 10 - 20% to the total number of expected events.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \hline Fraction & \(\rm q\bar{q}\to Wg\), \(\rm qg\to Wq\) & \(\rm q\bar{q}\to Wg\) & \(\rm qg\to Wq\) \\ in mass window & & & \\ \hline \hline bb & 0.3\% & 0.5\% & 0.2\% \\ bc & 0.2\% & 0.2\% & 0.3\% \\ cc & 1.4\% & 0.8\% & 1.8\% \\ jb & 1.5\% & 1.5\% & 1.5\% \\ jc & 18.6\% & 10.7\% & 20.0\% \\ jj & 78.0\% & 86.3\% & 76.2\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

For events generated with PYTHIA, these acceptances are given for samples generated at different bins and for events filtered by requiring 2 jets with \(|\eta|<2.5\)._For the final estimate of the Wjj background, results obtained from PYTHIA are used without any corrections to the overall normalisation 4.

Footnote 4: Somewhat different approach was followed in [3] for the evaluation of the Wb\(\bar{b}\) background. The ME+HERWIG prediction for \(q\overline{q}\to Wb\overline{b}\) was used and the resulting cross-section was then multiplied by a factor 1.75 to take into account the contribution from the \(\mathrm{g}\mathrm{q}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{q}\) process.

\(\bullet\)**Top pair \(\mathbf{a}\) and single top continuum background**

Top pair production contributes significantly to the continuum background. A non negligible background comes also from single top production. These backgrounds can be largely suppressed with a tight jet veto.

\(\rightarrow\)**Top pair production**

This channel results in a WWbb final state, with one W decaying into leptons and the other W decaying into leptons or jets. The lepton and jet vetos provide an overall rejection of \(\sim 100\) against this channel (for a jet veto at 15 GeV), see Table 9. As already discussed in [3] a large fraction of the remaining background comes from \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\tau\nu\) events. This channel represents the second dominant source of background after Wjj. The expected number of events is given in Table 10.

\(\rightarrow\)**Single top production: \(\mathrm{W^{*}}\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{t}\mathrm{b}\)**

Another source of irreducible Wbb background is a direct production of a off-mass shell \(\mathrm{W^{*}}\rightarrow\mathrm{t}\mathrm{b}\). In this case the HERWIG 5.6 Monte Carlo generator has been used, since this process is not available in PYTHIA. This channel has a production cross-section almost two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the inclusive \(\mathrm{q}\overline{\mathrm{q}}\rightarrow\mathrm{W}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{ \bar{b}}\) background. Although its acceptance is almost 3-5 times larger than that of Wbb, it only increases the \(\mathrm{q}\overline{\mathrm{q}}\rightarrow\mathrm{W}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{ \bar{b}}\) background by \(\sim 10\)-\(20\%\). The expected acceptances of the kinematic selection are given in Table 9, and the expected number of events after all cuts in Table 10.

\(\rightarrow\)**Single top production: \(\mathrm{t}\mathrm{b}\), \(\mathrm{t}\mathrm{c}\)**

The acceptance for the \(b\)-jets selection for single top production is relatively low, in Table 9 it is denoted as filtered, and that required the \(qg\to tq\) process to be generated in several \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\). In addition, an extra jet in the final state can be efficiently tagged, leading to a large rejection by the jet veto. The background from the continuum single top production turns out therefore to be significantly smaller than that from \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) production.

#### 2.3.3 Total signal and background

Tables 11 and 12 present the expected rates after all cuts for an integrated luminosity of \(30fb^{-1}\) for the WH signal with \(\rm m_{H}=100\) GeV and 120 GeV and for the backgrounds. Results are given for two thresholds on the jet veto, 15 GeV and 30 GeV. Lepton reconstruction efficiency, b-tagging efficiency and mass window acceptance have been included.

Neither the signal nor the backgrounds were rescaled to take into account higher-order corrections or limitations coming from the parton shower approach. In particular, the contribution from \(\rm Wb\bar{b}\) events was taken from PYTHIA.

So far only events where \(\rm W\to e\nu\) or \(\rm W\to\mu\nu\) were considered both for the signal and the backgrounds. Events giving rise to \(\ell\rm b\bar{b}\) final states could come also from WH, ZH events with \(\rm W\to\tau\nu\), \(\rm Z\to\ell\ell\) or \(\rm Z\to\tau\tau\) for the signal from ZZ, \(\rm Z+jet\) for the background. The total signal rates can be increased by 13%, the irreducible resonant background by 20% while the non resonant background can be increased by up to 13% of the contribution coming from events with \(\rm W\to e\nu\), \(\mu\nu\) only. These might lead to an improvement in the expected significance by at most 6%.

Table 9: _For the single top and top pair production, the expected cumulative acceptances of the kinematic selection criteria. For tb, \(tc\) events the acceptances are given for events previously filtered by requiring two b- or c- jets._The general conclusions which can be driven from these results are:

* The expected signal significance, measured as \(\,{\rm S/\sqrt{B}}\), varies between 3.8 and 3.5 for \(\,{\rm m_{H}}\,=100\) GeV, and between 2.1-2.0 for \(\,{\rm m_{H}}\,=120\) GeV, depending on the jet veto threshold.
* The signal-to-background ratio is below 4% and the ratio of the reducible-to-irreducible background varies between 20-30%.
* A jet veto of 15-30 GeV is crucial to suppress the otherwise overwhelming \(\rm t\bar{t}\) background. Therefore this channel is expected to be difficult at high luminosity.
* The observation of the resonant WZ peak seems possible with a significance exceeding 5\(\sigma\) for an integrated luminosity of 30 \(fb^{-1}\).

### 2 TeV p\(\bar{\rm p}\) versus 14 TeV pp

#### 2.4.1 Introduction

The primary aim of this comparison is to study differences in the expected signal and background for 14 TeV pp and 2 TeV p\(\bar{\rm p}\) collisions, assuming comparable performance of the detectors, namely efficiencies for jets and lepton reconstruction, b-jet tagging and jet veto. In both scenarios the fast simulation of the ATLAS detector is used.

The following selection criteria are adopted:

* For the cases called (1) and (2) the ATLAS rapidity coverage and selection criteria are used with a jet-veto threshold at 30 GeV. Differences in the acceptances and expected rates are therefore directly related to differences in the physics (cross-sections and kinematic features of events, etc.).
* For the case called (3) a reduced geometrical coverage and slightly different selection criteria are used, following what specified in the Tevatron report [2]:
* one lepton with p\({}_{\rm T}\ >\ 20\) GeV, no other leptons with p\({}_{\rm T}\ >\ 10\) GeV;
* the detector coverage for b-tagging and lepton reconstruction is \(|\eta|\ <\ 2.0\);
* events with additional jets over \(|\eta|\ <\ 2.5\) and p\({}_{\rm T}\ >\ 30\) GeV are rejected.
* For the b-tagging performance a 60% efficiency per b-labelled jet, for a rejection of 10 per c-labelled jet and 100 against light jet is assumed.
* A lepton reconstruction efficiency of 90% is assumed for electrons and muons.
* A mass window of \(\pm 2\sigma\) with \(\sigma\ =\ 10\%\) m\({}_{\rm H}\) is used.

#### 2.4.2 WH signal and W Z resonant background

The acceptance for signal events is higher almost by a factor of two for 2 TeV p\(\bar{\rm p}\) collisions than for 14 TeV pp collisions. About 16% higher acceptance is expected for the request of an isolated lepton, about 19% for the request of a b-labelled pair and about 30% for the jet veto. The higher acceptance for the jet veto cut is caused mostly by the weaker QCD radiation at smaller centre-of-mass energy. The smaller geometrical acceptance of the Tevatron detectors is compensated by a softer jet-veto cut, as the tt background is much less severe at 2 TeV.

Due to the smaller acceptance at 14 TeV, expected signal rates are only by 5.3 - 5.5 times higher than at 2 TeV, despite the fact that the initial cross-section is 10 times larger. Similarly, the acceptance for the resonant background is 2 times higher for 2 TeV p\(\bar{\rm p}\) collisions. About 17% higher acceptance is expected for the request of an isolated lepton, about 23% for the request of a b-labelled pair and about 28% for the jet-veto cut. Also in this case the higher acceptance for the jet veto is caused mostly by the smaller center-of-mass energy.

#### 2.4.3 Continuum background

The total continuum background is 17 times higher in the 14 TeV pp scenario.

\(\bullet\)**Wjj background**

As above the total acceptances for the kinematic cuts (see Table 15) is smaller in the 14 TeV pp scenario. In this particular case the total acceptance is lower by a factor 1.6.

The total rate from Wjj events after all cuts is 17-21 higher at LHC. The relative contribution from the reducible background Wjj(other) is 40% for 14 TeV pp collisions and 20% for 2 TeV pp collisions.

\(\bullet\)**W\({}^{*}\rightarrow\)tb background**

This background is of little importance in both scenarios. The total acceptance is smaller at LHC but the expected rates are 4.7 times higher.

\(\bullet\)**t\(\overline{\mbox{t}}\) background**

The \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mbox{t}}\) background is significantly smaller at 2 TeV because the cross section is almost 100 times smaller. This background is strongly suppressed with the jet veto cut. At 2 TeV such a jet veto is almost a factor of 3 less efficient because of the QCD radiation and the jet-veto threshold (case 3) is slightly softer. The resulting acceptance is almost 2 times smaller at LHC and therefore the expected background rates 33 times larger.

\(\bullet\)**tb,tc background**

Similar observations as for the \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mbox{t}}\) channel are also valid in this case. The overall acceptance is 3 times smaller at LHC, but the absolute event rate is 18 - 25 times higher.

Figure 4: _The expected \(\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{bb}}\) spectrum for WH (hatched), WZ (dashed) and WH+WZ (solid) events for a Higgs mass \(\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{H}}\) = 100 GeV (left) and 120 GeV (right)._

#### 2.4.4 Total signal and background

Tables 16 and 17 compare the expected signal and background rates for the 14 TeV pp scenario and the 2 TeV \(\rm p\bar{p}\) scenario for two mass points, \(\rm m_{H}=100\) GeV and 1 20 GeV, and for a jet veto cut of 30 GeV. Assuming the same detector performance, the signal and resonant background are a factor of 5 larger at LHC and the continuum background a factor of 20 larger. The ratio of reducible to irreducible background is a factor 1.6 - 1.9 higher at LHC and the signal to background a factor 3 - 5 smaller.

The sensitivity in terms of \(\rm S/\sqrt{B}\) is 1.3 times larger at LHC, however the environment is much more difficult. The background is not dominated by a single source, but is a combination of \(\rm Wb\bar{b}\) and \(\rm t\bar{t}\) events and a substantial contribution from the reducible Wjj. The ratio of the reducible to irreducible background is larger therefore a very good rejection of non-b jets is important. The \(\rm t\bar{t}\) background is potentially overwhelming and can be suppressed only with very tight jet veto cuts. The feasibility and the efficiency of a tight jet veto is crucial for the observation of this channel.

#### 2.4.5 Comparison with the Tevatron report [2]

The results presented in the previous sections can be directly compared with those p-resented in [2]. Therefore we consider them to be mature enough to justify performed below comparison. Two different analyses are presented in [2], based on the so called _QFL_ and _SHW_ simulations of the detector performance. The proposed selection criteria differ in some details between these two analyses, leading however to comparable signal significances in both cases.

In Tables 18 - 21 comparisons between the results obtained with these studies and those reported in [2] are shown for mass point \(\rm m_{H}=110\) GeV 5. There are obvious differences in the assumptions concerning the expected detector performance. In the column labelled _This study_, the performance of the ATLAS detector at LHC is assumed, but the selection criteria are those proposed in [2]. These include a reduced pseudorapidity coverage and a softer jet veto, as already explained in Section 2.4.1 (case 3). In addition to the selection criteria described so far, a cut on the transverse missing energy, \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}>20\) GeV is included 6 because it is used in the analysis presented in [2].

Footnote 5: Only for this mass point a complete break-down of the acceptance for signal and backgrounds is available in [2].

Footnote 6: This selection is used to suppress the possible background due to semileptonic decays inside QCD jets.

The main ingredients of the detector performance, which are relevant for these Higgs searches are the b-tagging efficiency and the non-b jets rejection, as well as the efficiencies for jet reconstruction and jet veto. The column _This study scaled_ shows results obtained by using7 the same acceptance for double b-tag for the signal events as quoted in[2]. The background rates in this column are scaled with the same factor as for the signal.

Footnote 7: We could not used directly parametrisation for the b-tagging efficiency given in [2], as the information on the reconstruction efficiency for b-labelled pair was not available there.

**Comparison with the SHW analysis**

Selection criteria as close as possible to those of the SHW analysis have been applied in _This study_ :

* _Lepton cut:_ One isolated lepton with \(\rm p_{T}~{}>~{}20\) GeV and no additional lepton with \(\rm p_{T}~{}>~{}10\) GeV, inside the rapidity coverage \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.0\).
* \(E_{T}^{miss}\) _cut:_ The reconstructed missing transverse energy must be \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}~{}>~{}20\) GeV. The calorimeter coverage extends up to 5.0 in pseudorapidity.
* _Double b-tag cut:_ Two jets with \(\rm p_{T}~{}>~{}30\) GeV and 15 GeV respectively within \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.0\) tagged as b-jets. A b-tagging efficiency of 60% per jet was used, with a rejection against c-jets of 10 and a rejection against light jets of 100. For _This study scaled_, the efficiency for double b-tag (including the jet reconstruction efficiency is multiplied for both signal and background by a correction factor of 1.7.
* _Jet-veto cut:_ Jets are reconstructed in the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.5\). No jets with \(\rm p_{T}~{}>~{}30\) GeV and not more than one jet with \(\rm p_{T}~{}>~{}15\) GeV are required.
* _Mass window cut:_ A mass window of \(110\pm 33\) GeV, corresponding to \(\sigma=15\%\) m\({}_{H}\), is used.

The discrepancy between (A) and (B) is roughly consistent with a factor 1.7 higher acceptance for double b-tag (including jet reconstruction) in (B), a factor 0.75 lower acceptance for jet veto in (B) and factor 1.3 higher signal cross-section assumed in (B). After rescaling the rates for the double b-tag of the Tevatron study, the disagreement between (A') and (B) almost disappear, which is however rather accidental for the background.

A more detailed break-down of the differences between the two studies, which can be found below, supports these conclusions. It should also be stressed that, Table 5, 6 and 7 in Section C of [2] show some inconsistencies. In Tables 19 and 20, which give the break-down of acceptances, we quote the number of events estimated from the cross-sections (Table 5 of [2]) and acceptances (Table 6 of [2]). These are not always consistent with what could be retrieved from Table 7 of [2]. As an example, the \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) background estimate from Table 7 of [2] is 900 events while that from Tables 5 and 6 of [2] is 360 events.

**Comparison with the QFL analysis**

Selection criteria as close as possible to those of the QFL's analysis [2] have been applied in _This study_:

* _Lepton cut:_ One isolated lepton with \(\rm p_{T}~{}>~{}20\) GeV and no additional lepton with \(\rm p_{T}~{}>~{}10\) GeV, inside the rapidity coverage \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.0\). Note that the isolated tracks from hadronic tau-decays are not considered in (A), but are included in (B)).
* \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) _cut:_ The reconstructed missing transverse energy must be \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\)\(>20\) GeV. The calorimeter coverage extends up to 5.0 in pseudorapidity.
* The jet reconstruction threshold is set to 10 GeV.
* _Double b-tag cut:_ Two jets with \(\rm p_{T}>30\) GeV and 15 GeV respectively within \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.0\) tagged as _b_-jets. A _b_-tagging efficiency of 60% per jet was used, with a rejection against _c_-jets of 10 and a rejection against light jets of 100. For _This study scaled_, the efficiency for double _b_-tag (including the jet reconstruction efficiency) is multiplied for both signal and background by a correction factor of 1.3.
* _Jet-veto cut:_ Jets are reconstructed in the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|\)\(<\) 2.4. No jets with \(\rm p_{T}>20\) GeV.
* _Mass window cut:_ A mass window of \(110\pm 22\) GeV, corresponding to \(\sigma=10\%\)\(\rm m_{H}\), is used for (A) and (A'). Results in (B) are given for mass window 91.8-123.3 GeV.

One should notice, that the same number of signal events is expected from the \(SHW\) and \(QFL\) analyses, but the estimated backgrounds differ by a factor 2!

This channel is marginal for Higgs discovery at LHC. This is demonstrated by the study presented in this Section which are performed for a Higgs mass \(\rm m_{H}=100\) GeV.

The following selection criteria are applied:

* _2 leptons:_ two opposite-sign, same-flavour leptons (OS-SF leptons) satisfying the following requirements:
* one electron or muon with \(\rm p_{T}>20\) GeV or two electrons or muons with \(\rm p_{T}~{}>~{}15\) GeV inside \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.5\);
* the reconstructed di-lepton mass inside a mass window of \(\pm~{}6\) GeV around the \(Z\) mass. The lepton reconstruction efficiency is conservatively assumed to be 90% per lepton.
* _2 b-jets:_ 2 b-labelled jets with reconstructed transverse momenta \(\rm p_{T}~{}>~{}15\) GeV and \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.5\). A b-tagging efficiency of 60% with a rejection of 10 and 100 against c-jets and light-jets respectively is used.
* _Jet veto:_ events with additional jets with \(\rm p_{T}~{}>~{}30\) and \(|\eta|~{}<~{}5.0\) are rejected.
* _Mass window:_ it is chosen to be \(\rm 100~{}\pm~{}20\) GeV for \(\rm m_{H}=100\) GeV, which corresponds to the resolution of 10% \(\rm m_{H}\).

#### 3.2.2 Continuum background

Only Zjj and tt contribute significantly to the background to this channel:

\(\bullet\)**Top pair production**

This channel gives rise to \(\ell\ell b\bar{b}\) final states if both W's decay semileptonically. The acceptance for two OS-SF leptons with invariant mass within \(\pm\) 6 GeV of the Z mass is 2.6%. On the other hand the jet veto is much less efficient than for \(\ell b\bar{b}\) final states where the second W from the top-quark decays predominantly into hadrons. The total acceptance for tt production, normalised to a \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\rightarrow\ell\ell\nu\nu\)b\(\mathrm{\bar{b}}\) sample, is 0.3%. The total background from \(t\bar{t}\) events is a factor of 10-25 smaller, depending on the threshold of the jet veto, than for the \(\ell b\bar{b}\) channel.

\(\bullet\)**Zjj continuum background**

This background was simulated with PYTHIA where multi-jets arise from parton shower. In PYTHIA, the tree level processes \(qg\to qZ\) and \(q\bar{q}\to gZ\) are available. The cross-section is dominated by the first one. It does not include however all tree level diagrams leading to the \(Zb\bar{b}\) final state [15], namely the \(gg\to b\bar{b}Z\) process is missing. Such configuration can be obtained only through initial state radiation. Therefore the total \(Zb\bar{b}\) background, as given by PYTHIA is underestimated [15]. On the other hand, the reducible Zjj, where at least one jet is not a b can not be simulated with the exact matrix element from [15]. As in any case the ZH signal is a marginal one, this rather crude estimate of the Zjj background is hopefully sufficient for the evaluation presented below.

As a consequence of the fact that different hard processes contribute to \(Zjj\) and \(Wjj\) production, the jet flavour composition is very different in the two cases, as illustrated in Table 26. The fraction of \(Zb\bar{b}\) events in the inclusive \(Zjj\) sample is 2.3% while the fraction of \(\mathrm{Wb\bar{b}}\) events in the inclusive \(Wjj\) sample is only 0.3%. The main difference comes from the fact that \(\mathrm{qg}\rightarrow\mathrm{Zb}\) production comes from the process \(\mathrm{bg}\rightarrow\mathrm{Zb}\), which is accompanied in most cases by second spectator b-quark from the gluon splitting in the evolution of the structure functions. In this case a \(\mathrm{Zb\bar{b}}\) final state is quite easy to obtain. On the other hand \(\mathrm{qg}\rightarrow\mathrm{Wb}\) scattering is very rare, because it would require a top-quark in the initial state. As a consequence in the \(\mathrm{qg}\rightarrow\mathrm{Wq}\) process one observes enhancement of the cj fraction with respect to what observed in the \(\mathrm{qg}\rightarrow\mathrm{Zq}\) process. On the other hand, the flavour composition for the \(\mathrm{q\bar{q}}\rightarrow\mathrm{Zg}\) and \(\mathrm{q\bar{q}}\rightarrow\mathrm{Wg}\) processes is very similar, since in both cases the b\(\mathrm{\bar{b}}\) pair arises from gluon splitting.

As a consequence, after b-jets identification, the background from the Zjj channel is dominated by \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\mathrm{b\bar{b}}\) events with two real b (90% of the total Zjj background) while for the Wjj channel the \(\mathrm{Wb\bar{b}}\) contribution amounts only to 60% of the total Wjj background.

#### 3.2.3 Total signal and background

Table 28 presents the expected rates for the ZH signal and backgrounds giving \(\ell\ell b\overline{b}\) final states for an integrated luminosity of \(30\,fb^{-1}\). The efficiencies for lepton reconstruction and b-tagging have been included and a mass window of \(\pm\) 20 GeV around the nominal Higgs mass, \(\rm m_{H}=100\) GeV, is used. Neither the signal nor the backgrounds were rescaled to take into account higher order corrections or limitations coming from the parton shower approach.

The sensitivity of this channel is found to be marginal. Around 50 signal events over 4000 background events are expected. This gives statistical significances below 1\(\sigma\) and signal-to-background ratios of 1% only. The significance for the observation of the resonant ZZ+ZH peak is 3.5\(\sigma\). The ZH signal itself would contribute only 30% to the resonant peak in the \(\rm b\overline{b}\) mass window.

Given the fact that the dominant background is \(Zb\overline{b}\), which has been simulated with PYTHIA, the estimates for \(S/\sqrt{B}\) shown in Table 28 are on the optimistic side.

Figure 6 shows the expected \(m_{bb}\) distribution for the total background and for the signal plus background, for a jet veto threshold of 30 GeV. This Figure illustrates also that it will be hopeless to extract such a marginal signal given the shape and magnitude of the continuum background.

The expected sensitivity for the \(\ell\ell\rm b\overline{b}\) signature is much weaker than that for the \(\ell\rm b\overline{b}\) signature. For the selection with a jet veto at 30 GeV, the expected signal rates are 8 times lower while the background rates are only 3.5 times lower in the \(\ell\ell\rm b\overline{b}\) case as compared to the \(\ell\rm b\overline{b}\) case. This leads to a factor of \(\sim 4\) smaller statistical significance. Although in the case of the \(\ell\ell\rm b\overline{b}\) channel the jet veto can be relaxed or removed (the \(\rm t\overline{t}\) background is less severe) this would increase the signal and background rates by at most a factor of 2 and the statistical significance by at most 40%.

Also extracting a resonant ZZ peak in the \(\ell\ell\rm b\overline{b}\) channel would be more difficult than extracting a WZ peak in the \(\ell\rm b\overline{b}\) channel.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \hline Process & No jet veto & Jet veto 30 GeV & Jet veto 15 GeV \\ \hline \hline ZH & 115 & 80 & 45 \\ \hline ZZ & 230 & 160 & 100 \\ tt & 850 & 350 & 1 50 \\ Zjj (bb) & 8300 & 6300 & 3300 \\ Zjj (other) & 700 & 500 & 3 50 \\ \hline Total bgd & 10100 & 7300 & 3900 \\ \hline S/\(\sqrt{\rm B}\) & 1.1 & 0.9 & 0.7 \\ \hline S/B & 1.1 \% & 1.1\% & 1.1\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 28: _For an integrated luminosity of \(30\ fb^{-1}\), expected number of signal and background events after all cuts._As can be concluded from Table 28 the jet veto can be safely relaxed or abandoned since the \(\rm t\overline{t}\) background not exceed 10% of the total background. This should allow probing this channel also at high luminosity. However, even with the ultimate integrated luminosity of \(300\;fb^{-1}\) and a b-tagging efficiency of 50% the expected significance would be at the level of \(3.0\sigma\) only.

### 2 TeV \(\rm p\overline{p}\) versus 14 TeV pp

The \(\rm ZH\rightarrow\rightarrow\ell\ell b\overline{b}\) channel is considered non-marginal for Higgs discovery at the Tevatron [2]. To understand the differences in the expected physics potential for both colliding scenarios, a quantitative comparison has been performed and is presented below.

As in the previous studies for both colliding scenarios the ATLAS fast simulation is used.

The following selection criteria were used:

* We denote with (1) and (2) analyses based on the kinematical coverage of the ATLAS detector and on the selection criteria discussed in the previous sections. Differences in acceptances and expected rates are therefore directly related to the differences in physics.

Figure 6: _The expected \(\rm m_{bb}\) distribution for the signal and the resonant background (left) and for the total background and the signal plus background (right) for a jet veto threshold of 30 GeV and an integrated luminosity of \(30\;fb^{-1}\)._

* Results denoted with (3) were obtained with a geometrical coverage and selection criteria similar to those in [2].
* two leptons with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}~{}>~{}10\) GeV inside the rapidity range of \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.0\) and with invariant mass in the window \(\mathrm{m_{Z}}~{}\pm~{}6\) GeV.
* b-tagging and lepton reconstruction over \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.0\).
* no additional jets with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}~{}>~{}30\) GeV and no more than one jet with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}~{}>~{}15\) GeV within the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.5\).
* A b-tagging efficiency of 60% per b-labeled jet, with a rejection of 10 per c-jet and 100 per light-quark jet were used.
* A mass window of \(100\pm 20\) GeV was used.
* The lepton reconstruction efficiency is conservatively assumed to be 90% per lepton.

#### 3.3.1 ZH signal and resonant background

The signal acceptance is 80 % higher for the 2 TeV \(\mathrm{p\bar{p}}\) scenario. About 10% higher acceptance is expected from the request of a pair of isolated leptons, about 20 % for the request of a pair of b-labelled jets and about 40% for the jet veto cut. The higher acceptance of the jet veto cut is due mostly to the smaller center-of-mass energy resulting in a smaller QCD radiation. The smaller geometrical acceptance of the Tevatron detectors is compensated by the softer jet veto cut (as the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) background is much smaller at 2 TeV \(\mathrm{p\bar{p}}\)).

The smaller acceptance at LHC energies leads to expected signal rates which are only 5.7 times higher than at the Tevatron, despite the 10 times larger initial cross-section.

The acceptance for the resonant background is 10% higher for the pair of isolated leptons and 24% for the pair of b-labelled jets for 2 TeV. Since the jet veto is more efficient at 14 TeV the final acceptance is 70% higher at 2 TeV (see Table 29).

The expected rates after all cuts are given in Table 30. The resonant background is 6.9 times higher at 14 TeV. Since the signal is only a factor 5.7 higher at 14 TeV, the signal to resonant background ratio is worse at 14 TeV.

#### 3.3.3 Total signal and background

Table 30 compares the expected signal and backgrounds for the 14 TeV pp and the 2 TeV \(\mathrm{p\bar{p}}\) scenarios as obtained with and without jet veto. For instance, assuming a comparable detector performance and no jet veto, the expected signal is 5.3 times higher and the total background 36 times higher for 14 TeV pp case. The significances are comparable in both cases, but the signal-to-background ratio is much larger for the 2 TeV \(\mathrm{p\bar{p}}\) scenario.

The estimates presented in Table 34 show that the sensitivity to this channel is marginal for both scenarios. Also, in both cases the dominant background is \(\mathrm{Zb\bar{b}}\), which is underestimated in PYTHIA.

#### 3.3.4 Comparison with the Tevatron report [2]

A direct comparison with the results presented in [2] is shown in Table 35. There is a clear disagreement in the predicted signal and backgrounds. For the results presented in the column _This study_, the ATLAS performance is assumed, but the selection criteria proposed in [2] are used. This includes smaller pseudorapidity coverage and softer jet veto, as already discussed in Section 3.3. The column _This study scaled_ shows rates rescaled by a factor 1.7, obtained assuming the double b-tag acceptance for signal events as in the Tevatron study for the WH channel.

The discrepancy in the predicted signal rates is consistent with a factor of 2 higher acceptance for double b-tag (including jets reconstruction) and a factor 1.3 higher signal cross-section used by the Tevatron studies. Very significant is the discrepancy in the predicted rates for the dominant Zb\(\bar{\rm b}\) background. These are 3 times lower in the Tevatron study, even after taking into account the different double b-tag efficiency. A more detailed comparison is not possible for this channel as a break-down of the acceptances is not available in [2].

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c||c|c|} \hline \hline Process & This study & This study & Tevatron report & Ratio & Ratio \\  & (A) & scaled (A’) & (SHW study) (B) & (A)/(B) & (A’)/(B) \\ \hline \hline ZH & 15 & 25 & 36 & 0.4 & 0.7 \\ \hline ZZ & 23 & 40 & 63 & 0.4 & 0.6 \\ \hline tt & 11 & 20 & 57 & 0.2 & 0.3 \\ Zbb & 120 & 200 & 72 & 1.7 & 2.8 \\ Zjj (other) & 14 & 14 & none & **–** & **–** \\ \hline Total bgd & 170 & 275 & 192 & 0.9 & 1.4 \\ \hline S/\(\sqrt{\rm B}\) & 0.8 & 1.4 & 2.6 & 0.3 & 0.5 \\ \hline S/B & 6.5\% & 9.1\% & 18.7\% & 0.3 & 0.5 \\ \hline B\({}_{\rm o\,ther}\)/B\({}_{\rm total}\) & 8\% & 5\% & none & **–** & **–** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The primary aim of this paper was to understand the differences in the expected potential for the Higgs discovery in the WH/ZH, \(\mathrm{H\to b\bar{b}}\), \(\mathrm{W/Z\to lepton(s)}\) channels, for 2 TeV \(\mathrm{p\bar{p}}\) and 14 TeV pp collisions. The aim was also to quantify, if possible, the origin of the differences in the expected potential as estimated in [2] for 2 TeV \(\mathrm{p\bar{p}}\) collisions and in [1] for 14 TeV pp collisions.

As already stressed, the channel WH with \(\mathrm{H\to b\bar{b}}\) is not considered as a discovery channel at LHC.

It has been confirmed here that the overall sensitivity is below \(4\sigma\) for \(\mathrm{m_{H}=100}\) GeV and around \(2\sigma\) for \(\mathrm{m_{H}=120}\) GeV. This includes only the statistical errors and not possibly large systematic uncertainties coming from theoretical predictions and detector performance.

A detailed comparison of the expected signal and background for 14 TeV pp collision-s and 2 TeV \(\mathrm{p\bar{p}}\) collisions was presented assuming the same detector performance and ATLAS-like or Tevatron-like selection criteria. The results obtained in this study for the 2 TeV \(\mathrm{p\bar{p}}\) scenario are much less promising than those reported in [2]. A direct comparison performed for \(\mathrm{m_{H}=110}\) GeV shows that in [2] the signal rate is estimated to be 1.8 times higher and the background rates to be 1.7 times higher. This leads to 1.4 times larger \(\mathrm{S/\sqrt{B}}\).

The sensitivity to the \(\ell\ell b\bar{b}\) signature was evaluated here to be at the level of \(1\sigma\) only for an integrated luminosity of 30 \(fb^{-1}\) and for both the 14 TeV pp and 2 TeV \(\mathrm{p\bar{p}}\) cases. As the selection does not require a tight jet-veto cut this channel could also be studied at high luminosity with a loss of performance due only to the reduced b-tagging capability. However, even with the ultimate integrated luminosity of 300 \(fb^{-1}\) the expected sensitivity would not exceed 3.0\(\sigma\) at LHC. An additional difficulty comes from the fact that the expected signal is only at the level of 30 - 50% of the resonant background.

A direct comparison shows that for \(\ell\ell b\bar{b}\) final states the signal rates are estimated to be 2.4 times higher and the background rates 1.1 times larger in [2] than in the study shown here for 2 TeV \(\mathrm{p\bar{p}}\) collisions.
