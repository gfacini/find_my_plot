## 1 Introduction

The properties of the newly discovered Higgs boson have been extensively probed by the ATLAS and CMS experiments using LHC Run 1 proton-proton collision data at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) and 8 TeV [1, 2, 3, 4]. The studies of the tensor structure of the Higgs boson couplings to gauge bosons were based on signal models including at most one or two beyond-the-standard-model coupling parameters at a time, with all remaining Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) parameters set to zero. For Run 2, it is envisioned to have signal models which depend on a larger number of coupling parameters, in order to account for possible correlations among them. Additional coupling parameters in the Higgs coupling to Standard Model (SM) particles change the predicted cross section, as well as the shape of differential distributions. In this context, it is necessary to revise the existing signal modelling methods and provide alternatives which are better suited for such a multidimensional parameter space.

For this purpose, a morphing method has been developed and implemented. It provides a continuous description of arbitrary physical signal observables such as cross sections or differential distributions in a multidimensional space of coupling parameters. The morphing-based signal model is a linear combination of a minimal set of orthogonal base samples (templates) spanning the full coupling parameter space. The weight of each template is derived from the coupling parameters appearing in the signal matrix element.

Morphing is more than a simple interpolation technique, in that it is not limited to the points in the range spanned by the input samples. In fact, the choice of the input samples is arbitrary, and any set of input samples satisfying the required conditions to build the morphing function will span the entire space, independent of their precise coordinates.

This note is structured as follows. In Section 2, the morphing method will be introduced in detail and compared to the established approach of reweighing events according to re-computed matrix elements. The coupling parametrisation model used in Run 1 ATLAS analysis is presented in Section 3 to serve later as an example for validating the procedure.

The extraction of Higgs boson coupling parameters with a maximum likelihood fit using a model constructed by the morphing method is described in Section 4. The validation results are presented in Section 5. In Section 6 an example study which uses the morphing method to construct a signal model and extract parameters of interest is conducted. In this study the impact of various BSM parameters in the vector-boson-fusion (VBF) production vertex of the Higgs boson on various VBF-specific physical observables is studied. Finally, the conclusions are given in Section 7.

All studies in Sections 5 and 6 are on generator level only, with the exception of the morphing validation described in Section 5.2. This section uses the final discriminating distributions of the ATLAS Run 1 \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) tensor structure analysis [1] as input for the validation of the morphing technique. Backgrounds are explicitly not taken into account in the example studies.

Higher order QCD and EW corrections are not considered. In the presented work a single resonance with a mass of 125  GeV is assumed. The total width of the Higgs boson is fixed to the SM expectation of 4  MeV and a modification caused by the coupling parameters is not taken into account. For a correct modelling of the total width all coupling parameters of a model need to be considered, not only the parameters that enter in the Higgs boson production or decay. If all parameters that influence the total width are known, the morphing technique can be used to describe the dependence of the total width on the coupling parameters of a model.

## 2 Signal morphing and comparison to matrix element reweighting

### Morphing principles

The morphing procedure is based on the concepts of the morphing of (possibly multi-dimensional) histograms described in Reference [5]. It is introduced to describe the dependence of a given physical observable \(T\) on an arbitrary configuration of a set of non-SM Higgs boson couplings \(\vec{g}_{\text{target}}\equiv\{g_{\text{SM}},g_{\text{BSM}},1,..,g_{\text{BSM}},n\}\) to known particles. This dependence is described by a morphing function

\[T_{\text{out}}(\vec{g}_{\text{target}})=\sum_{i}w_{i}(\vec{g}_{\text{target}} ;\vec{g}_{i})T_{\text{in}}(\vec{g}_{i}), \tag{1}\]

which linearly combines the values or differential distributions \(T_{\text{in}}\) at a number of selected discrete coupling configurations \(\vec{g}_{i}=\{g_{\text{SM}},i,\vec{g}_{\text{BSM}},i\}\). The input distributions \(T_{\text{in}}\) are normalised to their expected cross sections such that \(T_{\text{out}}\) includes not only the correct shape, but also the correct cross section prediction. Here, \(g_{\text{SM}}\) denotes the Higgs boson coupling predicted by the Standard Model. Morphing only requires that any differential cross section can be expressed as a polynomial in coupling parameters. For calculation at lowest order and using the narrow-width approximation for a resonance, this yields a second order polynomial each in production and decay.

In practice, the template distributions \(T_{\text{in}}\) are obtained from the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the signal process for a given coupling configuration \(\vec{g}_{i}\). The minimal number \(N\) of Monte Carlo samples needed to describe the signal at all possible coupling configurations, depends on the number \(n\) of studied non-SM coupling parameters. The contribution of each sample \(T_{\text{in}}\) is weighted by a weight \(w_{i}\) based on the assumption that the value of a physical observable is proportional to the squared matrix element for the studied process

\[T\propto\mathcal{M}^{2}. \tag{2}\]

The weights \(w_{i}\) can therefore be expressed as functions of the coupling parameters in the matrix element \(\mathcal{M}\). In this case \(T\) can be anything derived from the Matrix element, for example a whole MC sample.

The described procedure allows for a continuous description in an \(n\)-dimensional parameter space. A feature-complete implementation has been developed within the RooFit package [6], making use of HistFactory [7]. The provided signal model can therefore be used in commonly used RooFit workspaces in a straightforward, blackbox-like way.

In the remainder of this section, several examples for the construction of the model with the morphing method will be shown for the case of Higgs boson production and decay with only one or two non-SM coupling parameters. Subsequently, a generalisation to an \(n\)-dimensional coupling parameter space will be presented. Finally, the method is compared and contrasted with the well-established matrix element reweighting approach [8].

### Morphing with one non-SM coupling parameter in the production or decay vertex

As the most simple case, a morphing function is determined with only one non-SM Higgs coupling \(g_{\text{BSM}}\) contributing to the decay or production in addition to the SM Higgs boson coupling \(g_{\text{SM}}\). A typical example is a mixture of the SM and CP-odd Higgs boson couplings to two vector bosons, studied in detail in LHC Run 1 [1, 2].

The matrix element of such a scenario for given values of \(\{g_{\text{SM}},\,g_{\text{BSM}}\}\) can be written as a sum of the pure SM and the pure BSM contribution1

Footnote 1: In this and the following section, the notation \(\mathcal{O}\) will be used for the amplitude,whereas the notation \(\mathcal{M}\) will be used for fully computed matrix elements. However, since the difference is only conceptual, the symbols are used interchangeably.

\[\mathcal{M}(g_{\text{SM}},g_{\text{BSM}})=g_{\text{SM}}\cdot\mathcal{O}_{\text {SM}}+g_{\text{BSM}}\cdot\mathcal{O}_{\text{BSM}}. \tag{3}\]

This translates into the description of a physical observable \(T\) from the above signal process,

\[T(g_{\text{SM}},g_{\text{BSM}})\propto|\mathcal{M}(g_{\text{SM}},g_{\text{BSM }})|^{2}=g_{\text{SM}}^{2}\cdot\mathcal{O}_{\text{SM}}^{2}+g_{\text{BSM}}^{2} \cdot\mathcal{O}_{\text{BSM}}^{2}+g_{\text{SM}}\cdot g_{\text{BSM}}\cdot 2 \Re(\mathcal{O}_{\text{SM}}^{*}\mathcal{O}_{\text{BSM}}). \tag{4}\]

This can be used to morph to an arbitrary parameter point.

The number of input distributions required to morph to an arbitrary parameter point \(\vec{g}_{\text{target}}=\{g_{\text{SM}},g_{\text{BSM}}\}\) is equal to the unique terms in the matrix element squared, which is three in this case. It is sufficient to generate a pure SM distribution \(T_{\text{in}}(1,0)\), a pure BSM distribution \(T_{\text{in}}(0,1)\) and a mixed distribution \(T_{\text{in}}(1,1)\). Using the proportionalities to the matrix element squared one obtains

\[\begin{split}& T_{\text{in}}(1,0)\propto|\mathcal{O}_{\text{SM}}| ^{2},\\ & T_{\text{in}}(0,1)\propto|\mathcal{O}_{\text{BSM}}|^{2},\\ & T_{\text{in}}(1,1)\propto|\mathcal{O}_{\text{SM}}|^{2}+| \mathcal{O}_{\text{BSM}}|^{2}+2\Re(\mathcal{O}_{\text{SM}}^{*}\mathcal{O}_{ \text{BSM}}).\end{split} \tag{5}\]

Applying these three equations to Equation 4 results in the morphing function for a distribution at an arbitrary parameter point

\[T_{\text{out}}(g_{\text{SM}},g_{\text{BSM}})=\underbrace{(g_{\text{SM}}^{2}-g _{\text{SM}}g_{\text{BSM}})}_{=w_{1}}T_{\text{in}}(1,0)+\underbrace{(g_{\text{BSM }}^{2}-g_{\text{SM}}g_{\text{BSM}})}_{=w_{2}}T_{\text{in}}(0,1)+\underbrace{g _{\text{SM}}g_{\text{BSM}}}_{=w_{3}}T_{\text{in}}(1,1). \tag{6}\]

Figure 1: Illustration of the morphing procedure in a simple showcase.

The derivation of this is graphically depicted in Figure 1.

The output distribution can be created by only using the three input distributions multiplied by the appropriate weight factor \(w_{i}\). Since fixed parameters for the input distributions were used, the weights only depend on the desired parameters for the output distribution.

To minimise later statistical uncertainty in the considered parameter space, it is favourable to be flexible in choosing the parameters for the input distributions. In order to develop a generalisation for a morphing function with arbitrary input parameters \(\vec{g}_{i}\), the proportionality to the matrix element squared of the three input distributions can be written in the following way:

\[T_{\text{in}}(g_{\text{SM},i},g_{\text{BSM},i})\propto g_{\text{SM},i}^{2}| \mathcal{O}_{\text{SM}}|^{2}+g_{\text{BSM},i}^{2}|\mathcal{O}_{\text{BSM}}|^{2 }+2g_{\text{SM},i}g_{\text{BSM},i}\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{O}_{\text{SM}}^{*} \mathcal{O}_{\text{BSM}}),\;i=1,\ldots 3. \tag{7}\]

Now, the following ansatz can be made for the morphing function:

\[\begin{split} T_{\text{out}}(g_{\text{SM},}g_{\text{BSM}})& =\underbrace{(a_{11}g_{\text{SM}}^{2}+a_{12}g_{\text{BSM}}^{2}+a_{ 13}g_{\text{SM}}g_{\text{BSM}})}_{w_{1}}T_{\text{in}}(g_{\text{SM},1},g_{ \text{BSM},1})\\ &+\underbrace{(a_{21}g_{\text{SM}}^{2}+a_{22}g_{\text{BSM}}^{2}+ a_{23}g_{\text{SM}}g_{\text{BSM}})}_{w_{2}}T_{\text{in}}(g_{\text{SM},2},g_{ \text{BSM},2})\\ &+\underbrace{(a_{31}g_{\text{SM}}^{2}+a_{32}g_{\text{BSM}}^{2}+ a_{33}g_{\text{SM}}g_{\text{BSM}})}_{w_{3}}T_{\text{in}}(g_{\text{SM},3},g_{ \text{BSM},3}).\end{split} \tag{8}\]

Until this point this contains unknown variables \(a_{ij}\). For any of the input parameters, the morphing function should regain the input distribution

\[T_{\text{out}}=T_{\text{in}}\qquad\text{for}\qquad\vec{g}_{\text{target}}= \vec{g}_{i}. \tag{9}\]

This results in exactly the right number of constraints needed to recover the unknown variables \(a_{ij}\)

\[\begin{split} 1&=a_{11}g_{\text{SM},1}^{2}+a_{12}g_{ \text{BSM},1}^{2}+a_{13}g_{\text{SM},1}g_{\text{BSM},1}\\ 0&=a_{21}g_{\text{SM},1}^{2}+a_{22}g_{\text{BSM},1}^{2 }+a_{23}g_{\text{SM},1}g_{\text{BSM},1}\\ \ldots\end{split} \tag{10}\]

All constraints can be written in a compact matrix form

\[\begin{pmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}\\ a_{21}&a_{22}&a_{23}\\ a_{31}&a_{32}&a_{33}\end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix}g_{\text{SM},1}^{2} &g_{\text{SM},2}^{2}&g_{\text{SM},3}^{2}\\ g_{\text{BSM},1}^{2}&g_{\text{BSM},2}^{2}&g_{\text{BSM},3}^{2}\\ g_{\text{SM},1}g_{\text{BSM},1}&g_{\text{SM},2}g_{\text{BSM},2}&g_{\text{SM},3 }g_{\text{BSM},3}\end{pmatrix}=1\!\!1 \tag{11}\] \[\Leftrightarrow\qquad\qquad A\cdot G=1\!\!1.\]

The unique solution \(A=G^{-1}\) requires the input parameters to fulfil the condition \(\det(G)\neq 0\).

### Morphing with one non-SM coupling parameter in both production and decay

Having a BSM parameter applied in production and decay requires certain adjustments in calculating the morphing function. For simplicity a scenario is discussed for two parameters \(g_{\text{SM}}\) and \(g_{\text{BSM}}\), which are now (in contrast to the previous section) applied in the production and decay vertex. An example for such a scenario would be Higgs boson production via VBF with decays into two vector bosons \(V\) using the SM and one BSM \(HVV\) operator.

Again the matrix element squared can be factorised in the following way, assuming the narrow width approximation:

\[\mathcal{M}(g_{\text{SM}},g_{\text{BSM}})=\left(g_{\text{SM}}\cdot\mathcal{O}_{ \text{SM},p}+g_{\text{BSM}}\cdot\mathcal{O}_{\text{BSM},p}\right)\cdot\left(g_ {\text{SM}}\cdot\mathcal{O}_{\text{SM},d}+g_{\text{BSM}}\cdot\mathcal{O}_{ \text{BSM},d}\right)\,. \tag{12}\]

By squaring the matrix element additional interference terms emerge

\[|\mathcal{M}(g_{\text{SM}},g_{\text{BSM}})|^{2} =\left(g_{\text{SM}}\mathcal{O}_{\text{SM},p}+g_{\text{BSM}} \mathcal{O}_{\text{BSM},p}\right)^{2}\cdot\left(g_{\text{SM}}\mathcal{O}_{ \text{SM},d}+g_{\text{BSM}}\mathcal{O}_{\text{BSM},d}\right)^{2}\] \[=g_{\text{SM}}^{4}\cdot\mathcal{O}_{\text{SM},p}^{2}\mathcal{O}_{ \text{SM},d}^{2}+g_{\text{BSM}}^{4}\cdot\mathcal{O}_{\text{BSM},p}^{2}\mathcal{ O}_{\text{BSM},d}^{2}\] \[+g_{\text{SM}}^{3}g_{\text{BSM}}\cdot\left(\mathcal{O}_{\text{SM},p}^{2}\Re(\mathcal{O}_{\text{SM},d}^{*}\mathcal{O}_{\text{BSM},d})+\Re( \mathcal{O}_{\text{SM},p}^{*}\mathcal{O}_{\text{BSM},p})\mathcal{O}_{\text{SM},d}^{2}\right)\] \[+g_{\text{SM}}^{2}g_{\text{BSM}}^{2}\cdot\left(\mathcal{O}_{ \text{SM},p}^{2}\mathcal{O}_{\text{BSM},d}^{2}+\mathcal{O}_{\text{BSM},p}^{2} \mathcal{O}_{\text{SM},d}\right)\] \[+g_{\text{SM}}g_{\text{BSM}}^{3}\cdot\left(\mathcal{O}_{\text{BSM },p}^{2}\Re(\mathcal{O}_{\text{SM},d}^{*}\mathcal{O}_{\text{BSM},d})+\Re( \mathcal{O}_{\text{SM},p}^{*}\mathcal{O}_{\text{BSM},p})\mathcal{O}_{\text{BSM },d}^{2}\right). \tag{13}\]

Equation 13 is a 4th order polynomial in the coupling parameters \(g\). Each unique term in coupling parameters requires an input distribution for the morphing, which results in 5 different samples for this scenario. The morphing function for arbitrary values of \(g_{\text{SM}}\) and \(g_{\text{BSM}}\) for the input distributions is obtained in a similar way as for the previous case. First the input distributions are proportional to the matrix element squared

\[T_{\text{in}}(g_{\text{SM},i},g_{\text{BSM},i})\propto|\mathcal{M}(g_{\text{ SM}},g_{\text{BSM}})|^{2},\;i=1,\ldots 5. \tag{14}\]

Again, an ansatz is used for the morphing function

\[T_{\text{out}}(g_{\text{SM}},g_{\text{BSM}}) =\underbrace{\left(a_{11}g_{\text{SM}}^{4}+a_{12}g_{\text{SM}}^{ 3}g_{\text{BSM}}+a_{13}g_{\text{SM}}^{2}g_{\text{BSM}}^{2}+a_{14}g_{\text{SM} }g_{\text{BSM}}^{3}+a_{15}g_{\text{BSM}}^{4}\right)}_{w_{1}}T_{\text{in}}(g_{ \text{SM},1},g_{\text{BSM},1})\] \[=\underbrace{\left(a_{21}g_{\text{SM}}^{4}+a_{22}g_{\text{SM}}^{ 3}g_{\text{BSM}}+a_{23}g_{\text{SM}}^{2}g_{\text{BSM}}^{2}+a_{24}g_{\text{SM} }g_{\text{BSM}}^{3}+a_{25}g_{\text{BSM}}^{4}\right)}_{w_{2}}T_{\text{in}}(g_{ \text{SM},2},g_{\text{BSM},2})\] \[=\underbrace{\left(a_{31}g_{\text{SM}}^{4}+a_{32}g_{\text{SM}}^{ 3}g_{\text{BSM}}+a_{33}g_{\text{SM}}^{2}g_{\text{BSM}}^{2}+a_{34}g_{\text{SM} }g_{\text{BSM}}^{3}+a_{35}g_{\text{BSM}}^{4}\right)}_{w_{3}}T_{\text{in}}(g_{ \text{SM},3},g_{\text{BSM},3})\] \[=\underbrace{\left(a_{41}g_{\text{SM}}^{4}+a_{42}g_{\text{SM}}^{ 3}g_{\text{BSM}}+a_{43}g_{\text{SM}}^{2}g_{\text{BSM}}^{2}+a_{44}g_{\text{SM} }g_{\text{BSM}}^{3}+a_{45}g_{\text{BSM}}^{4}\right)}_{w_{4}}T_{\text{in}}(g_{ \text{SM},4},g_{\text{BSM},4})\] \[=\underbrace{\left(a_{51}g_{\text{SM}}^{4}+a_{52}g_{\text{SM}}^{ 3}g_{\text{BSM}}+a_{53}g_{\text{SM}}^{2}g_{\text{BSM}}^{2}+a_{54}g_{\text{SM} }g_{\text{BSM}}^{3}+a_{55}g_{\text{BSM}}^{4}\right)}_{w_{5}}T_{\text{in}}(g_{ \text{SM},5},g_{\text{BSM},5}). \tag{15}\]

Requiring that the output distribution reproduces the input distributions at their respective parameters, constraints are set to calculate the unknown variables \(a_{ij}\) in the morphing function.

In matrix form, all constraints are written as

\[\begin{pmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}&a_{14}&a_{15}\\ a_{21}&a_{22}&a_{23}&a_{24}&a_{25}\\ a_{31}&a_{32}&a_{33}&a_{34}&a_{35}\\ a_{41}&a_{42}&a_{43}&a_{44}&a_{45}\\ a_{51}&a_{52}&a_{53}&a_{54}&a_{55}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}g_{\text{SM},1}^{ 4}&g_{\text{SM},2}^{4}&g_{\text{SM},3}^{4}&g_{\text{SM},4}^{4}&g_{\text{SM},5} ^{4}\\ g_{\text{SM},1}^{3}g_{\text{BSM},1}&g_{\text{SM},2}^{3}g_{\text{BSM},2}&g_{ \text{SM},3}^{3}g_{\text{BSM},3}&g_{\text{SM},4}^{3}g_{\text{BSM},4}&g_{\text{SM },5}^{4}g_{\text{BSM},5}\\ g_{\text{SM},1}^{2}g_{\text{BSM},1}^{2}&g_{\text{SM},2}^{2}g_{\text{BSM},2}^{2}& g_{\text{SM},3}^{2}g_{\text{BSM},3}^{2}&g_{\text{SM},4}^{2}g_{\text{BSM},4}^{2}&g_{ \text{SM},5}^{2}g_{\text{BSM},5}^{2}\\ g_{\text{SM},1}g_{\text{BSM},1}^{3}&g_{\text{SM},2}g_{\text{BSM},2}^{3}&g_{ \text{SM},3}^{3}g_{\text{BSM},3}&g_{\text{SM},4}g_{\text{BSM},4}^{3}&g_{\text{SM },5}^{3}g_{\text{BSM},5}\\ g_{\text{BSM},1}^{4}&g_{\text{BSM},2}^{4}&g_{\text{BSM},3}^{4}&g_{\text{BSM},4 }^{4}&g_{\text{BSM},4}^{4}&g_{\text{BSM},5}^{4}\end{pmatrix}=\openone \tag{16}\]

Again, the input parameters must be chosen such that the requirement \(\det(G)\neq 0\) is satisfied.

### Generalisation to higher-dimensional parameter space

After the instructional examples provided above in sections 2.2 and 2.3, it is now straightforward to spell out a step-by-step explanation on how to construct the morphing function for processes with an arbitrary number of free coupling parameters in two vertices.

1. Construct a general matrix element squared \[|\mathcal{M}(\vec{g})|^{2}=\underbrace{\left(\sum_{x\in p,\,b}g_{x}\mathcal{ O}(g_{x})\right)^{2}\cdot\underbrace{\left(\sum_{x\in d,\,b}g_{x}\mathcal{O}(g_{x}) \right)^{2}}_{\text{decay}}}_{\text{production}}.\] (17)
2. Expand the matrix element squared to a 4th degree polynominal in the coupling parameters \[|\mathcal{M}(\vec{g})|^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}X_{i}\cdot P_{i}\left(\vec{g}\right),\] (18) \(X_{i}\) is a prefactor, which will be represented by an input distribution. In the 4th degree polynomial \(P_{i}\left(\vec{g}\right)=g_{a}g_{b}g_{c}g_{d}\) of the coupling parameters \(\vec{g}\), the same coupling can occur multiple times (e.g. \(g_{\text{SM}}^{4}\) or \(g_{\text{BSM},1}g_{\text{BSM},2}g_{\text{BSM},3}^{2}\)). The number of different expressions in the polynomial \(N\) is equal to the number of samples needed for the morphing.
3. Next generate input distributions at arbitrary but fixed parameter points \(\vec{g}_{i}\) \[T_{\text{in},i}\propto|\mathcal{M}(\vec{g}_{i})|^{2}\,.\] (19)
4. Construct the morphing function with an ansatz \[T_{\text{out}}(\vec{g}) =\sum_{i=1}^{N}\underbrace{\left(\sum_{j=1}^{N}A_{ij}P_{j}\left( \vec{g}\right)\right)}_{w_{i}\left(\vec{g}\right)}T_{\text{in},i}.\] (20) \[=\vec{P}\left(\vec{g}\right)\cdot A\vec{T},\] (21) where the second line is the first one recast in matrix notation. The matrix \(A\) has to be calculated to obtain the full morphing function.

5. Thus, exploit that the output distribution should be equal to the input distribution at the respective input parameters \[T_{\text{out}}\left(\vec{g}_{i}\right)=T_{\text{in},i}\qquad\text{for}\qquad i=1, \ldots,N.\] (22) which can also be cast in matrix notation as \[\begin{split}& A\cdot\left(P_{j}\left(\vec{g}_{i}\right)\right)_{ ij}=\openone\\ &\Leftrightarrow\qquad A\cdot G=\openone.\end{split}\] (23)
6. The unique solution \(A=G^{-1}\) requires the input parameters to fulfil the condition \(\det(G)\neq 0\). When the aim is to perform a likelihood fit on some (pseudo-)data \(T_{d}\), the minimisation condition is \[\widehat{\vec{g}}\left(T_{d}\right)=\underset{\vec{g}}{\arg\min}-2\ln P\left( T_{d}\mid\mu=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{N}A_{ij}P_{j}\left(\vec{g}\right) \right)T_{\text{in},i}\right).\] (24)

From this it becomes apparent that only the polynomials \(P_{j}\left(\vec{g}\right)\) need to be recalculated during the minimisation process, while the non-trivial quantities \(A_{ij}\) and \(T_{\text{in},i}\) stay fixed.

The error propagation of statistical uncertainties to the output \(T_{\text{out}}\) is conceptually straightforward. Since the \(\vec{g}_{i}\) are free parameters, the matrix \(A\) carries no uncertainty besides numerical fluctuations. Thus, uncertainties only propagate via linear combinations. The question of how the input parameters \(\vec{g}_{i}\) need to be chosen such that the expected uncertainty of the output is minimal, within some parameter region of interest, is non-trivial and will be addressed in future studies.

The number of base samples increases if there are additional coupling parameters to be considered in the production or decay vertex, for example in the case of a combination of measurements in several production and decay modes. However, the general morphing principle remains the same and the method can be generalised to a higher-dimensional coupling parameter space. The number \(N\) of input base samples depends on how many of the \(n\) studied coupling parameters enter the production and/or the decay vertex.

In case of the gluon fusion process with subsequent decays to vector bosons, the production and decay will have a completely disjoint set of couplings, and the number of input samples will be

\[N_{\text{ggF}}=n_{p}\cdot\frac{n_{p}+1}{2}\cdot n_{d}\cdot\frac{n_{d}+1}{2}, \tag{25}\]

where \(n_{p}\) are the number of parameters included for the production and \(n_{d}\) the number of parameters included for the decay.

For the VBF Higgs boson production with subsequent decay into vector bosons, when considering the exact same set of couplings in the production and the decay vertex, the number of samples is given by

\[N_{\text{VBF}}=\binom{4+n_{s}-1}{4}, \tag{26}\]

where \(n_{s}\) is the number samples that are shared in production and decay. Both expressions are just the number of terms in the polynomial obtained upon calculation of the matrix element. A general expression for \(n_{p}\) couplings appearing only in production, \(n_{d}\) couplings appearing only in decay and \(n_{s}\) couplings shared in production and decay can be obtained by careful counting as

\[N =\quad\frac{n_{p}\left(n_{p}+1\right)}{2}\cdot\frac{n_{d}\ (n_{d}+1)}{2}+\binom{4+n_{s}-1}{4} \tag{27}\] \[+\left(n_{p}\cdot n_{s}+\frac{n_{s}\ (n_{s}+1)}{2}\right)\cdot \frac{n_{d}\ (n_{d}+1)}{2}\] (28) \[+\left(n_{d}\cdot n_{s}+\frac{n_{s}\ (n_{s}+1)}{2}\right)\cdot \frac{n_{p}\ (n_{p}+1)}{2}\] (29) \[+\frac{n_{s}\ (n_{s}+1)}{2}\cdot n_{p}\cdot n_{d}+\left(n_{p}+n_{ d}\right)\binom{3+n_{s}-1}{3}. \tag{30}\]

In this expression the counting is split for (27) terms pure in production and decay, or pure in shared, (28) terms pure in decay and mixed in production and shared or purely shared, (29) terms pure in production and mixed in decay and shared or purely shared, and (30) terms mixed in both, and terms mixed in one and purely shared in the other.

This is a general definition of the number of samples \(N\) in terms of number of coupling parameters \(n\). For example Equation 25 can be reproduced by setting \(n_{s}=0\) and Equation 26 by \(n_{p}=0\) and \(n_{d}=0\).

The full generality of this method is not exploited in the remainder of this note. The cases discussed here are outlined in Table 1.

### Comparison to the matrix element reweighting method

The morphing method presented here is complimentary to the well-known matrix element method. Hence, the latter method is briefly summarised with the intent of highlighting the differences between the methods as well as how the two methods complement each other.

The calculation of theory predictions for e. g. differential cross sections is most conveniently performed via Monte Carlo integration techniques. In these techniques the distribution in question is probed with a finite set of phase space points, which are then treated analogously to observed collision events in data analysis. These probing points, or Monte Carlo events, may carry a certain weight - an arbitrary number assigned by the generator to encode the magnitude of the contribution of this phase space point to the distribution of interest. Some generators choose to use adaptive Monte Carlo techniques to adjust their sampling distribution according to the probed distribution. This ensures that the event weights generated are within a certain (narrow) acceptance band, thus reducing uncertainty of the result. Having events with different weights contributing to the same distribution does not pose any conceptual problems.

\begin{tabular}{r l r r r r} Section, & Process & \(n_{p}\) & \(n_{d}\) & \(n_{s}\) & \(N\) \\ \hline

Table 1: Overview of the showcases presented in this note in terms of the \(n\)-dimensional generalisation.

Since the weight of an event is a measure of the probability assigned to this phase space point (taking into account the sampling distribution of the generator), it is related to the matrix element of the process in question. For some theoretical framework \(\alpha\), the event weight depends on the parton distribution functions \(f_{1}\) and \(f_{2}\) as well as on the transfer or (detector) resolution function \(W(x,y)\):

\[\omega_{\alpha}(x)\propto P_{\alpha}(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma}\int d\phi(y)\left| \mathcal{M}_{\alpha}(y)\right|^{2}dw_{1}dw_{2}f_{1}(w_{1})f_{2}(w_{2})W(x,y). \tag{31}\]

This translates the true quantities of the simulated particles \(y\) to the observable quantities \(x\) of the same particles after detector simulation and reconstruction and, most notably, on the modulus square of the matrix element \(M_{\alpha}\) of this transition within the given theoretical framework [8].

As the detector resolution simulation is highly non-trivial and commonly the most expensive part of the event generation process, it has become common practice to generate and simulate events for some theoretical setup \(\alpha\) and then, afterwards, translate them to a different theoretical setup \(\alpha^{\prime}\) by considering the ratio between the matrix elements, i. e.

\[\omega_{\alpha^{\prime}}(y)=\omega_{\alpha}(y)\frac{\left|\mathcal{M}_{\alpha ^{\prime}}(y)\right|^{2}}{\left|\mathcal{M}_{\alpha}(y)\right|^{2}}, \tag{32}\]

where the knowledge of the generator information \(y\) for the simulated events is exploited to be able to reweight them according to the matrix element values.

This method is related to the morphing technique presented here in that it allows to exploit precomputed results to perform a exact translation into a different theoretical framework. However the matrix element reweighting is a technique that only requires a single input sample and performs the translation on an event-by-event basis, whereas the morphing technique requires several input samples, but is capable of morphing entire distributions of observables. Given the expense of iterating over large input datasets and performing the matrix element calculation on every event, the new morphing method is several orders of magnitude faster in a typical scenario and thus provides the ability to (precisely) approximate the matrix-element weighting in iterative procedures like fits. In order to achieve the same interpolation power with matrix element reweighting, one would need to produce a vast number of reweighted samples, hugely exceeding the number of input samples for the morphing.

However, as the morphing technique requires a (possibly large) number of input samples, it still requires a large amount of resources to be provided upfront for generating and especially simulating the input samples. Therefore a hybrid approach using both methods in a complementary fashion by using matrix element reweighting to save time on detector simulation when creating input samples for applications of morphing is very promising.

## 3 Parametrisation in the frame of the Higgs characterisation model

The morphing method is completely independent from the parametrisation that is chosen to model non-SM couplings in the interaction of the Higgs boson to SM particles.

For the validation of the morphing method in Section 5.1 the parametrisation of the Higgs characterisation model [9] is chosen. This model has been used in the recently published ATLAS Run 1 analysis [1].

The Higgs characterisation model describes the non-SM couplings of the Higgs boson based on an effective field theory approach. Within this model, the effective Lagrangian for the interaction of a spin-0 particle with gauge bosons is given by

\[\mathcal{L}_{0}^{V}= \bigg{\{}c_{\alpha}\kappa_{SM}\left[\frac{1}{2}g_{HZZ}Z_{\mu}Z^{\mu} +g_{HWW}W^{+}_{\mu}W^{-\mu}\right] \tag{33}\] \[-\frac{1}{4}\left[c_{\alpha}\kappa_{H\gamma\gamma}g_{H\gamma\gamma }A_{\mu\nu}A^{\mu\nu}+s_{\alpha}\kappa_{A\gamma\gamma}g_{A\gamma\gamma}A_{\mu \nu}\tilde{A}^{\mu\nu}\right]\] \[-\frac{1}{2}\left[c_{\alpha}\kappa_{HZV}g_{HZV}Z_{\mu\nu}A^{\mu \nu}+s_{\alpha}\kappa_{AZ\gamma}g_{AZ\gamma}Z_{\mu\nu}\tilde{A}^{\mu\nu}\right]\] \[-\frac{1}{4}\left[c_{\alpha}\kappa_{Hgg}g_{Hgg}G^{a}_{\mu\nu}G^{ a,\mu\nu}+s_{\alpha}\kappa_{Agg}g_{Agg}G^{a}_{\mu\nu}\tilde{G}^{a,\mu\nu} \right]\] \[-\frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{\Lambda}\left[c_{\alpha}\kappa_{HZZ}Z_{\mu \nu}Z^{\mu\nu}+s_{\alpha}\kappa_{AZZ}Z_{\mu\nu}\tilde{Z}^{\mu\nu}\right]\] \[-\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{\Lambda}\left[c_{\alpha}\kappa_{HWW}W^{+}_{ \mu\nu}W^{-\mu\nu}+s_{\alpha}\kappa_{AWW}W^{+}_{\mu\nu}\tilde{W}^{-\mu\nu}\right]\] \[-\frac{1}{\Lambda}c_{\alpha}\left[\kappa_{H\partial\gamma}Z_{ \nu}\partial_{\mu}A^{\mu\nu}+\kappa_{H\partial Z}Z_{\nu}\partial_{\mu}Z^{\mu \nu}+\kappa_{H\partial W}(W^{+}_{\nu}\partial_{\mu}W^{-\mu\nu}+h.c.)\right] \bigg{\}}\mathcal{X}_{0},\]

where the notation

\[c_{\alpha}\equiv\cos\left(\alpha\right),\qquad s_{\alpha}\equiv\sin\left(\alpha\right) \tag{34}\]

is used.

All couplings \(\kappa_{Hxx^{\prime}}\) describe CP-even interactions, and coupling strengths \(\kappa_{Axx^{\prime}}\) CP-odd interactions. Here, \(c_{\alpha}\) is the mixing angle between CP-even and CP-odd couplings. Couplings \(g_{XYyy^{\prime}}\) are defined to reproduce the Standard Model couplings in case of CP-even interactions and a CP-odd 2HDM with \(\tan\left(\beta\right)=1\) for CP-odd ones. In the Standard Model CP-even couplings \(Hgg\), \(HZ\gamma\) and \(H\gamma\gamma\) appear at loop level. In the Higgs characterisation model those interactions are described as effective couplings. The respective coupling strengths \(g_{Hyy^{\prime}}\) are defined in [9] to retrieve the SM coupling value when setting \(\kappa_{Hgg}\), \(\kappa_{HZ\gamma}\), \(\kappa_{H\gamma\gamma}\) to one. For the SM VBF production the contributions of \(HZ\gamma\) and \(H\gamma\gamma\) are very small in comparison to the tree level coupling to a pair of Z or W bosons. Therefore those contributions can be neglected, and the Standard Model is retrieved from the above equation by setting \(c_{\alpha}=1\) and \(\kappa_{\text{SM}}=1\), with all other couplings \(\kappa_{Xyy^{\prime}}\) set to zero. For gluon fusion Higgs production the SM is recovered by setting \(c_{\alpha}=1\) and \(\kappa_{Hgg}=1\).

\(\Lambda\) is the cut-off scale of the effective theory and BSM couplings are suppressed by a factor \(\frac{1}{\Lambda}\). For a more detailed description of the model see Reference [9]. In this note, the cut-off scale \(\Lambda\) is fixed to \(1\,\text{TeV}\) and \(c_{\alpha}\) to \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\).

## 4 Extracting parameters

The morphing method presented here is related to interpolation techniques already implemented HistFactory[7], like Moment Morphing [5], and is intended for use on physical observables such as cross sections or distributions retrieved after the full processing of event generation, simulation, digitisation, reconstruction and selection. The described procedure has been implemented in RooFit [6]. Some detail on the implementation is provided in this section.

The implementation has been performed as a single class by the name of RooEFTMorphFunc, analogous to other interpolation techniques already implemented in the RooStats statistics framework. The input is retrieved from an external file, which should contain the physical quantities subject to the morphing (total or differential cross sections) as well as the sets of input parameters. The user is expected to provide details on the model in which the morphing should be performed, either by providing a list of available couplings and vertices in which they appear manually, or by using one of the pre-made constructors for different Higgs boson production and decay mechanisms that are currently implemented that include VBF and ggF Higgs boson production with weak bosonic decay modes.

The implementation uses the procedure outlined in Section 2.4 to construct a morphing function on the setup provided, where the physical inputs \(T\) are typically incorporated by histograms. The couplings \(g\), which might have been provided by the user or created by the class internally, can either be free parameters or be incorporated as derived quantities depending on some other parameter set, most notably the set of coupling strength parameters \(\kappa\). The matrix inversion required for the construction of the morphing function is usually performed via the standard matrix implementation of the ROOT software framework [10], but this can be replaced by the more sophisticated boost linear algebra library uBLAS [11] at compile-time, which allows higher numeric accuracy of the result if required.

The RooEFTMorphFunc adheres to the standard RooStats interface of interpolation functions, thus standard minimisation techniques to perform likelihood fits of the morphing function to some target distribution can be applied. With these techniques the couplings act as free parameters to be constrained by the fit, independent of whether they were user-provided or automatically generated.

For the purpose of the studies presented in the following sections, backgrounds, treatment of the total width, and systematic uncertainties have been neglected. As a test statistic for the fits, \(\tilde{t}_{\mu}\)[12], which is minus twice a log-likelihood ratio with the signal parameter(s) constrained to be in the physical region, has been used.

## 5 Validation results

The validation of the morphing method is divided into two parts. In the first part the validation is performed on distributions from MC truth information. The second part of the validation is based on simulated distributions at reconstruction level after full Run 1 analysis selections of the ATLAS \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) analysis group described in Reference [1].

New samples haven been produced for the validation described in Section 5.1, which is performed on the generator level after the parton showering and hadronisation, but without accounting for the detector effects. Samples of events from gluon fusion and VBF Higgs production processes with subsequent decays into two \(W\) or \(Z\) bosons have been produced for the SM and several non-SM coupling configurations with the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO[13] event generator. Parton showers and their hadronisations are generated with Pythia8[14].

The Higgs characterisation (HC) model [9] has been used as a framework for the BSM configurations within the generator. Two different versions of the model are available. The default HC model is used for the VBF processes, whereas for the gluon fusion only the SM production via a heavy quark loop is assumed. The later is modelled by an effective operator, which is implemented in the HC-heft model. All processes are generated at the leading order and with \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV, using the leading-order PDF set NNPDF23.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:13]

#### 5.1.2 Validation in VBF \(H\to WW^{\star}\to e\nu\mu\nu\)

In addition to the SM coupling \(\kappa_{\text{SM}}\) two non-SM couplings \(\kappa_{HWW}\) and \(\kappa_{AWW}\) are used for validation. All three operators act on the production and decay vertex which results in 15 input samples needed for the morphing. Besides these 15 input samples additional validation samples are produced to have statistically independent distributions.

An overview of all generated samples in the parameter space can be found in Figure 3, where the two additional validation samples have been highlighted and dubbed v@ and v1. Their parameters have been chosen randomly. For each sample, 50.000 Monte Carlo events have been generated. The cross sections calculated in arbitrary units using the morphing technique can be seen in Figure 4 (left). Using larger absolute non-SM coupling values results in larger rates for both non-SM coupling parameters.

The relative uncertainty arising from the morphing function on the number of events is shown in Figure 4 (right). In the considered parameter space the relative Monte Carlo statistical uncertainty remains very small, in the range of ca. 2-3%, whereas outside the region the uncertainty grows the further away the parameters lie from the input samples. This explains both the local maxima in the central parameter region and the rapid increase in the outer region.

For this channel, the kinematic observable used is the azimuthal angle between the two tagging jets \(\Delta\phi_{jj}\). All input distributions for morphing and validation are scaled to their respective cross section in arbitrary units and shown in Figure 5. When morphing to one of the input samples a perfect match is obtained. The morphing is also tested against statistically independent validation samples, as shown in Figure 6, exhibiting agreement within \(\sim 5\%\) of the input samples and the morphing.

Figure 2: Distributions of \(\cos\left(\theta_{1}\right)\), where \(\theta_{1}\) is the angle between the on-shell \(Z\) boson and its negatively charged lepton (left) and the angle \(\phi\) (right) between the decay planes of the two \(Z\) bosons for events generated in the ggF \(H\to ZZ^{\star}\to 4\ell\) process at 13 TeV, calculated in the rest frame of the Higgs boson [1]. Generated validation samples (solid) as well as predictions calculated via morphing (dashed) are shown. The ratios between the morphing output and the validation distributions are shown in the lower panels.

Figure 4: The number of expected events in the considered parameter space for \(H\to WW^{*}\to e\nu\mu\nu\) calculated with the morphing method is shown on the left. The relative uncertainty on the number of expected events propagated from the morphing function can be seen on the right.

Figure 3: Overview of produced samples for morphing validation in the \(H\to WW^{*}\to e\nu\mu\nu\) channel. The SM coupling \(g_{\rm SM}\) is set to 1 for all input samples and the limits for the BSM parameters are taken such that a pure BSM sample would have the SM cross section. The parameters for the validation samples are taken randomly in the desired parameter space.

### Validation on MC reconstruction level with full analysis selection

In order to validate the morphing procedure after taking detector effects into account, the fully reconstructed Monte Carlo samples of the Run 1 \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) tensor structure analysis [1] have been used as a showcase example.

Mixing of the SM with one additional non-SM parameter, \(\kappa_{HZZ}\) or \(\kappa_{AZZ}\), has been studied in this publication using the parametrisation of the Higgs characterisation model described in Section 3 with the following notation

\[\tilde{\kappa}_{HZZ}=\frac{1}{4}\cdot\frac{v}{\Lambda}\cdot\kappa_{HZZ}, \qquad\tilde{\kappa}_{AZZ}=\frac{1}{4}\cdot\frac{v}{\Lambda}\cdot\kappa_{AZZ}. \tag{35}\]

This check of the morphing is based on the analysis described in [1], where only the dominant production process, gluon fusion Higgs production, has been taken into account. The inputs to the morphing validation in this section are the final distributions of the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) tensor structure analysis. Detector effects are taken into account and the full analysis selection described in the before mentioned publication has been applied. For the Run 1 tensor structure measurement a range of \([-10,10]\) in a step size of 0.25 for the non-SM coupling parameters has been probed.

One of the observables considered for the morphing validation is the angle \(\Phi\) between the decay planes of the two intermediate \(Z\) bosons, which has also been used for the validation described in Section 5.1.1. The other used observable is TO(\(\tilde{\kappa}_{AZZ},\alpha\)), which is one of the final discriminating variables of the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) tensor structure measurement. This observable is sensitive to the amplitude of CP-odd admixtures in the \(HZZ\) coupling structure. A more detailed description of both variables can be found on pages 17 and 24 in the original publication.

Arbitrary distributions from the ggF \(H\to 4\mu\) channel at 8 TeV have been chosen for the validation. The configuration of the morphing input samples, as well of the validation samples, is shown in Table 5.

The configuration of the input samples can be chosen arbitrarily, the only condition being that the corresponding morphing matrix is invertible, as derived in Section 2.4.

The validation sample used for \(\Phi\) uses a SM-like CP-even scenario, whereas the validation sample used for TO(\(\tilde{\kappa}_{AZZ},\alpha\)) employs a CP-odd scenario to show that morphing works in both cases. A comparison of the distribution of the validation samples and the output of the morphing function is shown in Figure 8.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c}  & \(\tilde{\kappa}_{\text{SM}}\) & \(\tilde{\kappa}_{HZZ}\) & \(\tilde{\kappa}_{AZZ}\) \\ \hline Input sample 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ Input sample 2 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ Input sample 3 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ Input sample 4 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ Input sample 5 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ Input sample 6 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ \hline Validation sample \(\Phi\) & 1 & -2 & 0 \\ Validation sample \(\Phi\) & 1 & -1.25 & 0 \\ Validation sample TO(\(\tilde{\kappa}_{AZZ},\alpha\)) & 1 & 0 & 5 \\ Validation sample TO(\(\tilde{\kappa}_{AZZ},\alpha\)) & 1 & 0 & 3.25 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Values of the coupling parameters for the morphing input and validation samplesThe perfect agreement of the morphed distributions with the validation samples is expected, since they are not statistically independent. The input samples as well as the validation samples were obtained by ME-reweighting of a single, large sample, as discussed in Section 2.5. Figure 8 shows that more complicated observables can be morphed with this method as well. The correlations between the spin-CP variable distributions used as inputs to the observables are fully reproduced by the morphing.

Overall the morphing validation in this section demonstrates that the described morphing technique is not restricted to generator level. As long as analysis acceptance and detector effects are correctly described in the input distributions, the morphing function is able to describe arbitrary coupling parameter configurations.

## 6 Impact of non-SM coupling parameters in the VBF production vertex

Production of the Higgs boson via vector boson fusion (VBF) is highly sensitive to SM higher order or non-SM contributions in the \(HVV\) production vertex.

So far there are no, or very loose experimental constraints on the contribution of the BSM coupling parameters to the VBF production. Therefore the purpose of this work is to study the VBF vertex and identify with the help of the morphing method described in the previous chapters, a set of relevant non-SM contributions. As a point of reference of the relevance of the parameters a fit to pseudo-data generated for an SM scenario at 13 TeV has been performed, assuming an uncertainty of 8% on the measured cross section (compared to roughly 20% for the ATLAS and CMS combined result from Run 1 [19]). All studied distributions are generator level only and no backgrounds are taken into account.

Figure 8: ggF \(H\to ZZ\to 4\mu\) distributions at 8 \(\,\mathrm{TeV}\) published in Reference [1] comparing the shapes of physical observables \(\Phi\) and \(\mathrm{TO}(\tilde{\kappa}_{AZZ},\alpha)\) for two validation points obtained via Matrix Element reweighting with the output of the morphing function. The perfect agreement is due to the fact both distributions stem from the same original sample.

For the purpose of this study, the Lagrangian of the Higgs characterisation model (presented in Equation 33) describing the interaction of a scalar (Higgs) particle coupling to a pair of gauge bosons is used, including operators up to dimension 6 and their cross terms. The cut-off scale \(\Lambda=1\,\text{TeV}\) is chosen arbitrarily.

### Sample Production

In order to study the BSM contributions in the VBF production, a Higgs boson decay that does not interfere with the production is chosen. For this publication \(H\to\mu\mu\) has been used for purely technical reasons.

The VBF Higgs production process with subsequent decays into two \(W\) or two \(Z\) bosons has been produced for the SM and several BSM coupling configurations with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO[13] event generator. To retain gauge invariance the VBF production also includes the diagrams of the Higgs boson production in association with a hadronicaly decaying vector boson. Parton showers and their hadronisations are generated with Pythia8[14] using the A14 tune [20]. The Higgs characterisation (HC) model [9] has been used as a framework for the BSM configurations within the generator.

### Choice of Samples

In total there are 15 non-SM coupling parameters in the \(HVV\) vertex described as in the Higgs characterisation model in Equation 33. A subset of 13 parameters contributes to the VBF production vertex, listed in Table 6.

In order to describe all BSM parameters in production with the morphing method, 91 input samples are necessary. Each sample was generated with 30.000 Monte Carlo events. The configurations of those samples were chosen with the following requirements:

1. Experimental sensitivity: Chose values of BSM parameters within experimental sensitivity. The Run 1 limit on VBF cross section is \(\sigma_{\text{VBF}}\lessapprox(1+\frac{1}{4})\cdot\sigma_{\text{VBF,SM}}\). Values of the coupling parameters

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c} \(\kappa_{\text{SM}}\) & 1 \\ \(\kappa_{H\gamma\gamma}\) & 203.22 \\ \(\kappa_{A\gamma\gamma}\) & 408.62 \\ \(\kappa_{HZ\gamma}\) & 109.13 \\ \(\kappa_{AZ\gamma}\) & 986.88 \\ \(\kappa_{HZZ}\) & 5.75 \\ \(\kappa_{AZZ}\) & 6.96 \\ \(\kappa_{HWW}\) & 3.36 \\ \(\kappa_{AWW}\) & 3.92 \\ \(\kappa_{H\partial WR}=\Re(\kappa_{H\partial W})\) & 0.76 \\ \(\kappa_{H\partial WI}=\Im(\kappa_{H\partial W})\) & 0.84 \\ \(\kappa_{H\partial A}\) & 1.77 \\ \(\kappa_{H\partial Z}\) & 1.37 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: The listed values of the coupling parameters reproduce the Standard Model cross section at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. A combination of these parameters, where either the positive or the negative of the listed value is taken, is used to construct the 91 input samples for the presented VBF production vertex study.

have been calculated to reproduce the SM cross section for pure BSM samples [19]. The values are listed in Table 6.
2. Run 1 results: No large deviations from the SM were found in Run 1 [19], therefore the input samples, with the exception of the pure SM sample itself, are all mixtures of SM with one or two additional BSM parameters.
3. Well defined coverage of BSM parameter phase space: Mixtures of SM plus one additional BSM parameter have been used as input with both positive and negative values for the BSM coupling strength.
4. Input samples can also represent smaller morphing input sets: Parameter configurations were chosen in such a way that also input sample sets which allow morphing to distributions with \(n=2,\ldots,13\) BSM parameters are well represented.

### Results

Events with a \(H\to\mu\mu\) candidate and at least two jets are selected. Muons are required to be oppositely charged and to be within the ATLAS detector acceptance defined by \(p_{T,\,\mu}>6\,\) GeV and \(|\eta_{\mu}|<2.7\). Jets on generator truth level are reconstructed using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [17, 18] with a distance parameter of \(R=0.4\). A minimum transverse momentum of \(20\,\) GeV is required for jets, as well as a pseudo-rapidity of \(|\eta_{j}|<5.0\). Additionally the jets have to have a minimum distance of \(\Delta R_{jj}>5\). This results in the selection of an VH suppressed phase space, for future studies this requirement will be removed in order to ensure an inclusive selection.

The study has been conducted taking the following distributions in the di-jet system into account: \(\Delta\eta_{jj}\), \(\Delta\Phi_{jj}\), \(m_{jj}\) and \(p_{T,j1}\). Distributions for the comparison of SM with mixing of SM plus BSM CP-even coupling \(\kappa_{HWW}\) are shown in Figure 9. The distributions in \(m_{jj}\) and \(\Delta\eta_{jj}\) are correlated. The observable \(\Delta\Phi_{jj}\) includes sign information of the BSM coupling parameter for \(\kappa_{HZZ}\), \(\kappa_{HZA}\) and \(\kappa_{HWW}\). The distributions \(p_{T,j1}\) and \(\Delta\eta_{jj}\) are sign-sensitive for \(\kappa_{H\,\partial Z}\) and \(\kappa_{H\,\partial W_{R}}\).

For the study of the VBF production the above observables are combined into one final distribution \(\mathrm{var_{4d}}\) shown in Figure 13, which takes into account all correlations between the input variables. The combined variable \(\mathrm{var_{4d}}\) is constructed in the following manner;

\[\mathrm{var_{4d}}=3^{3}\cdot i_{\Delta\eta_{jj}}+3^{2}\cdot i_{m_{jj}}+3\cdot i _{p_{T,j1}}+i_{\Delta\Phi_{jj}},\]

where the values of each of the four variables are divided into three bins

\[i_{\mathrm{var}}=\begin{cases}0&\mathrm{var}<\left(\min_{\mathrm{var}}+\frac {1}{3}\cdot(\max_{\mathrm{var}}-\min_{\mathrm{var}})\right)\\ 1&\left(\min_{\mathrm{var}}+\frac{1}{3}\cdot(\max_{\mathrm{var}}-\min_{ \mathrm{var}})\right)\leq\mathrm{var}<\left(\min_{\mathrm{var}}+\frac{2}{3} \cdot(\max_{\mathrm{var}}-\min_{\mathrm{var}})\right)\\ 2&\mathrm{var}\geq\left(\min_{\mathrm{var}}+\frac{2}{3}\cdot(\max_{\mathrm{ var}}-\min_{\mathrm{var}})\right)\end{cases}.\]

The minimum and maximum values of each variable are listed in Table 7.

A multidimensional model of this combined distribution has been constructed for the VBF signal, based on the morphing function, which is implemented as described in Section 4.

The sensitivity to the coupling parameters and their correlations are retrieved by fitting a SM pseudo-dataset produced at \(13\,\)TeV with an assumed statistical uncertainty of \(8\%\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}  & \(\Delta\eta_{jj}\) & \(m_{jj}\) [GeV] & \(p_{T,j1}\) [GeV] & \(\Delta\Phi_{jj}\) \\ \hline min & 0 & 0 & 20 & 0 \\ max & 6 & 1000 & 200 & \(\pi\) \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The size of the boxes correspond to the Monte Carlo statistical uncertainties.

In Table 8 the post-fit values of all coupling parameters and their respective fit errors are listed. The value of the fit error provides insight about the sensitivity of the Monte Carlo signal distribution to this parameter for the given scenario, where large uncertainties correspond to small sensitivity.

The post-fit covariance matrix is shown in Table 9. Depicted values can be compared, for example, to theoretical predictions of BSM coupling parameter correlations. Of course, these correlation values are only valid for the SM and might be dramatically different for other scenarios.

Based on these findings it is foreseen to be able to reduce the dimensionality of the required parameter space by means of a principal component analysis and subsequent reparametrisation and neglecting of parameters to which there is little to no sensitivity. Also, careful study might allow to choose a set of input samples that provide a smaller statistical uncertainty on the fit results.

## 7 Conclusions

This note describes a method for modelling signal parameters and distributions in a multidimensional space of coupling parameters. This method is capable of continuously morphing signal distributions and rates based on a minimal orthogonal set of independent base samples. Therefore it allows to directly fit for the coupling parameters that describe the SM and possibly non-SM interaction of the Higgs boson with fermions and bosons of the SM.

The morphing method has been shown to perform as expected using generator-level and reconstruction-level distributions. In addition, a preliminary study on the impact of BSM coupling parameters in the context of VBF Higgs boson production has been performed, acting both as a proof-of-concept for elaborate studies using this method and as a showcase for the performance of the morphing method.

This method can be utilised to test the properties of the Higgs boson during the LHC Run 2 data-taking period and beyond.

VBF \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) is studied with two non-SM coupling parameters, \(\kappa_{HZZ}\) and \(\kappa_{AZZ}\), in production and decay.

As listed in Table 1, 15 morphing input samples are needed in order to model such a mixture. The parameters of the the input samples, as well as a set of of 5 validation samples are listed in Table 10. Each sample was produced with 50.000 Monte Carlo events.

As a validation variable \(\Delta\Phi_{jj}\) as defined at the beginning of this section has been chosen, but the distribution of any other non-SM coupling sensitive distribution in the jet or \(H\to 4\ell\) decay system can be predicted. The morphing to two validation points (2 and 4 in Table 10) in comparison to the generated distribution, is shown in Figure 14. All distributions are shown normalised to their respective cross sections.

The morphing function describes shape and cross section, depending on the non-SM coupling parameters, in reasonable agreement with the validation distributions.

### Validation in ggF \(H\to WW^{*}\to ev\mu\nu\)

In gluon fusion production for the decay to \(WW\), the azimuthal angle between two leptons \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\), which has already been used in the spin and parity measurement by ATLAS [21], is taken as validation distribution.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c}  & \(\cos\alpha\) & \(\kappa_{Azz}\) & \(\kappa_{Hzz}\) & \(\kappa_{\text{SM}}\) \\ \hline Input Sample 0 & 0.707 & -9.366 & 0.952 & 1.414 \\ Input Sample 1 & 0.707 & 3.655 & 5.189 & 1.414 \\ Input Sample 2 & 0.707 & -5.510 & -7.817 & 1.414 \\ Input Sample 3 & 0.707 & -4.574 & 4.922 & 1.414 \\ Input Sample 4 & 0.707 & 7.739 & -3.261 & 1.414 \\ Input Sample 5 & 0.707 & 0.513 & -5.612 & 1.414 \\ Input Sample 6 & 0.707 & -11.654 & 4.921 & 1.414 \\ Input Sample 7 & 0.707 & -0.781 & 8.461 & 1.414 \\ Input Sample 8 & 0.707 & 9.135 & 1.544 & 1.414 \\ Input Sample 9 & 0.707 & -13.764 & -2.333 & 1.414 \\ Input Sample 10 & 0.707 & -7.100 & -3.737 & 1.414 \\ Input Sample 11 & 0.707 & 10.696 & 5.635 & 1.414 \\ Input Sample 12 & 0.707 & 14.112 & -1.435 & 1.414 \\ Input Sample 13 & 0.707 & 0.000 & 0.000 & 1.414 \\ Input Sample 14 & 0.707 & 6.898 & -7.420 & 1.414 \\ \hline Validation Sample 0 & 0.707 & 8.494 & 0.862 & 1.385 \\ Validation Sample 1 & 0.707 & -0.039 & 7.104 & 1.400 \\ Validation Sample 2 & 0.707 & 1.814 & -2.976 & 1.424 \\ Validation Sample 3 & 0.707 & -10.565 & 1.343 & 1.449 \\ Validation Sample 4 & 0.707 & 10.735 & 5.051 & 1.391 \\ \end{tabular}

Table 10: Overview of the samples used in Section A.1In addition to the SM coupling \(\kappa_{\text{SM}}\) two non-SM couplings, \(\kappa_{HWW}\) and \(\kappa_{AWW}\), are used for validation. All three operators act on the decay vertex which results in 6 input samples needed for the morphing. Besides these 6 input samples additional validation samples are produced to have statistically independent distributions.

An overview of all generated samples in the parameter space can be found in Figure 15. The samples were generated with 50.000 Monte Carlo events each. The cross sections calculated in arbitrary units using the morphing technique can be seen in Figure 16 (left). Using larger absolute non-SM coupling values results in larger rates for both non-SM coupling parameters. The relative Monte Carlo statistical uncertainty arising from the morphing function on the number of events is shown in Figure 16 (right). In the considered parameter space the relative Monte Carlo statistical uncertainty remains very small, in the range of ca. 2-3%, whereas outside the region the uncertainty grows the further away the parameters lie from the input samples. This explains both the local maxima in the central parameter region and the rapid increase in the outer region.

For this channel the kinematic observable used is the azimuthal angle between the two leptons \(\Delta\phi_{II}\). All input distributions for morphing and validation are scaled their respective cross section in arbitrary units and shown in Figure 17. Two tests of the morphing method are covered. First the morphing to the input distributions is tested (cf. Figure 18). Since the validation samples are among the inputs a perfect agreement

Figure 14: Distributions of the \(\Delta\phi_{jj}\), the angle between leading and sub leading jet for events generated in the VBF \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) process at 13 TeV. Generated validation samples (solid) as well as predictions calculated via morphing (dashed) are shown. The ratio between morphing output and validation distribution is depicted in the lower panel.

Figure 16: The number of expected events in the considered parameter space for ggF \(H\to WW^{*}\to ev\mu\nu\) calculated with the morphing method is shown on the left. The relative Monte Carlo statistical uncertainty on the number of expected events propagated from the morphing function can be seen on the right.

Figure 15: Overview of produced samples for morphing validation in the ggF \(H\to WW^{*}\to ev\mu\nu\) channel. The SM couplings \(g_{Hgg}\) and \(g_{\rm{SM}}\) are set to 1 for all input samples and the limits for the BSM parameters are taken such that a pure BSM sample would have the SM cross section. The parameters for the validation samples are taken randomly in the desired parameter space.

is seen, as expected. Similar results are obtained for the other input samples and are not shown. Second the morphing is tested on statistically independent validation samples (cf. Figure 19), which shows reasonable agreement of the input samples and the morphing.

In addition, the fitting procedure is tested. When fitting to the SM or one of the other BSM input samples used as pseudo-data as shown in Figure 20, again a perfect agreement is obtained and the nominal parameter values are recovered. For comparison, the morphing result is also shown. The Monte Carlo statistical uncertainty is used both for display of the error bars and in the fit. The uncertainties on the fit parameters give an idea of the sensitivity on the parameter. The correlation between the parameters are shown in Table 11.

Figure 18: Validation of the morphing using input distributions. The SM distribution (left) and one input distribution (right) show perfect agreement as expected for statistically dependent samples.

The same fitting procedure is applied to the statistically independent validation distributions and is shown in Figure 21. the correlation for these fits are listed in Table 12.
