## 1 Introduction

The Technical proposal (TP) is a document to be submitted to the LHCC by-15 December 1994. It is meant to give a technical description of the ATLAS detector, its infrastructure, and its performance, as well as to address questions of the organization of the collaboration and the schedule of the detector construction. The page limit of the TP is 250 pages.

The text processing system which will be used to edit the ATLAS Technical Proposal is LaTeX. The layout of the TP follows (with some small modifications) the one of the ATLAS LoI. It uses the "twocolumn" style and a 10 point character size which allows for a maximum of about 1000 words on a single page.

An ATLAS specific document style (called ATLASPRO STY) has been created. This style is also used to produce this document, i.e., headings and text appear as in the TP.

The main editors for the TP are:

* Kevin Einsweiler (LBL Berkeley)
* EINSWEIER@LBL.GOV;
* Anthony Weidberg (Oxford)
* WEIDBERG@CERNVM; and
* Jorg Wotschack (CERN)
* WOTSCB@CERNVM.

They will help you in technical matters and try to ensure coherence in style and notations throughout the many contributions from many different authors.

The editing of the individual sections of the TP is the responsibility of the corresponding section editors:

The plan is to assemble the TP in three steps:

1. **Draft0:** a very detailed layout of the different sections is expected for 15 September.
2. **Draft1:** a full version of the TP, including (preliminary) figures. The deadline for contributions is 15 October. This version will not be proof-read allowing still for substantial changes to the text.
3. **Draft2:** the final version of the TP. The deadline for contributions is 15 November. Proof-reading will start. No major changes to the text are expected thereafter.

The document must be ready for printing around 10 December.

The text processing system LaTeX offers the advantage that it is machine independent. The same files can be processed on any machine (provided the LaTeX software is available, as it is on the most commonly used ones). Recently a new version of LaTeX, LaTeX2, has been introduced which accepts also the LaTeX format. You may use either version to process your files, but, please do not use any of the (nice) new features which are provided in LaTeX2\({}_{t}\). This is to ensure that the text can be processed, also in places where LaTeX2\({}_{t}\) is not yet installed.

The master copy of the files for the TP will reside on CERNVM. All official (accepted) TEX, DVI, PS files and templates will reside on disk PUBZP 215; all (accepted) figures on disk PUBZP 216.

This guide defines some style rules to help authors when preparing contributions to the TP. It is essential that notation be consistent and standardized so that contributions can be included efficiently into the TP:

* Use the templates provided by the editors for document style, etc.
* Use standardized symbols rather than your own constructs (e.g., luminosity units, \(\mbox{\it p}_{\mbox{\scriptsize T}}\), \(\mbox{\it H}\rightarrow\mbox{\it\boldmath$\gamma$}\), etc.). The currently defined symbols are listed in Section 6. They reside in the symbol file TP-DEFS TEX which can be found on PUBZP 215. (In the case that you are working on CERNVM, it is recommended to link to this disk, even during the early phase of writing, rather than to copy it to your private disk). If you need symbols which are not yet defined but of general interest, please notify the editors, they will add them tothe standard set.
* Do not use any explicit figure, table, section, citation numbers in the text, use variables (labels) instead (these will be automatically handled by LaTeX when figures, tables, etc are added or removed). Reference to figures, sections, etc. is made using the \ref{label} command.
* The \label{...} command is (in LaTeX jargon) fragile. To avoid problems, it is mandatory to include the \label{...} command in the argument of the sectioning commands or (for figures and tables) the \caption{...} command (see Section 4 for examples).
* Follow the naming conventions (Section 2) for figures, tables, sections, citations, etc. This will avoid duplication of names when sections of different authors are combined.
* A list with a few examples of commonly used expressions and their spelling (as accepted by the proofreaders), is provided in Section 5.6.
* Only machine-readable drawings, figures, etc. in encapsulated postscript format (EPS) will be accepted. Scanning of figures should be avoided; it will blow up the size of the PS files and printing will become very cumbersome.

Sections 4 and 5 follow closely the instructions for contributions to the Physical Review journal. Parts of these instructions have been reproduced, however, with some modifications to give preference to British spelling, etc.

### Preparing your TP contribution

## 3 Getting started

### Document assembly

To facilitate the assembly of the TP, the full document is split into a root file (TPn TEX ) and several INCLUDE files. The root file contains all MTEX instructions concerning documentstyle, fontsize, etc. It calls the following INCLUDE files:

* TP-DEFS TEX containing the definition of symbols and commands;
* TPn-xxxx TEX containing the text of the different sections.

The letter 'n' in TPn or TPn-xxxx stands for the TP version number (it will start with 0). The 'xxxx' stand for the different section names, see Table 2.1.

Each INCLUDE file contains the full text (in MTEX format) of the corresponding section, including the main section heading, but without the control instructions of the preamble (which you usually have at the beginning of your MTEX file before the \begin{document} instruction).

The bibliography should be part of each section and added at the end of it. To do this, use the following sequence:

\begin{tabular}{l} begin{thebibliography}{99} \\ \bibitem{...} \\ \bibitem{...}... \. \\ \end{tabular}

\end{tabular}

A set of (almost) empty INCLUDE files TP0-xxxxxx TEX with the corresponding main section headings (and in some cases example subheadings) is provided. At the end of each file the (empty) bibliography section has been added.

All files can be found on CERNVM on:

* PUBZ 215 for text files, and
* PUBZ 216 for figures.

These disks are WRITE PROTECTED and any update of the files should go via the editors once you have a working version on your A-disk.

### Example

As an example the ATLAS note MUON-NO-044 has been modified to become an INCLUDE file which could be a section of the \(\neg\)P. It gives examples of how to include figures, tables, and references. The INCLUDE file name is MDT-INCL TEX. It is called from the root file MDT-EX TEX which is organized like TPn TEX, except that it only calls MDT-INCL TEX. To run it, execute

LATEX MDT-EX

DVIPS MDT-EX.

The corresponding DVI and PS files and the TEX files and can be found on PUBZP 215.

### Preparing your TP contribution

Copy the corresponding INCLUDE file TP0-xxxx TEX from PUBZP 215 and insert your text. Once you have prepared the text for your section, proceed as follows:

On CERNVM: link to PUBZP 215 and 216 (GIME PUBZP 215  GIME PUBZP 216).

Copy the root file TP0 TEX from

the disk PUBZP 215 to your

A-disk or to your preferred

computer.

Copy (if needed) LaTeX style files

from CERNVM to your preferred

computer.

The ATLASPRO STT file used for the

layout of the TP can be found on

PUBZP 215, all others called herein,

on disk TEX 802 on CERNVM.

Modify the list of \incldoneonly{...} in

the file TP0 TEX in such a way that

only the section which you want to

process is called, i.e. remove the %

sign from the corresponding line.

Execute 'LaTeX TPO', it will pick

up just your INCLUDE file and

generate the file TP0 DVI,

then proceed as usual:

DVIPS TP0 to generate a PS file,

LWPINIT TP0.PS (PR name.

### Useful tricks

#### 3.4.1 Psdraft

Including figures into the text usually makes the PS files uncomfortably large. This results in problems with disk space and printing often becomes very long and tedious. For most of the text editing figures are not necessary at all. On the other hand it is nice to have them included in the document since their placement (by LaTeX) may considerably change the layout of the text and tables.

To include figures in the text without actually loading the content of the figures, use the 'pedraft' command after the 'begin(document)' command. To do so, just remove the % sign in front of the 'psdraft' line in TPn TEX. In this mode empty boxes with the correct size and position will be produced instead of the actual drawing. Of course, this will only work if the figures exist, in particular their 'BoundingBoxes' (see below).

If you want only some of your figures in draft mode you may use the

psdraft

...

psfull

sequence. Any figure called between these two commands will appear as an empty box.

#### 3.4.2 'Mini' EPS files

Working on machines other than CERNVM you may not want to copy all EPS files with the figures to your machine. If these files are big it may take very long and it fills up your disk space. This is in particular true during a phase where the contents of figures may change often. Again the PSdraft mode can help. If you run in this mode, LaTeX will only look for the first line of the EPS file (the one which starts with 'PS-Adobe...) and the one which contains the BoundingBox (usually the second line). It will ignore the rest. So it is sufficient to just copy these two lines. (Of course, like that you will never be able to see the full picture!).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

page. It will also require a "continued" caption (see above) for each additional page of the table.

#### 4.5.2 Captions

Each table that is not part of the text must have a descriptive caption. It should be placed above the table and be as concise as possible. The caption can consist of an abbreviated sentence (without a beginning article and/or verb) punctuated as a complete sentence. If it is made up of more than one sentence, treat it as a single paragraph. Displayed math is allowed within the caption, but the use of short mathematical expressions in broken-down form is preferred. Abbreviations and acronyms that pertain to the whole table should be defined in the caption. Those already defined in text need not be defined again.

#### 4.5.3 Lines and space

Lines and space are used to separate and define the integral parts of a table. They aid the eye and group information appropriately.

A simple table needs lines in only three locations: one line at the beginning and end of the table and two lines together separating the headings and columns of entries. A more complicated table, one made up of several parts and having more than one set of headings, will need additional space and lines. Each set of headings will require a line below it and extra space running horizontally above it to separate it from the preceding part of the table.

Use spacing also for grouping. Clear separation of one column and heading from another is created by inserting extra space running vertically between them.

Extra space running horizontally can be used to distinguish broad groups among the entries.

#### 4.5.4 Headings

There are two major kinds of headings used in tables:

1. column headings,
2. row headings.

Each type may contain or be made up of standard abbreviations. Always capitalize the first word or abbreviation in all headings and subheadings.

(1) _Column headings_ are separated from the body of the table by a horizontal line. They are usually dropped to the bottom of the heading area. However, units of measure that pertain to each entry in a whole column should be included i: parentheses and placed as the last entry in the heading on a line by itself or spaced off from the heading on the same line.

(2) _Row headings_ are read from left to right on one line. When used in the heading area they need a diagonal line to separate them from any column headings.

In the body of a table, row headings have similar form. They are read left to right with any units of measure enclosed in parentheses and separated by one space on the same line. To continue a row heading or indicate a row subheading, indent the second line.

#### 4.5.5 Entry lineup

The manner in which table entries are aligned in their columns will greatly affect the readability of a table. For this reason use one or a combination of the following types of alignments.

(1) _Flush left_. To be used in a situation where the entries are not similar and/or of different lengths. All entries are flush left with the column heading centred over the column.

(2) _Centre_. An alternative to (1). Each entry is centred with the column heading centred.

(3) _Lineup by digit and/or decimal_. To be used in a situation where all or most of the entries are numbers. Align according to digit and/or decimal placement.

(4) _Lineup by operator_. To be used in a situation where most entries are similar and have some kind of operator (multiplication, plus, minus signs, etc.) in common.

(5) _Lineup by unit_. To be used when the entries include different units of measurement. In other cases where all entries include the same unit, the unit designation should be removed from the column entries, enclosed in parentheses, and made part of the column heading. Lineup will then be by operator, decimal, and/or digit as appropriate.

(6) _Combination of lineups_. Whenever possible lineups (3), (4), and (5) should be used in conjunction.

### Figures

There are both style and technical considerations when preparing figures as part of the document. Keep the following technical suggestions and basic style requirements in mind when designing and composing figures.

#### 4.6.1 Types of figures

Only figures in encapsulated postscript format (EPS) will be accepted. Do not scan in figures (EPS files

## 5 Spelling and Abbreviation of Units

### Characters available

#### 5.1.1 Alphabets

There are two alphabets used conventionally: Greek and Latin (upper- and lowercase letters of each) in lightface and boldface. The Latin alphabet is available in five letter type fonts: roman (upright), italic (slanted), script (cursive), German (Praktur), and sans serif (unadorned).

Each alphabet and font has specialized uses. The two main Latin fonts, roman and italic, are used to create a distinction between words and mathematical symbols. Latin letters as mathematical symbols are conventionally printed in the italic font to distinguish them from the text material which is printed in the roman font. Below are listed specific uses for both alphabets and the fonts.

#### 5.1.1 Greek alphabet

Letters of the Greek alphabet are used to represent the following: some variables and constants, symbols for particles, some operators, and some units of measure. Note here that the Greek letter, not the word, is commonly used in most situations.

#### 5.1.1 Latin alphabet

Roman (upright) font: English words, abbreviations of words, chemical symbols and compounds, symbols for particles, most multiletter abbreviations (both on line and as subscripts and superscripts), units of measure, bold three-vector notation (e.g., \(k\)), most multiletter operators and functions (e.g., exp, ln), modes (e.g., TE, LO), shapes, data-run numbers, figure part labels [e.g., (a), (b), etc.], parts of apparatus, letters in periodic tables, letters in equation numbers [e.g., (1a), (1b)], figures, tables, section headings, section headings letters, and letters in enumerative lists.

_Italic_ (slanted) font: foreign words, words or phrases that indicate emphasis, variables, constants, most single-letter operators, axes and planes, channels, types (e.g., \(n\),\(p\)), bands, geometric points, angles, lines, chemical prefixes, symmetry designations, transitions, critical points, colour centres, quantum-state symbols in spectroscopy, and most single-letter abbreviations. In an alloy, the major constituent is italicized, the other chemical symbol is roman as usual, e.g., CuMn.

Script (cursive) font: variables and operators, constant, matrix elements, and some quarks.

German (Fraktur) font: variables.

Sans serif (unadorned) font: a few variables (S,T in tensor notation), shapes (e.g., L shaped), and a few operators.

Boldface type is reserved for indicating three-vectors and in some special cases matrices.

#### 5.1.2 Numbers

Numbers are printed in either the roman or italic font. Use the roman font for all numbers except those in published reference titles. These should be made italic.

### Grammar and punctuation

Good grammar and clear punctuation are essential to successful technical writing. Clear, simple sentence structure best presents scientific ideas.

#### 5.2.1 Text and math as sentences

1. Treat the text and mathematical formulas as an entity. Punctuate mathematical expressions as sentences or parts of sentences.

A slight rearrangement of terms then gives

\[D_{s}=\bar{\xi}_{s}X^{-1/2}-b, \tag{14}\]

where

\[X=4t\chi^{2}(-\ln t)/x^{2}, \tag{15}\]

\[\bar{\xi}_{s}=\xi_{s}/t^{1/2}, \tag{16}\]

and the reduced transition temperature \(t\) is defined to be \(T_{c}/T_{cs}\)..
2. Avoid beginning a sentence with a symbol if the sentence before it has ended with a symbol or number.

#### 5.2.2 Use of the comma

1. Do not surround a symbol with commas or parentheses when it immediately follows the noun that defines it, but do insert the commas or parentheses if another phrase intervenes.

As the temperatures approached the melting temperature \(T_{m}\), all... As the temperatures approached the melting temperature reported by Green _et al._, \(T_{m}\), all...
2. Please use the serial (Harvard) comma. See the example below, where the second comma is the serial comma.

### Spelling and hyphenation

Symmetry requires that \(\omega_{1}=\omega_{2}\), \(\omega_{3}=\omega_{4}\), and \(\omega_{5}=\omega_{6}\).
3. Place commas around etc., e.g., i.e., viz., namely, for example, that is, say, in particular, and respectively. Do not use commas around cf. or _et al._
4. Nonrestrictive clauses should be introduced by "which" and set off by commas.

The \(K=1\) component, which in this case does not influence the band shape, gives rise to...

#### 5.2.3 Use of parentheses

1. When inserting a parenthetical remark into a sentence do not punctuate what is within the parentheses. Recall that the Brown-Green theory (see Sec. II below) must still be tested.
2. A completely separate parenthetical remark is punctuated as a regular sentence or group of sentences except that everything including the ending punctuation is enclosed within the bracketing. (Recall that the Brown-Green theory is still to be tested.) Again we begin to evaluate...
3. Square brackets enclose a phrase that already contains parentheses. Recall that the Brown-Green theory [see Eq. (2)] is still to be...

#### 5.2.4 Use of the colon-

1. Phrases introduced by a colon do not begin with a capital letter. Furthermore, the lake has a natural noise centre source: a dam.
2. A complete sentence introduced by a colon may be, but need not be, capitalized. Finally, the energies of bound surface states are calculated by means of the "effective-Hamiltonian" technique: Let \(E_{eff}\) be defined by \(E_{-}-E_{eff}=G_{0}(E^{-1}-V)\). Finally, the energies of bound surface states are calculated by means of the "effective-Hamiltonian" technique: let \(E_{eff}\) be defined by \(E-E_{eff}=G_{0}(E^{-1}-V)\).
3. When more than one sentence is introduced by a colon capitalize the f.rst word. In order to tackle Eq. (A5) we introduce the following simplifications and approximations: (1) Each eigenmode in the band is excited by white noise. (2) No eigenmode beyond the band is excited. (3) Because the...
4. Do not use a colon after a form of the verb "to be" or between a verb or a preposition and its object.

The momenta of the three \(\alpha\) particles in the c.m. system are \(p_{1}\), \(p_{2}\), and \(p_{3}\). New values were obtained for the quantum cyclotron radius, the Debye shielding radius, and the plasma frequency.

### Spelling and hyphenation

In technical writing the proper spelling and hyphenation of words is a controversial point of style. In general, for nontechnical words refer to _The Oxford English Dictionary_ if a question of correct form arises. Use the first spelling if there is more than one correct version. A few examples of often used words and their preferred spelling is given in Section 5.6. A list of general spelling and hyphenation rules follows.

1. Use British, not American, spellings except in proper names.
2. Do not use contractions.
3. Numbers in text should be spelled out for (1-9) unless they are part of a series or have a unit.
4. Numbers using an exponential representation should be composed as \(a\cdot b^{\epsilon}\) using the vedot instruction.
5. To form the plural of numbers add s (1980s), to symbols add's (\(A\)'s), and to abbreviations add s (NMRs).
6. To form the possessive of names add's (apostrophe s), regardless of the number of syllables or final letter (Green's, Jones's, de Gennes's). After a plural word the possesive is formed by adding just apostrophe (the boys' coats).
7. Quote marks should distinguish between the one at the beginning and the one at the end of the quote; use the form: 'quote'.
8. Capitalize adjectives and nouns formed from proper names (Gaussian, Ohmic); however, lowercase the names of units (gauss), well-established particles (boson and fermion, but _not_ Pomeron), and minerals (scheelite).

9. Use small capitals to identify computer program names, designation of ionization states in atomic spectroscopy, and the names of logical operations; e.g., DWWCK, Fe ii, and or.
10. Avoid hyphens that serve no useful purpose, e.g., output, not out-put.
11. Prefixes and suffixes usually should be closed up (nonradioactive); but do not close them up if a double letter is produced (semi-infinite), when added to a proper noun (non-Fermi), when added to two or more words (non-time-dependent), or if closing up could change the meaning of the word (un-ionized). Chemical prefixes and suffixes should be hyphenated (_cis_-dimethylethylene) and so should numbers above 10 (11-fold, but twofold).
12. "Self" words, "free" words, and some "half" words should be hyphenated (self-consistent, worry-free, and half-life), but "like" words are closed up (spacelike) unless they become extremely long or cumbersome.
13. To prevent ambiguity and make reading easier, modifiers made up of two or more words can be hyphenated (wrong-signature points, 8-MeV data). Strings of modifiers can be sorted with a combination of short and long hyphens (two-particle-two-hole configuration).
14. A hyphen also can be used as a sorting agent in predicate adjectives of three or more words (... is face-centred-cubic).
15. Use a hyphen in written-out numbers of two words or more (twenty-five).
16. Use hyphens in the names of materials such as \(\beta\)-bras.

### Abbreviation rules

When creating or using abbreviations, keep the following guidelines in mind.

1. An abbreviation for a single word should be a shortened form of that word. It should be made up of lowercase roman letters and is almost always unpunctuated (obs for observed or av for average).
2. An abbreviation for a phrase (acronym) should include the initial letters of the words of the phrase in either capital or lowercase roman letters (DWBA for distorted-wave Born approximation, bcc for body-centred-cubic). Always use capital letters if you are abbreviating a proper name (BCS for Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer), and when creating acronyms.
3. When you are using an abbreviation of a proper name as a superscript or subscript, retain the initial capital letter (\(E_{Coul}\) or \(E_{C}\) for Coulomb).
4. Do not use multiletter abbreviations as mathematical variables. Use the conventional symbol instead, e.g., \(E_{K}\); not KE for kinetic energy.
5. Abbreviations should be defined the first time they are introduced in text, i.e.,

...to describe dislocation-mediated melting of two-dimensional (2D) crystals, we...

Thereafter it is acceptable to use the abbreviation without definition.

### Units

The use of metric units (of the _Systeme International_) is preferred (see Table 5.1). This system is based on the metre, second, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela. [See _The International System of Units_, Natl. Bur. Stand. (U.S.) Spec. Publ. 330 (U.S. GPO, Washington, D.C., 1977).]

1. Decimal multiples or submultiples of units are indicated by the use of prefixes. See Table 5.1 below. The combination of prefix and unit symbol is treated as a single symbol. For instance, such a combination can be raised to a power, i.e., cm\({}^{2}\). Compound units are written 1 g cm\({}^{2}\) or g cm\({}^{2}\) s\({}^{-2}\), with a thin space between unit parts. The form 6 J/cm\({}^{3}\)/s is ambiguous and unacceptable; write \[6\ \mbox{J}\ \mbox{cm}^{-3}\mbox{s}^{-1}\ \ \ \mbox{or}\ \ 6\ \mbox{J}/(\mbox{cm}^{3}\mbox{s}),\] if that is what is meant.
2. Most units have a single form for both singular and plural, i.e., \[1.0\ \mbox{cm}\ \ \ \mbox{and}\ \ \ 2.7\ \mbox{cm}.\]
3. Most symbols for units are printed in lowercase roman type without periods. Units derived from proper names, however, are written with initial capital letters, i.e., coulomb (C), weber (Wb).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:16]

## 6 Predefined Symbols

In the following tables you find a set of symbols for frequently used expressions. Please use these symbols rather than your own constructs.

Note that the symbols are case sensitive, i.e. they must be used exactly as indicated respecting usage of upper and lower case characters.

Table 6.1 gives some miscellaneous items, Table 6.2 kinematic variables, Table 6.3 some often used particle names, Table 6.4 particle decay processes, and Table 6.5 some of the most frequently cited journals.

Please let the TP editors know if you wish to have symbols added. They will be glad to do so. An up-to-date list of all currently defined symbols and their appearance in the text will be kept on CERNVM on PUBZP 215 in the file TP-SYMB PS.
