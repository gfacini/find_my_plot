# Performance of \(W/z\) taggers using UFO jets in ATLAS

The ATLAS Collaboration

The identification of boosted hadronic decays of \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons is a key technique for a variety of searches and measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. ATLAS has recently developed a new large-radius jet collection reconstructed from Unified Flow Objects (UFOs); these new objects improve the reconstruction of jet substructure variables used in boosted \(W/Z\) tagging. This note presents the performance of the \(W/Z\) taggers using UFO large-radius jets, based on both cuts on substructure variables and a deep neural network combining multiple jet substructure observables. Certain analyses can further benefit by using taggers defined to be decorrelated with respect to the jet mass; this decorrelation allows analyses to make use of mass sidebands or other strategies to better control their background estimates. Two different mass decorrelation techniques are presented: an analytical method using fixed-efficiency \(k\)-nearest neighbors regression, and a multivariate method using an adversarial neural network. The dependence of each tagger's performance on modeling-related effects is also studied.

## 1 Introduction

The identification of high-transverse-momentum (\(p_{\rm T}\)) hadronically decaying \(W/Z\) bosons using large-radius (large-\(R\)) jets is a key technique for various physics analyses at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), such as searches for heavy new particles decaying to \(W/Z\) bosons and measurements of Standard Model processes at the TeV energy scale [1, 2, 3]. ATLAS has recently developed a new particle-flow algorithm, "Unified Flow Objects" (UFOs) [4], which improves the reconstruction of the jet mass and other substructure variables used in \(W/Z\) taggers compared to calorimeter topological clusters widely used in Run-1 and Run-2 analyses. This note describes the \(W/Z\) taggers using large-\(R\) jets reconstructed from UFOs, hereafter called UFO jets. As with the previous \(W/Z\) taggers defined for jets reconstructed only from calorimeter topological clusters (referred to as LCTopo jets) [5, 6], both simple and complex taggers are studied. The simple tagger uses rectangular cuts on substructure variables, while the complex tagger combines several substructure variables using a machine learning (ML) algorithm, specifically a deep neural network, and cuts on the resulting discriminant. In previous studies, correlations were observed between the \(W/Z\) taggers and the jet mass observable. In particular, the ML-based tagger biased the background jet-mass distribution to be around the \(W/Z\) mass after applying the tagger, since it learned the expected signal mass shape. This can be problematic for physics analyses where the signal contribution is smaller than the background, as the background contribution around the \(W/Z\)-mass region is often estimated by assuming a smoothly falling distribution from the low- to high-mass sideband regions. Depopulation of the events in the mass-sideband regions makes it complicated to estimate the background in such a way. Some techniques to decorrelate the \(W/Z\) taggers from the jet mass observable were tested in Ref. [7]. In this note, similar approaches are tested with the new UFO jet \(W/Z\) taggers.

The note is organized as follows. A brief description of the ATLAS detector is found in Section 2. Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations used in the analysis are described in Section 3. The UFO jet reconstruction and the jet truth labeling used in the analysis are explained in Section 4. Following the tagger optimization studies in Section 5, the performances of the different taggers are compared in Section 6. The variation of the estimated performance depending on the physics modeling is also discussed in Section 6. Finally, the conclusions are found in Section 7.

## 2 ATLAS detector

The ATLAS experiment [8] at the LHC is a multipurpose particle detector with a forward-backward symmetric cylindrical geometry and a near \(4\pi\) coverage in solid angle.1 It consists of an inner tracking detector (ID) surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T axial magnetic field, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer. The inner tracking detector covers the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<2.5\). It consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and transition radiation tracking detectors. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements with high granularity. A steel/scintillator-tile hadronic calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (\(|\eta|<1.7\)). The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements up to \(|\eta|=4.9\). The muon spectrometer surrounds thecalorimeters and is based on three large superconducting air-core toroidal magnets with eight coils each. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 T m across most of the detector. The muon spectrometer includes a system of precision tracking chambers and fast detectors for triggering.

## 3 Monte Carlo simulation

This analysis is based on MC simulated proton-proton collision events. The center-of-mass energy is set at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. All events are passed through the complete ATLAS detector simulation based on GEANT4 [9]. The effect of multiple interactions in the same and neighboring bunch crossings (pileup) is modeled by overlaying the simulated hard-scattering event with inelastic proton-proton collision events generated with Pythia v8.186 [10] using the NNPDF2.3LO [11] set of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and the A3 set of tuned parameters [12], to reproduce the 2017 data-taking conditions.

Multijet production is used to define the background jets originating from light quarks or gluons. The leading-order (LO) matrix elements for dijet production are calculated with Pythia v8.230 [13] and matched to the parton shower algorithm. The NNPDF2.3LO PDF set and the A14 set of tuned parameters [14] are used. The modeling of fragmentation and hadronization is based on the Lund string model [15; 16]. This sample is used in the optimization studies in Section 5.

Alternative multijet MC samples are generated with Sherpa v2.2.5 [17]. The matrix element is calculated at LO for dijet events. The CT14NNLO PDF set [18] and the Sherpa default \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-ordered showering algorithm, based on the Catani-Seymour dipole factorization, is used [19; 20]. Two variations using different hadronization models are studied: one is the default cluster-based Sherpa hadronization model [21] (labeled as Sherpa hereafter), and the other is the Lund string model (labeled as SherpaLund).

For the nominal \(W/Z\)-boson signal sample used in the optimization studies in Section 5, high-mass sequential standard model [22]\(W^{\prime}\to WZ\to q\bar{q}q\bar{q}\) events are simulated with Pythia v8.235 with the NNPDF2.3LO PDF set and A14 tune with a \(W^{\prime}\) mass of \(m_{W^{\prime}}=2\) TeV and the cross section is reweighted to get a flat \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution. This MC sample is referred to as "nominal \(W^{\prime}\)". It is known that the final-state \(W/Z\) bosons are predominantly longitudinally polarized.

Additional sets of \(W^{\prime}\to WZ\to q\bar{q}q\bar{q}\) samples are generated to study the dependence of the \(W/Z\) taggers on the boson polarization in Section 6. The samples are generated as the nominal \(W^{\prime}\) sample but filters are applied to select either longitudinally or transversely polarized \(W/Z\) bosons (labelled as \(W_{\mathrm{long\text{-}pol.}}\) and \(W_{\mathrm{trans\text{-}pol.}}\), respectively).

The performance of the developed \(W/Z\) taggers is also studied in events simulating the SM production of \(W\to q\bar{q}^{\prime}\) and \(Z\to q\bar{q}\) in association with jets (collectively referred to as \(V\)+jets) using Sherpa v2.2.8. The NLO matrix elements for up to two partons, and LO for up to four partons, are calculated. The NNPDF3.0NNLO set of PDFs [23] is used. The standard cluster-based Sherpa hadronization model is used. Alternative \(V\)+jets events generated with Herwig++ v2.7.1 [24] at LO are also considered, using the UEEE5 tune [25] and CTEQ6L1 PDF set [26]. It uses the default cluster-based hadronization model in Herwig++.

## 4 Large-\(R\) jet reconstruction

### Jet reconstruction algorithm

Large-\(R\) jets are reconstructed from UFOs using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm implemented in the FastJet package [27] with the radius parameter \(R=1.0\). UFO is a new particle-flow algorithm recently developed in ATLAS [4] to combine standard particle-flow objects [28] and Track-Calo Clusters [29], which show better tagging results in the lower- and higher-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges, respectively. UFOs improve the reconstruction of substructure variables, such as the jet mass, \(m_{J}\), and the energy-correlation function ratio, \(D_{2}\)[30], and achieves the optimal tagging performance across the full kinematic range. The constituent subtraction + SoftKiller (CS+SK) in Ref. [4] and the soft-drop [31] jet grooming algorithm with \(z_{\mathrm{cut}}=0.1\) and \(\beta=1.0\) are applied to remove pileup and soft-QCD contributions to the jets. Correction factors for the energy and mass scales of the reconstructed jets are derived using MC simulation, calibrating the jets on average to the particle level [32]. Events with at least one UFO jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>200\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.0\) and \(m_{J}>40\) GeV are selected.

### Jet truth labeling

Truth level information in MC simulation is used to label a jet either as a "\(W(Z)\)-jet" signal if it is consistent with containing the full \(W\to q\bar{q}^{\prime}\) (\(Z\to q\bar{q}\)) decay, or a "bkg-jet" if it originates from QCD production of quarks and gluons. Such information is used to study the efficiencies of the taggers for these different categories, \(\epsilon_{\mathrm{sig}}^{\mathrm{rel}}=N_{\mathrm{sig}}^{\mathrm{pass}}/N_{ \mathrm{sig}}^{\mathrm{total}}\) and \(\epsilon_{\mathrm{bkg}}^{\mathrm{rel}}=N_{\mathrm{bkg}}^{\mathrm{pass}}/N_{ \mathrm{bkg}}^{\mathrm{total}}\), where \(N^{\mathrm{total}}\) is the number of events satisfying the selection cuts in Section 4.1 and the truth labeling requirements below, and \(N^{\mathrm{pass}}\) is the number of events passing the tagger requirement for each category in these events.

In this analysis the jet truth labeling has been improved with respect to previous studies in Refs. [5; 7] to reduce the generator-dependence of the labeling definition. For the labeling definition, truth large-\(R\) jets reconstructed from stable particles2 using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with \(R=1.0\) are used. No grooming algorithm is applied to the truth large-\(R\) jet; the truth label definition is therefore independent of the grooming algorithm under study. The truth large-\(R\) jet is matched to the UFO jet by requiring \(\Delta R<0.75\). For \(W(Z)\)-jets, a \(W\) (\(Z\)) boson from the MC "truth" record is required to be matched to the truth large-\(R\) jet within \(\Delta R<0.75\). Furthermore, the truth large-\(R\) jet mass is required to be greater than 50 GeV and the energy scale of the first \(k_{t}\)-declustering, \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\)[33], of the truth large-\(R\) jet has to satisfy:

Footnote 2: The stable particles are required to have a lifetime greater than 10 ps and muons and neutrinos are excluded as they only leave minimal energy within the calorimeter.

\[\sqrt{d_{12}}>55.25\cdot\exp\left(\frac{-2.34\times 10^{-3}}{\mathrm{GeV}}p_{ \mathrm{T}}\right)\;\mathrm{GeV}, \tag{1}\]

where \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is the truth-jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The \(W\)-jet truth label has an additional criterion of requiring that the number of \(B\) hadrons ghost-associated [34] to the truth large-\(R\) jet (\(\mathrm{N_{b}}\)) is zero, which is necessary in order to remove contamination from top-quark decays. The jets not satisfying the requirements above are labeled as bkg-jets. In this note, only multijet samples are used to study bkg-jets, and bkg-jets in \(W^{\prime}\) and \(V\)+jets samples are not considered. These requirements are optimized using the nominal \(W^{\prime}\) MC sample described in Section 3, to achieve an efficiency for jets matched to a truth \(W/Z\) boson of about 85% at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=200\) GeV and about 100% for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>700\) GeV, as shown in Figure 1. The two daughter quarks from \(W/Z\) decays are identifiedin the MC truth record. After the \(W\)-(\(Z\)-)jet truth labeling above, the fraction of jets containing both quarks within \(\Delta R<0.75\) is about 94%(90%) at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=200\) GeV and \(>98\%\)(96%) at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>300\) GeV, as shown by "qq matched" category in Figure 1. There are the other contributions in the low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region containing at most one daughter quark within \(\Delta R<0.75\), shown by "\(\leq 1\)q matched" category in Figure 1; these are also treated as signal \(W/Z\)-jets in this note. Several substructure variables of the truth large-\(R\) jet were tested and \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\) was found to be the best variable to enhance the fraction of jets containing both daughter quarks. These fractions were also studied in \(V\)+jets events simulated with Sherpa and Herwig++ MC generators described in Section 3, as well as in \(t\bar{t}\) events simulated by Powheg[35, 36, 37] interfaced toPythia8, and similar results are obtained across the different event topologies and MC generators considered, except for a small variation at low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) due to polarization differences. The truth-jet mass and \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\) distributions can be found in Appendix A.

## 5 Tagger optimizations

The optimizations of the different \(W/Z\) taggers are described in this section. The nominal \(W^{\prime}\) and Pythia multijet samples introduced in Section 3 are used as the signal and background samples, respectively. The UFO-jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for signal and background samples is reweighted to be almost flat, in order to optimize a tagger that performs well across the full \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range.

### Cut-based tagger

The first tagger studied in this note is based on rectangular cuts on substructure variables, optimized to achieve a flat 50% efficiency for \(W(Z)\)-jets independent of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). Several combinations of substructure variables were tested and the following three variables were found to provide the highest background rejection, \(1/\epsilon_{\mathrm{bkg}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\): the jet mass, \(m_{J}\), reconstructed by the four-vector sum of the UFOs contained in the jet

Figure 1: Fraction of jets in the \(W^{\prime}\) sample matched to a \(W\) or \(Z\) boson that pass the corresponding label criteria (All). The ratio panel shows the relative fractions corresponding to the truth definition used in this note for two quarks (qq matched) and at most one quark (\(\leq\)1q matched) matched categories.

after the grooming; the energy-correlation function ratio \(D_{2}\)[30] with \(\beta=1\); and the number of ID tracks with \(p_{\rm T}>500\) MeV ghost-associated with the jet before the grooming, \(n_{\rm trk}\). The same variables were also chosen in a previous study using LCTopo jets [6]. While \(D_{2}\) is used to enhance the two-prong substructure, \(n_{\rm trk}\) is used to suppress bkg-jets, especially those originating from gluons.

The optimal lower and upper cuts for \(m_{J}\) and the upper cuts for \(D_{2}\) and \(n_{\rm trk}\), as a function of the large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\rm T}\), are shown for the \(W\) tagger in Figure 2. They are chosen to achieve the highest bkg-jet rejection while keeping 50% efficiency for the signal jets, in each \(p_{\rm T}\) bin. A 6th order polynomial function is used to interpolate the cuts across the different \(p_{\rm T}\) bins. Unlike the study presented in Ref. [6], which used LCTopo jets, the optimal \(D_{2}\) cut is found to be almost independent of \(p_{\rm T}\), thanks to the good angular resolution of UFOs. The optimized tagger using \(m_{J}\), \(D_{2}\) and \(n_{\rm trk}\) variables is referred to as the "3-var tagger". The dependence of the \(\epsilon_{\rm sig}^{\rm rel}\) and \(\epsilon_{\rm bkg}^{\rm rel}\) on the cut value of the single variable of \(D_{2}\) (\(D_{2}\)-only tagger) is also studied in Section 6.

The optimal cuts for the \(Z\) tagger are provided in Appendix B.

Figure 2: (a) Upper and lower cuts on (b) \(D_{2}\) and (c) \(n_{\rm trk}\) for the optimal cut-based \(W\) tagger in bins of \(p_{\rm T}\), resulting in a signal efficiency of \(\epsilon_{\rm sig}^{\rm rel}=50\%\). The 6th order polynomial function is used to get smooth cut values as a function of \(p_{\rm T}\).

### Deep neural network tagger

Following the previous study in Ref. [5], the substructure variables listed in Table 1 are chosen as the inputs to a deep neural network (DNN) trained to separate \(W\)-jets from bkg-jets. More details of each variable are found in Refs. [5, 7].

The architecture of the network was chosen as the result of a hyperparameter optimization maximizing classification strength. A number of networks built with different sets of hyperparameters were considered and trained with the Adam optimizer [38], to minimize the binary cross entropy loss function, \(L_{\text{clf}}\). The network with the lowest loss function was chosen. As a result, three fully-connected 32 node dense layers with a tanh activation function and a single-node output layer with sigmoid activation implemented in Keras[39] and Tensorflow[40] are used in this analysis. The resulting DNN score is referred to as \(z_{\text{NN}}\).

The background rejection is improved with respect to the previous DNN tagger based on LCTopo jets by a factor of 2 to 4 depending on the value of \(\epsilon_{\text{sig}}^{\text{rel}}\) and the \(p_{\text{T}}\) range considered, as shown in Section 6.2, thanks to the improved substructure variable reconstruction capabilities of UFO jets.

### Mass-decorrelated taggers

Already after the cut on \(D_{2}\) the bkg-jet mass becomes slightly distorted, as shown in Figure 3. A more significant sculpting is seen after the cut on the DNN score yielding a bkg-jet shape quite similar to the \(W\)-jets. This sculpting makes it complicated to estimate the background contribution in some physics analyses. Two different approaches to decorrelate the tagger performance from the jet mass observable are shown in this section.

#### 5.3.1 Analytical mass decorrelation using a fixed-efficiency regression

The cut-based taggers in Section 5.1 are useful for some physics analyses, as the number of variables to be considered is smaller and it is therefore easier to understand systematic effects compared to ML-based taggers. It is therefore interesting to study strategies for decorrelating the jet mass with respect to the single other substructure variable \(D_{2}\) used in the tagger. A simple analytical method is introduced in this section. A fixed \(\epsilon_{\text{bkg}}^{\text{rel}}\) is computed in bins of \(\rho=\log(m^{2}/p_{\text{T}}^{2})\) and \(p_{\text{T}}\) for the \(D_{2}\) distribution, resulting in

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l} \hline Variable & Description & Reference \\ \hline \(D_{2}\), \(C_{2}\) & Energy correlation ratios & [30] \\ \(\tau_{21}\) & \(N\)-subjettiness & [41] \\ \(R_{2}^{\text{FW}}\) & Fox-Wolfram moment & [42] \\ \(\mathcal{P}\) & Planar flow & [43] \\ \(a_{3}\) & Angularity & [44] \\ \(A\) & Aplanarity & [45] \\ \(Z_{\text{cut}}\), \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\) & Splitting scales & [33, 46] \\ \(Kt\Delta R\) & \(k_{t}\)-subjet \(\Delta R\) & [47] \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

a two-dimensional profile as shown in Figure 4(a). The value of \(\epsilon_{\text{bkg}}^{\text{rel}}\) chosen in this note is 8%, which roughly corresponds to a signal efficiency of \(\epsilon_{\text{sig}}^{\text{rel}}=50\%\).

In order to determine its functional dependence, a two-dimensional regression fit using the \(k\)-nearest neighbors (\(k\)-NN) algorithm is performed as shown in Figure 4(b), yielding the distributions of \(D_{2}^{(8\%)}(\rho,p_{\text{T}})\). For each jet, a new observable:

\[D_{2}^{k\text{-NN}}=D_{2}-D_{2}^{8\%} \tag{2}\]

is defined. As shown in Figure 5, the mass sculpting by \(D_{2}^{k\text{-NN}}\) cuts is suppressed, in particular in the lower-\(p_{\text{T}}\) region.

As a benchmark point, the \(W/Z\) tagger is optimized to achieve 50% signal efficiency by using \(m_{I}\), \(D_{2}^{k\text{-NN}}\) and \(n_{\text{trk}}\) variables, which is referred to as the "\(k\)-NN 3-var tagger", using the same procedure as for the 3-var tagger in Section 5.1. The threshold for each variable is parameterized by the 6th order polynomial function. The dependence of \(\epsilon_{\text{sig}}^{\text{rel}}\) and \(\epsilon_{\text{bkg}}^{\text{rel}}\) on the cut value of the single variable of \(D_{2}^{k\text{-NN}}\) (\(D_{2}^{k\text{-NN}}\)-only tagger) is also studied in Section 6.

#### 5.3.2 Adversarial Neural Network

As in Ref. [7], a sophisticated mass-decorrelation technique based on machine learning algorithms is studied, namely adversarial neural networks (ANN) [48]. This is obtained by training an additional network, called the adversary, to compete with the DNN tagger described in Section 5.2. The adversary network is trained to infer the jet mass from the DNN score, by minimizing its own loss function \(L_{\text{adv}}\). In addition, the logarithm of the jet transverse momentum, \(\log(p_{\text{T}})\), is used as an auxiliary input variable to make the decorrelation task robust across the \(p_{\text{T}}\) spectrum.

Figure 3: Normalized jet mass distribution for bkg-jets before the cut (black line dark-gray shaded), compared with the same distributions after cuts on \(D_{2}\) (cyan dotted) and the DNN score \(z_{\text{NN}}\) (violet solid) to achieve \(\epsilon_{\text{sig}}^{\text{rel}}=50\%\), for (a) a lower \(p_{\text{T}}\) range of [500, 1000] and (b) a higher range of [2000, 3000] GeV. As a reference, the jet mass distribution for \(W\)-jets before tagging is also shown as a light-gray shaded histogram.

The loss function of the full adversarial neural network is then defined as:

\[\min_{\theta_{\rm cif}}\max_{\theta_{\rm adv}}L_{\rm clf}(\theta_{\rm clf})- \lambda L_{\rm adv}(\theta_{\rm clf},\theta_{\rm adv}), \tag{3}\]

where \(\theta\) denotes the tunable parameters (weights and biases) for each network. The parameter \(\lambda\) has to be chosen to balance the classification task with the decorrelation task. The adversary loss, \(L_{\rm adv}\), is only evaluated for bkg-jets because the mass decorrelation is defined with respect to the background.

A hyperparameter optimization is performed to maximize the metric \(1/\epsilon_{\rm bkg}^{\rm rel}+\lambda/{\rm JSD}\) with a fixed parameter \(\lambda=10\), where JSD is the Jensen-Shannon divergence with respect to the normalized mass distribution of

Figure 4: Optimal cut on \(D_{2}\) to achieve \(\epsilon_{\rm bkg}^{\rm rel}=8\%\) as a function of \(\rho\) and \(p_{\rm T}\) (a) before and (b) after the \(k\)-NN fit.

Figure 5: Normalized jet mass distribution for bkg-jets before the cut (black line dark-gray shaded), compared with the same distributions after cuts on \(D_{2}^{k\text{-NN}}\) (cyan dotted) and a classifier score of the ANN tagger \(z_{\rm ANN}\) (violet solid) to achieve \(\epsilon_{\rm sig}^{\rm rel}=50\%\), for (a) a lower \(p_{\rm T}\) range of [500, 1000] GeV and (b) a higher range of [2000, 3000] GeV. As a reference, the jet mass distribution for \(W\)-jets before tagging is also shown as a light-gray shaded histogram.

bkg-jets before and after the cut on the classifier [49], while \(\epsilon_{\text{bkg}}^{\text{rel}}\) is the efficiency for bkg-jets. A value of \(\lambda=10\) was found to be optimal in previous studies [7], and thus serves as a reasonable baseline; the re-optimization of the value of \(\lambda\) is then performed in a second stage, explained later in this section.

The JSD metric is confined to the range \([0,1]\) with smaller values indicating a smaller relative entropy between the jet mass distributions before and after the tagging i.e. a better degree of mass decorrelation. In each step of the optimization, the cut on the classifier output to achieve \(\epsilon_{\text{sig}}^{\text{rel}}=50\%\) is obtained and the corresponding \(\epsilon_{\text{bkg}}^{\text{rel}}\) and JSD values are computed. The result of the adversary optimization is an adversary network comprised of a single fully connected layer with 64 nodes and a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation [50], which is connected to an encoded Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with 20 components, leading to a single-node output with a sigmoid activation function.

The training of the combined network is performed in several steps. After the classifier is trained alone as described in Section 5.2, the \(L_{\text{adv}}\) is added and trained to infer the mass from the classifier output. In this step, the classifier is fixed and only the adversary is optimized. After this "pretraining" procedure, both models are optimized together with the combined objective in Equation 3. Finally, the classifier output obtained after training the whole network can be used as a discriminant.

As a consequence of Equation 3, a larger value of the \(\lambda\) parameter improves the mass decorrelation, but deteriorates the classifier performance. In order to find the best compromise, different values are tested. Figure 6 shows the resulting background rejections and JSDs for the cut on the classifier output as a function of \(p_{\text{T}}\) for several \(\lambda\) choices, at fixed values of \(\epsilon_{\text{sig}}^{\text{rel}}=50\%\) and \(80\%\). With low \(\lambda\) values, the bkg-jet mass distribution after the tagging shows a certain degree of distortion. The JSD value is improved by increasing the \(\lambda\) value up to 7, and from \(\lambda=10\) it reaches a plateau and becomes stable. For higher values of \(\lambda\), the background rejection is reduced without further improvement in mass decorrelation. A choice of \(\lambda=10\) is thus considered to be the best choice, and is thereby used as the default value of \(\lambda\) going forward. The classifier score of the ANN tagger is referred to as \(z_{\text{ANN}}^{(\lambda=10)}\). The bkg-jet mass distribution after tagging with \(\lambda=10\) is presented in Figure 5.

## 6 Comparison of the different taggers and configurations

In this section, for simplicity, only the \(W\)-tagger performance is shown. For signal samples, only \(W\)-jets are considered. A demonstration of the application of taggers designed for \(W\)-jets as applied to \(Z\)-jet signals is provided in Appendix C. The taggers are optimized or trained in Section 5 using the nominal \(W^{\prime}\) signal and Pythia multijet samples. The performance of the taggers for the samples used in the optimization and training studies is shown in Section 6.1. In Section 6.2, the performance of the DNN and ANN taggers using UFO jets is compared with those using LCTopo jets. Section 6.3 extends the performance comparisons to MC samples which the taggers were not trained for, as is relevant when applying the taggers in different analyses with different types of processes and final states. In this section, the large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions for all samples are reweighted to reproduce the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution for the nominal Pythia multijet sample.

Figure 6: Variations of bkg-jet rejection \(1/\epsilon_{\mathrm{bkg}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) and mass decorrelation \(1/\mathrm{JSD}\) of the ANN taggers as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) depending on the \(\lambda\) parameter, for the \(\epsilon_{\mathrm{sig}}^{\mathrm{rel}}=50\%\) (left) and \(80\%\) (right) working points. Results with \(\lambda=1\), \(3\), \(5\), \(7\), \(10\) and \(30\) are shown. Increasing the value of \(\lambda\) results in a deterioration in the bkg-jet rejection, and an improved mass decorrelation, up until a value of \(\lambda=10\).

### Comparison of different taggers

Figures 7(a)-7(b) compare the signal efficiency \(\epsilon_{\rm sig}^{\rm rel}\) and bkg-jet rejection \(1/\epsilon_{\rm bkg}^{\rm rel}\) for cuts applied on \(D_{2}\), \(D_{2}^{k\text{-}\text{NN}}\), the DNN score \(z_{\rm NN}\) (without mass decorrelation) and the classifier score of the ANN tagger \(z_{\rm ANN}^{\rm\pm 10}\). Lower- and higher-\(p_{\rm T}\) ranges are shown and no additional mass cut is applied.

The \(D_{2}^{k\text{-}\text{NN}}\)-only tagger shows better bkg-jet rejection than the \(D_{2}\)-only tagger, because the rejection for the mass-sideband events is improved by the translation of \(D_{2}\to D_{2}^{k\text{-}\text{NN}}\). The DNN tagger shows the best performance in both \(p_{\rm T}\) ranges, with a bkg-jet rejection of up to 10 times better than the \(D_{2}\)-only tagger, depending on the signal efficiency. As discussed in Section 5.3.2, classification performance can be exchanged for better mass decorrelation, leading to a bkg-jet rejection of the ANN tagger that is worse than the DNN tagger and which is at the same level as the \(D_{2}^{k\text{-}\text{NN}}\)-only tagger. This demonstrates that the DNN mainly learns the correlation of each substructure variable with the jet mass, and not a correlation between substructure variables.

Figure 7(c)-7(d) shows the same distributions but with the \(p_{\rm T}\)-dependent mass-window cut of Figure 2 applied in addition to the tagger under study for the numerator in the calculation of \(\epsilon_{\rm sig}^{\rm rel}\) and \(\epsilon_{\rm bkg}^{\rm rel}\). This allows for a fair comparison between the taggers around the \(W/Z\) mass. The signal efficiencies and background rejections of the 3-var tagger in Section 5.1 are also shown. It is found that the difference in bkg-jet rejection between the four discriminants is smaller when the requirement on the jet mass is included, and they are close to that of the 3-var tagger. The DNN tagger still performs better than the ANN tagger, especially in the high-\(p_{\rm T}\) region.

Figure 8 shows \(1/\epsilon_{\rm bkg}^{\rm rel}\) of the taggers as a function of \(p_{\rm T}\) at a fixed \(\epsilon_{\rm sig}^{\rm rel}=50\%\). The 3-var and \(k\)-NN 3-var taggers defined in Sections 5.1 and 5.3.1 are also shown. The mass-window in Figure 2 is also applied for the numerators in this figure. The performance of the 3-var tagger is almost equivalent to the \(k\)-NN 3-var tagger, as expected, since \(D_{2}^{k\text{-}\text{NN}}\) is a simple translation of the \(D_{2}\) variable in each \(p_{\rm T}\) and mass region. The bkg-jet rejections of the 3-var taggers are slightly better than the DNN tagger, while the DNN tagger is significantly better than \(D_{2}\)-only and \(D_{2}^{k\text{-}\text{NN}}\)-only taggers. The \(n_{\rm trk}\) information used in the 3-var taggers is not used in the ML studies. This demonstrates that \(n_{\rm trk}\) provides complementary information and its inclusion could improve the DNN and ANN taggers in future iterations.

### Comparison with the LCTopo jet taggers

The performance of the DNN and ANN \(W\) taggers using the UFO jets as developed in this note is compared to those using the LCTopo jets in Ref. [7]. It is challenging to make direct quantitative comparisons to the previous result, as the truth labeling strategy and selection cuts have been updated in this note. In order to mitigate these differences, this section uses the same truth labeling and selection cuts as in Ref. [7] also for UFO jets. For the truth labeling, the trimming grooming algorithm [51] is applied to the truth large-\(R\) jet matched to the UFO jet within \(\Delta R<0.75\) and both daughter quarks are matched to the truth large-\(R\) jet within \(\Delta R<0.75\). The UFO jet mass is required to be \(m_{J}>40\)\(\mathrm{\text{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}}\) instead of \(50\)\(\mathrm{\text{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}}\). The efficiencies for signal and background, \(\epsilon_{\rm sig}^{\rm rel}\) and \(\epsilon_{\rm bkg}^{\rm rel}\), are recomputed with the requirements above. Figure 9 shows the \(\epsilon_{\rm sig}^{\rm rel}\) and \(1/\epsilon_{\rm bkg}^{\rm rel}\) of the DNN and ANN taggers for the UFO jets compared to those for the LCTopo jets. The \(1/\epsilon_{\rm bkg}^{\rm rel}\) for the taggers using UFO jets, for \(\epsilon_{\rm sig}^{\rm rel}=50\%\), is improved by a factor of roughly 3 for both the low- and high-\(p_{\rm T}\) range for the DNN taggers, and a factor of roughly 2.5 for the ANN taggers.

### Sensitivity to physics modeling

It is preferable to design taggers which are robust against differences related to physics modeling, and especially the modeling of soft QCD contributions. To evaluate the dependence of a tagger on modeling effects, events simulated with Sherpa described in Section 3 are compared with the nominal Pythia samples. For background events, this is further supplemented by studying different hadronization/fragmentation algorithms through the comparison of Sherpa and SherpaLund samples introduced in Section 3. For signal events, the performance of the taggers for events simulated with the Herwig++ generator is also tested.

It is known that the \(W\)/\(Z\)-tagging efficiency strongly depends on the boson polarization [5]. The signal

The \(\epsilon_{\text{sig}}^{\text{rel}}\) and \(\epsilon_{\text{big}}^{\text{rel}}\) of the 3-var tagger is also shown by green dots. Middle panels show the ratio of \(1/\epsilon_{\text{big}}^{\text{rel}}\) for the mass-decorrelated taggers (\(D_{2}^{k\text{-NN}}\) and ANN) to that for non-decorrelated taggers (\(D_{2}\) and DNN). Bottom panels show the ratio of \(1/\epsilon_{\text{big}}^{\text{rel}}\) for the DNN tagger to \(D_{2}\)-tagger, and that for the ANN tagger to \(D_{2}^{k\text{-NN}}\) tagger.

efficiency is therefore compared between \(W_{\text{long-pol.}}\) and \(W_{\text{trans.-pol.}}\) samples introduced in Section 3, in order to study this dependence.

Figure 10 shows the ratios of \(1/\epsilon_{\text{bkg}}^{\text{rel}}\) and \(\epsilon_{\text{sig}}^{\text{rel}}\) of the 3-var tagger for the various MC simulations with respect to the nominal Pythia multijet and the nominal \(W^{\prime}\) samples, respectively, as a function of \(p_{\text{T}}\). In Figures 11 and 12, the same distributions for the DNN and ANN taggers are shown, respectively, for fixed signal efficiencies of 50% and 80% as defined with respect to the nominal \(W^{\prime}\) sample.

Since the nominal \(W^{\prime}\) sample has predominantly longitudinally polarized \(W/Z\) bosons in the final state, the

For each \(p_{\text{T}}\) bin, \(1/\epsilon_{\text{bkg}}^{\text{rel}}\) is evaluated at a \(p_{\text{T}}\) value corresponding to the average \(p_{\text{T}}\) of the events in that bin.

Figure 9: Comparison of the performances of the DNN and ANN taggers using the UFO jets with those using LCTopo jets in (a) \(500<p_{\text{T}}<1000\) GeV and (b) \(1000<p_{\text{T}}<2000\) GeV. In order to perform a direct quantitative comparison the same truth labeling and preselection cuts (\(m_{J}>50\) GeV) are applied as used in Ref. [7].

performance of each tagger on the \(W_{\text{long-pol}}\) sample is quite similar to the nominal performance. When the taggers are applied to the \(W_{\text{trans.pol}}\) sample, the signal efficiency drops by about 20% for the 3-var tagger, about 15% for the DNN and ANN taggers for the 50% working point and about 8% for the 80% working point independently of \(p_{\text{T}}\).

Transversely polarized \(W/Z\) bosons are preferentially produced in SM \(V\)+jets events. Generally, the efficiencies for \(W\)-jet signals in SM \(V\)+jets samples are lower than the nominal \(W^{\prime}\) sample, and closer to \(W_{\text{trans.pol.}}\). The Herwig++ sample has about 10% lower efficiency than Sherpa. Similar parton shower algorithms are used for the Pythia and Sherpa simulations, which explains why the efficiency for Sherpa is more similar to the \(W_{\text{trans.pol.}}\). For the 3-var tagger, the efficiency for the Sherpa sample depends on \(p_{\text{T}}\), and it is lower than the efficiency for Herwig++ in the higher-\(p_{\text{T}}\) region. This is expected to come from the NLO/LO difference on the \(m_{J}\) distribution and its dependence on \(p_{\text{T}}\). Since no mass cut is applied for Figures 11 and 12, this trend is not present.

Differences in \(1/\epsilon_{\text{bkg}}^{\text{rel}}\) between Sherpa and Pythia samples are found to be within 20% for all taggers, depending on \(p_{\text{T}}\). It is decreased in the higher-\(p_{\text{T}}\) region and less than 10% for \(p_{\text{T}}>1\text{ TeV}\). The difference between Sherpa and SherpaLund samples is found to be smaller than 5%, which shows that hadronization models have a small impact on the tagging performance.

Even with the new UFO jets and new grooming algorithm discussed in Section 4.1, it is found that large differences in performance across different generators are still present, which will lead to large systematic uncertainties in some physics analyses as discussed in Ref [6] when studying similar effects for LCTopo jets with the trimming algorithm. For the 3-var tagger, in Ref. [6], the \(W\)-tagging efficiency was studied by using \(W\)-jet signals from top-quark decays. The physics modeling was evaluated by comparing Powheg and MadGraph5_MC@NLO[52]\(t\bar{t}\) samples, Pythia8 and Herwig7[53] parton shower algorithms and different ISR/FSR parameters. The estimated variation was 10-20%, which is compatible with the results in this note using UFO jets comparing Sherpa and Herwig++ \(V\)+jets samples. For background rejection, the Pythia multijet sample, which is the same as the one used in this note, was compared with the Sherpa v2.2.1 sample. In Ref. [6], a difference of about 20% was reported between Pythia and Sherpa samples. This generator difference is reduced in this study by using the newer version of Sherpa v2.2.5, in the high-\(p_{\text{T}}\) region. The difference is increased in the lower-\(p_{\text{T}}\) region. Different truth labeling and event selection cuts are used for the two studies, which can be the cause of the difference. More studies along the lines of those discussed above, where effects are split between parton shower, hadronization, and matrix element differences, could be used to further understand the origin of modeling differences. Dedicated calibrations could then be derived to mitigate these large systematic uncertainties, thereby benefiting future analyses.

\(W\)-jets and it mainly learns the jet mass variable, as discussed in Section 6.1. The difference between \(W\)- and \(Z\)-jets is much smaller for the ANN tagger. The mass decorrelation works well to identify both \(W\)- and \(Z\)-jet signals, which have a similar substructure except for their mass. For \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>500\GeV\), where the truth labeling efficiencies for both \(W\)- and \(Z\)-jets reach 100% as discussed in Section 4.2, the difference of \(1/\epsilon_{\mathrm{bkg}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) as a function of \(\epsilon_{\mathrm{sig}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) between \(Z\)-jets and \(W\)-jets is found to be within 2-10%, depending on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). This demonstrates that the mass-decorrelated tagger has the potential to increase the sensitivity in searches for boosted new particles, which decay into two quarks and form large-\(R\) jets, regardless of their masses.
