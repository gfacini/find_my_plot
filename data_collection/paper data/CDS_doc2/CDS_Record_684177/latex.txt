The cosmic ray hodoscope

The hodoscope is made of three planes of RPC that cover a surface of \(288\times 124\) cm\({}^{2}\). The distance between the lower two planes is 12 cm. These are positioned on a movable chariot and are separated by 5.5 cm of lead. The third plane, at a distance of 2.4 m from the middle plane, is positioned on top of a rigid structure made of iron square tubes.

The structure can house up to three MDT chambers: each MDT chamber is inserted in a frame made of square iron tubes which can be positioned, using the crane, on a movable low friction drawer, supported by horizontal beams. Reference marks insure positioning of the MDTs with an accuracy of 0.1 mm. The same frames will be used for transportation of the MDTs and will be mounted, up to three at a time, on a chariot equipped with pneumatic shock absorbers.

A photograph of the hodoscope is shown in figure 1. In the picture the x axis is horizontal parallel to the drift tubes, the y axis is vertical upwards and the \(\phi\) angle is in the x-y plane, for consistency with the ATLAS reference frame.

## 3 Resistive plate chambers

Each plane of the hodoscope is made of two adjacent RPCs of dimensions \(14\,0\times 124\) cm\({}^{2}\) with the electrodes segmented in strips normal to the drift tubes of 2.9 cm pitch. One end of the strips is connected to the electronics board while the other is terminated on the strip characteristic impedance. One electronics board [4] receives the signals from 16 adjacent strips. It contains the amplifiers and discriminators, a shift register where the discriminated signals are loaded upon receipt of an external command and the logic to form a fast-OR ECL signal. This is splitted on the board and sent via twisted pair cables to an ECL-to-NIM converter to form the trigger and to a TDC.

The RPCs are operated with a 1:1 Argon-Tetrafluorethane gas mixture with the addition of a small fraction of isoButane (\(48\%Ar-48\%C_{2}H_{2}F_{4}-4\%iC_{4}H_{10}\)). Mass gas flowmeters insure the stability of the gas mixture at the level of \(10^{-2}\).

A remotely controlled high voltage supply is used to power the RPCs. It provides independent settings of voltage, rump speed, current and time-of-over-current limit with a fast trip if these are exceeded. The system is controlled with a serial link connected via a VME bus to the data acquisition CPU.

The RPC are operated in saturated mode. Figure 2 shows for the middle plane the ratio \(\varepsilon\) of the threefold to twofold coincidence as a function of the high voltage setting. A clear plateau is observed at a value \(\varepsilon\approx 97\%\) for voltages larger than 8000 V. Taking into account the dead area due to the spacers and small solid angle effects, the efficiency is very close to 1. The working point was fixed at 9000 V to insure also a good time resolution (see section 6).

Trigger

The trigger is done starting from the RPC fast-OR signals. These are converted from ECL to NM levels and shaped 100 ns in width. Each trigger plane is divided into six slices of \(46\times 124\) cm\({}^{2}\), each slice corresponding to 16 strips. The plane signal is the OR of the six slices. We have set up two different triggers (see figure 3). A large acceptance trigger, LT, made with the coincidence of the three planes, selects an aperture of \(\Delta\phi\approx\pm 40^{\circ}\) around the vertical. A tight acceptance trigger, TT, made with the OR of the six threefold coincidences defines vertical sectors with aperture \(\Delta\phi\approx\pm 12^{\circ}\).

The LT rate is about 80 Hz and the TT rate about 20 Hz in good agreement with a simulation program based on information on cosmic ray fluxes at sea level [5]. The timing of the threefold coincidences is defined by the fast-OR signals of the bottom plane delayed by about 16 ns.

## 5 Data acquisition

The data acquisition system is based on the VME-bus and uses an Unix CPU 1. A VME crate contains a 32-channel TDC module [6] with 1 ns least count, to digitize the time of the RPC fast-OR signals, and a FIFO-memory board [7] to read out the strip pattern. The interface to the high voltage supply and other modules to read the gas flowmeters and temperature are housed in the same crate. A VME CPU, an on-line computer and a run-control machine have been setup to collect data.

Footnote 1: Digital AxpVME 233

Specific portable software has been written in ANSI-C in order to initialize and collect the information from the front-end electronics. The initialization and the readout phase take place by exploiting the VME protocol. A VME access library [8] has been developed in such a way that also this part of the software is portable.

Two software processes, the Collector and the Sender, run asynchronously with respect to each other on the VME CPU and manage the read-out activity. The Collector, beyond the initialization, is in charge of reading back the information from all the DAQ VME boards and building up the event. Afterwards it pushes the data frames in a shared memory with a FIFO structure. The Sender retrieves from the queue a predetermined number of events and dispatches them to the on-line computer through an ethernet connection using TCP/IP protocol.

Figure 3: The two trigger logics implemented starting from the 18 fast-OR signals.

On the on-line computer, two software processes, the Receiver and the Data Archiver, manage the read-out activity. The Receiver retrieves events from the TCP/IP connection and dispatches them to the Data-Archiver. A shared memory is again used to decouple the Receiver from the Data-Archiver. Monitoring functions are also implemented on the on-line computer by letting the monitoring process access the shared memory which decouples the Receiver from the Data Archiver. Finally a Run-Control program runs on the run-control machine and coordinates all the processes by dispatching them informations using CM protocol [9].

## 6 Timing and tracking

The performance of the hodoscope was studied using the strip pattern and the fast-OR TDC information. A first adjustment of the relative delays of the signals was done using the TT trigger. Then with the LT trigger the relative timing of the six sectors was adjusted within 1 ns. The trigger time resolution was evaluated studying the relative delay of the twofold coincidences within each sector. Figure 4 shows a typical \(\Delta t\) distribution with an r.m.s. width of 1.4 ns. Figure 5 shows the behavior of the r.m.s. width, divided by \(\sqrt{2}\), as a function of the high voltage setting for three different vertical sectors.

The working point was set to achieve \(\sim\) 1 ns time resolution. Thanks to the delay on the bottom plane signals the timing is always defined by the same plane, therefore there is no worsening introduced by the threefold coincidence as was checked using the simulation program.

The contribution to the resolution due to the transit time of the signals along the RPC strips was evaluated with the simulation program. A coarse measurement of the signal velocity along the strips was done using a pair of scintillators and a value of 24 cm/ns was obtained in agreement with the characteristics of the strip transmission line. With this value, a small improvement of the time resolution is expected for inclined tracks. Actually this effect will be corrected on an event by event basis using the extrapolation of the trajectory measured by the MDTs.

To reject showering particles we selected "clean" events with one and only one strip per plane. Though more refined cluster algorithms can be implemented, we checked that the number of selected events was not reduced by a large factor. Using three point tracks the space resolution of the RPCs is about 0.8 cm. A simple test on a three point \(\chi^{2}\) estimator using both the strip and the TDC information was further used to clean the sample. About 85% of the triggered events are accepted by the software selection, both for LT and TT triggers. Figure 6 shows the angular distribution of the tracks selected by the LT and TT trigger respectively. The final selection of stiff tracks will be done using the information of the MDT chambers, providing a much better angular resolution.

## 7 Simulation

For the optimization of the hodoscope design a simple Monte Carlo, generating cosmic ray muons and tracking them through the materials, was used. The main ingredients of the simulation are

for the generator:

* the cosmic rays flux of \(\approx 160\;m^{-2}s^{-1}\);
* the cosmic rays angular distribution with respect to the vertical axis, uniform in azimuth and depending on the square of the cosine of the polar angle;
* the cosmic rays momentum spectrum, taken from the empirical distribution of reference [5]. Figure 7 shows the momentum spectrum selected by the trigger;

for the tracking:

* the energy loss in the lead absorber and in the aluminum of MDTs;
* the multiple scattering in the same material;

for the detector response:

* the RPCs size and position;
* the RPCs strip size, \(2.9\,\)cm;

Figure 7: The momentum spectrum of the tracks selected by the trigger* the RPCs time resolution, 1 ns;
* the signal velocity along the RPCs strips, 24 cm/ns;
* the relative delays of the RPCs planes in the trigger logic;
* the TDC resolution.

This simulation provides a reasonable description both of the rates and the distributions of the data collected with the hodoscope, as shown in figure 6, and can be used to compute the rate for MDTs tests. Figure 8 shows the distributions in position and angle of the events we expect to collect using LT and TT triggers in one minute of data taking.

For a better description of the data, in view of the high statistics we will collect with MDTs within this system, we are setting up a full GEANT 4 [10] simulation of the hodoscope (see figure 9), based upon mtgeant-4 program [11]. This simulation provides also a full description of the MDT chambers and will be used to tune the selection of stiff tracks based on the MDT multilayers information.

## 8 Conclusions

Extensive studies performed using muon beams have shown that a sample of the order of \(10^{4}\) stiff tracks per tube is needed in order to achieve a stable self-calibration providing informations on the drift properties of MDTs. Moreover these tracks must be spread over a large range (at least \(\pm 5^{o}\)) in the \(\theta_{y}\) angle, projection of the polar angle on the y-z plane.

The RPCs hodoscope designed for the test of BIL chambers provides the full coverage of three chambers, with a 1 cm knowledge of the second coordinate of the track and 1 ns trigger time resolution. In 24 hours of data taking with TT trigger between \(3\times 10^{4}\) and \(1.5\times 10^{5}\) tracks can be collected per tube (see figure 8) for side and central tubes respectively.
