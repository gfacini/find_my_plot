## Abstract

The longitudinal structure of the hadronic end-cap calorimeter (HEC) is optimized for \(\mu\) detection. For this purpose the pile-up noise was calculated for each cell at 5 values of \(\eta\) (1.8, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 3.1) using about 1000 simulated minimum bias events generated by DICE (version 95-6). The electronic noise was also taken into account with two sets of data, 0.33 MIP and 0.5 MIP, for segments of 16 cells. Comparing the signals from \(\mu\)-mesons (\(\mu\) signal) with those from the pile-up and the electronic noise, an optimum longitudinal segmentation of the HEC (8+16+32) was found. In this case the signal to noise ratio for the two data sets of electronic noise is: (1.17,1.09; 3.06,2.57; 6.67,4.75) at \(\eta\)=1.8-1.9, (0.98,0.91; 2.60,2.34; 6.24,4.36) at \(\eta\)=2.5-2.6 and (0.74,0.73; 1.00,0.98; 3.19,2.84) at \(\eta\)=3.1-3.2. For all calculations a lateral granularity of \(\Delta\eta\)x\(\Delta\varphi\)=0.1x0.1 was assumed. Though the \(\mu\) position was chosen exactly at the center of the corresponding (\(\eta\),\(\varphi\)) cells, a part of the deposited energy leaks to the neighbouring cells. The amount of these losses is about 4% of the total deposited energy of the \(\mu\)-meson.

Introduction

The high luminosity of LHC [1] will result in a pile-up of about 23 minimum bias events per bunch crossing, which makes the separation of the \(\mu\) signal problematic. In the 2 mm wide LAr gaps of the HEC the ionization charge is collected during a time, which is much longer then the 25 ns between bunch crossings. To estimate the noise for a \(\mu\) signal under these conditions, it is very important to take into account not only the additional signals from pile-up interactions (so called static pile-up noise) but also all signals from about 40 preceeding bunch crossings with suitable weights, given by the shaping function of the front-end electronics. The problems of evaluation of the pile-up noise in LAr calorimeters at LHC have been discussed in [2-5]. An additional problem for the detection of a weak \(\mu\) signal in the HEC arises from the electronic noise.

## 2 Geometry and calculation procedures

To study the pile-up noise, we used 1000 simulated minimum bias events generated by DICE (version 95-6). The number of events during each bunch crossing was generated according to a Poisson distribution with a mean value of 23. Signals from \(\mu\)'s with an energy of 100 GeV were simulated at 5 values of \(\eta\) (1.85, 2.05, 2.55, 3.05 and 3.15) and at \(\varphi\)=3.19, which corresponds to the projective center of the cells. This was done to minimize losses of deposited energy into neighbouring cells. However, it is necessary to remark that in reality the HEC geometry is not a projective one. This creates additional problems in the \(\mu\) signal identification.

The structure of the hadron calorimeter absorber elements (ABE) was assumed to consist of 25 mm copper and of 8 mm LAr. In this investigation we did not take into account EST and signal boards. The lateral granularity was chosen as \(\Delta\eta\)x\(\Delta\varphi\)=0.1x0.1 for all values of \(\eta\). To find the optimum value of the \(\mu\) signal to noise ratio, 56 ABE of the HEC were studied in different longitudinal segment configurations.

To calculate the pile-up noise, 7 different shaping functions with peaking times from 48.75 ns to 103.75 ns were used. Results are presented only for the shaping function giving the best values (see Fig. 1). The data for the simulation of electronic noise were taken from [6]. But since these data are not expected to be the final ones, we considered two values for electronic noise: 0.33 MIP and 0.5 MIP for segments consisting of 16 cells. This is equivalent to a deposited energy (\(E_{d}\)) of 2.263 MeV and 3.394 MeV per cell. To calculate the electronic noise for \(N\) cells (\(E_{N}\)), we used the approximate formula \(E_{N}=E_{d}\cdot\sqrt{N}\).

Since it is expensive to simulate a large number of minimum bias events, we used one sample of 1000 independent events for different \(\varphi\) cells. Therefore we had effectively about 64000 pseudo events for our investigation.

The calculation procedure consisted of 3 steps. At the first step, pile-up eventswere generated for each bunch crossing. Then we summed the deposited energy in the corresponding ABE for different options of its segmentation. At the last step, the content of 40 bunch crossings preceeding the one with a \(\mu\) were summed up using weights, taken from the above mentioned shaping function, as it was done in notes [4,5]. At this step we added the electronic noise contribution, simulated using the program NORRUN with a corresponding value of \(\sigma\).

## 3 Results

First we consider the present configuration which consist of 4 segments with 8, 16, 16 and 16 ABE's. In Fig. 2 one can see the dependence of the deposited energy on the gap number in depth at different values of \(\eta\). At \(\eta\)=3.1-3.2 there is an enhancement in the region, which is in contact with the electromagnetic part of IFC. Such a big energy leakage to the HEC at \(\eta\)=3.1-3.2 is the source of additional pile-up noise.

In Fig. 3 we show distributions of the deposited energy, caused by one minimum bias interaction at \(\eta\)=3.1-3.2 for 4 segments of the present configuration. In Fig. 4 we show the same distributions but for one bunch crossing. In Figs. 5-7 one can see the distributions of the pile-up, electronic noise and \(\mu\) signal, merged with noise for 4 segments at 3 values of \(\eta\). All distributions were normalized to 1. It appeares that the form of the pile-up noise distribution is not symmetrical and has a longer tail for positive values of the deposited energy (after subtraction of a pedestal value). The maximum of the pile-up distribution has a small shift to the negative side. To get an estimate of the signal to noise ratio, we used the mean value of the \(\mu\) signal divided by the rms value of pile-up and electronic noise. Such an estimate for different segments is shown in tables 1-5. It is obvious, that the pile-up noise is larger for the first longitudinal cells of the HEC. The \(\mu\) signal is approximately proportional to the number of combined ABE's. Under these conditions it is easier to distinguish a \(\mu\) signal from pile-up noise in the last two segments. In these two segments the ratio of the \(\mu\) signal to pile-up noise is 2.4 and 3.8 at \(\eta\)=3.1-3.2, 6.9 and 16.7 at \(\eta\)=2.5-2.6 and 12.3 and 27.9 at \(\eta\)=1.8-1.9. The situation is more dramatic in the first segment with 8 channels. If we compare the ratio of the \(\mu\) signal to pile-up noise for different values of \(\eta\), we can conclude, that at \(\eta\)=3.1-3.2 it is less than one. Including the electronic noise in our analysis results in a decrease of the \(\mu\) signal to noise ratio, which is most significant for the last two segments. However, its value for the last two segments is still sufficiently good for an identification of the \(\mu\) signal.

Finally we combined the last two segments into one. In Fig. 8 we show the distributions of pile-up and electronic noise and the same distributions merged with the \(\mu\) signal for the last segment in the configuration (8+16+32) at 4 values of \(\eta\). In table 6 the \(\mu\) signal to noise ratio for the combined segment is given. For such a combined segment the values of the \(\mu\) signal to noise ratio vary from 6.7 to 3.2 at different \(\eta\). We tried to combine different numbers of last ABE, to find the best solution. In table 7 we show the \(\mu\) signal to noise ratios for some combinations. The optimal configuration is, to combine the 32 or 40 last ABE's. But in the last case the HEC would consist only of two longitudinal segments and at \(\eta\)=3.15 there would be slightly worse conditions for a \(\mu\) signal identification.

## 4 Conclusions

1. Correct calculations of pile-up and electronic noise allow to estimate the \(\mu\) signal identification capability of ATLAS HEC.

2. The influence of the electronic noise on the \(\mu\) signal is not strong in the first segments of the HEC but is dominant in the last ones.

3. The analysis of the \(\mu\) signal to noise ratio showed, that the last segments provide the best conditions for \(\mu\) identification.

4. For the \(\mu\) signal identification it is better to combine the last 32 ABE into one segment.
