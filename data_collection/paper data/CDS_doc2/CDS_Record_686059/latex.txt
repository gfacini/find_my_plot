## 1 Introduction

Capacitive readout of strip detectors require the implementation of strip biasing into the detector. For the ATLAS p\({}^{+}\)n binary detectors two different concepts have been investigated and prototyped:

1. polysilicon resistors

2. implanted resistors

While the first of these methods has been used for many years, the second method has been tried only recently.

In the following the requirements and the present state of knowledge on the properties of biassing with implanted resistors is summarized. Particular attention is paid to the influence of radiation on resistor properties (including noise). A technical comparison of the two biassing options concludes the presentation.

## 2 Requirements

The resistance value of the bias resistor is determined by the requirement that the contributed additional noise is negligible with respect to the total noise of the system. Following the TDR the detector noise (mainly dominated by the front end amplifier with connected strip capacitors) is about 1500 e-. During irradiation this number will be increased further by degrading detector and electronics properties. The bias resistor, located parallel to the amplifier input, will contribute a noise charge of

\[ENC_{R_{bias},\,thermal}({\rm electrons})=\frac{1}{q}\sqrt{\frac{4kT\tau_{f}}{R}}\]to the signal. In this simplified expression for the thermal noise \(k\) is the Boltzman constant, \(\tau_{f}\) the signal formation time (20ns), \(T\) the temperature and \(q\) the elementary charge. It is added in quadrature to the noise of all other sources \(ENC_{0}\). Figure1 visualizes this dependence of the total noise charge on the resistance value with the noise of all other sources ENC\({}_{0}\) as parameter. It demonstrates that a resistor value above hundred k\(\Omega\) already adds negligible noise when using fast ATLAS read out electronics.

## 3 Bias structure: Principle and layout

Implanted resistors are widely used in all kinds of microelectronic circuits. They are well known for their reproducibility especially in the low and medium resistance range. In contrast to polysilicon resistors, which are made of an extra polycrystalline film on top of the SiO\({}_{2}\), implanted resistors consist of a highly doped ion implanted region within the silicon itself. It can be easily included into common detector technologies by implantation of boron through the thermally grown oxide. Fig.2 shows a schematic cross section illustrating the simple resistor connection by overlapping the resistor implant with the heavily doped p\({}^{+}\) bias ring at one side and the strip implant on the other end.

An example for a layout implementation is shown in Fig. 3. In the case of serious space constraints resistor meanders can also be placed in the gaps between the strips.

## 4 Implanted resistor properties

For a desired resistance value the upper limit for the implantation dose is given by space available in the design while the lower limit should be set taking into account safety aspects. The negative boron acceptor charge will be partially compensated by the radiation induced positive oxide charge leading to an increasing bias resistance with irradiation. However, as long as the resistor channel is not pinched off completely an increasing bias resistance does not affect the detector performance. To avoid pinch off, the implanted acceptor dose has to be substantially larger than the oxide saturation charge.

Detectors with three different implantation doses were fabricated at three different locations, the MPI Semiconductor Laboratory, Eurisys Mesures and CiS Erfurt. The samples implanted with lower doses fabricated at MPI and Eurisys Mesures are already irradiated and tested while the high dose implanted CiS detectors are not yet irradiated. Table 1 summarizes the measured sheet and meander resistances.

After irradiation the resistance values are increased due to the compensation of the boron acceptor charge by positive oxide charges. Although detectors having those resistors behave very well after irradiation (see below) the implantation dose for the CiS prototype run was doubled to further reduce this effect, thereby increasing the safety margin. A simulated doping profile is shown in Fig. 4. The sheet resistance calculated from this profile is 2.9 k\(\Omega\)/sq. which is in good agreement with the values mesured on the CiS detectors.

The homogenuity of the implanted bias resistors was tested on CiS prototypes across the detector and across the batch. Very uniform properties have been found. Figure 5

shows the resistance of every second implanted meander type bias resistor of a full size wedge detector. The wafer to wafer variation was studied on 1cm\({}^{2}\) size "baby detectors" with rectangular geometry. All eleven wafers are from a single process batch. Minimal variation in the resistance values is observed (fig.6). Measurements are summarized in fig.7 showing the mean resistance values in each wafer and the standard deviations within each wafer.

## 5 Noise and signal measurements on irradiated detectors

Most ATLAS p in n detectors tested last year for the detector technology choice review were produced with implanted bias resistors. Measurements using unirradiated FELIX electronics and a \(\beta\)-source were performed before and after irradiation.

Fig. 8 show signal and noise of detector ASD4/2 (implantation conditions A) before irradiation. The FELIX electronics was operating in peak mode (75ns rise time). Signal to noise ratios of 27 and 19 were measured for 6cm and 12cm long strips, respectively.

The signal to noise of the irradiated detectors (Fig. 9) are very similar to the values obtained at irradiated n in n devices with polysilicon bias structures [2]. The homegeneous irradiation of the devices was performed with 24GeV protons with fluences of

and 3\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) cm\({}^{-2}\), respectively.

The non existing noise vs. current dependency (Figure10) proves clearly that implanted bias resistors do not cause any significant excess noise to the total detector noise.

That the signal and noise propeties are also good the at even higher irradiation dose is shown in figure 11. For completeness the results with short shaping are also shown (Fig. 12.

## 6 Technological comparison of bias resistor options

Besides the polysilicon chemical vapour deposition and etching, most polysilicon processes optimised for resistors in the required range need in addition two implantations, one for the resist once calibration itself and another high dose one to provide an ohmic contact system to the metal. To define the polysilicon pattern and the mentioned contact regions two lithographic steps are needed, while the implanted resistor option needs one implantation and at most one lithographic step 1.

Footnote 1: By an appropriate integration into the entire detector process this masking step can even be saved

The additional effort compared to the implanted resistor technology leads not only a significant price increase but introduces also additional sources of possible failures, thus requiring more elaborate acceptance tests.

Because of the large contact openings in the guard and bias regions the yield of a typical strip detector technology is not sensitive to technological contact problems like incomplete contact openings or interfacial layers. While implanted resistors do not need

any additional contacts, polysilicon resistors require either a silicon/polysilicon via contact system or a metal bridge system connecting p+ regions of the monocrystalline silicon to those of the polysilicon. Both kinds of contact devices may affect the detector yield. Spotting such technological problems requires additional test effort.

The polysilicon resistance is not only defined by the implantation dose but also by the polysilicon grain size. The exponential dependency of resistance vs. film thickness [5] results in bad reproducibility of the resistance value, in particular when comparing different production batches. In ATLAS variations to very high resistance values are especially dangerous because the voltage drop caused by high leakage currents has to be lower than the onset voltage of the punch through protection circuit connected in parallel to the bias resistors. A large voltage drop is also correlated with high electric field within the capacitor dielectric making the capacitors prone to failure in particular during irradiation.

## 7 Conclusions

Implanted resistors have been proven to provide a safe and reliable solution for biassing of ATLAS strip detectors.

Particular properties important for the operation in the harsh radiation environment are the

* Small change in resistance value due to irradiation.
* Absence of radiation induced excess noise.

Figure 12: _Signal and noise of ATLAS Prototype detector ASD4-1/7 (12 cm strip length) measured in deconvoluted mode (25ns shaping) after irradiation 3\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\)protons/cm\({}^{2}\)._

These two properties are equally well obtained with polysilicon resistors. Implanted resistors however are superior in several other respects:

* Considerably simpler technology resulting in economic gain.
* Higher reproducibiliy and uniformity of resistance values.
* The absence of small size contacts between different materials (metal-poly and metal-silicon), leading to higher yield and decreased testing efforts.

It is therefore highly desirable to use implanted resistors in the ATLAS Silicon Tracker.
