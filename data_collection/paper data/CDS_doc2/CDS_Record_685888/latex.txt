## Introduction:

Finite element analysis ( FEA ) is used to analyze deflections under gravity loading of 3 variations on a design concept for a monolithic MDT muon chamber for the ATLAS detector. A large MO chamber was chosen - this has external dimensions of 6x2.9 m and has 2 multilayers separated by a 400 mm thick spacer. Each multilayer has 4 layers of MDT type drift tubes. FEA is also used to study the deflections induced in the chamber by simple, but severe thermal gradients acting on the chamber.

Three variants on the basic design concept was studied:

**a)**: an all aluminium chamber designed so that the maximum deflection of the chamber matches the maximum sag of the anode wire.
**b)**: a similar design but with the spacer structure made from carbon/epoxy composite.
**c)**: a "stiff" chamber designed to have minimal gravitational deflection. This chamber would be constructed with a built in deflection to match the wire sag.

## All aluminium chamber matched to wire sag:

For a 6 m long drift tube, the maximum sag of the wire is about 0.6 mm. The parameters of the FE model were adjusted to yield a maximum deflection of the chamber close to this value. It is a simple matter to change these to match any reasonable wire sag. Because this turns out to require an impractically small amount of material in the spacer, the design is modified to decouple the high axial stiffness of the 2 chambers from the spacer.

The mechanical properties of the multilayer are highly orthotropic. The stiffness is very high along the direction of the tube axes and quite low across the tubes. In addition, there is a need for very accurate tube placement across the chamber ( parallel to the beam direction ) and also in the radial direction. The deflection of the chamber must, therefore, vary only along the length of the tubes to match the wire sag. Fortunately, these conditions match nicely with the properties of the chamber.

In the longitudinal direction, the high stiffness of the multilayer must be decoupled from the spacer to allow the deflection to be as much as 0.6 mm. In the transverse direction, it is not possible to decouple the multilayer from the spacer as the latter must be very stiff in this direction. Because the multilayer is not stiff in this direction, it can be strongly coupled to the spacer without inducing significant stresses in the multilayer due to pressurizing the tubes or to differential thermal expansion. The details of the design used to accomplish this are described elsewhere[1].

The FEmodel used is shown in Figure 1 and the details of the spacer structure are shown in Figure 2. The decoupling is achieved by placing a series of wide, thin beams between the spacer and the multilayers. These act to greatly reduce the shear stress transfer between the multilayer and the spacer. This allows the use of a reasonable sheet metal thickness ( 3 to 5 mm ) in the spacer structure.

All of the spacer structure is represented by 3 dimensional shell elements and the decouplers are modelled by beam elements. The multilayers are modelled by solid brick elements with propertiesadjusted to match the actual orthotropic mechanical properties of the complete multilayers. These properties were obtained from detailed FE models of sections of multilayer.

The chamber has to be supported close to its ends in order for its deflected shape to match that of the anode wires. A 3-point kinematic support is used in the model with the support points being on the spacer, not on the tubes. There are 2 supports at one end at each corner and one support at the middle of the other end. The chamber was assumed to be in the top position on the detector. The deflected shape of the chamber under gravity loading is shown in Figure 3. ( The units on all contour plots are in metres ). Note that the amount of deflection change across the chamber is less than 30 \(\mu\)m.

One side benefit of decoupling the multilayer from the spacer is that the effect of a thermal gradient through the thickness of the chamber is greatly reduced. E.g., the whole of the top multilayer was given a temperature 3 C greater than the rest of the chamber. This is a very severe example. The deflection resulting from this is shown in Figure 4. ( Note that in all plots of thermal deflection, the gravitational deflection is turned off ). The deflections are small (+80 to -125 \(\mu\)m ) and have a simple shape amenable to monitoring. With a somewhat more complex thermal input (one half of the multilayer at +1.5 C and the other half at -1.5 C differential ) the deflections become much smaller ( +27 to -63 \(\mu\)m ) as seen in Figure 5.

### Chamber with carbon/epoxy spacer:

The above FE model was modified to use a carbon/epoxy composite material for all of the spacer structure. The thickness of the various members was modified to get a chamber deflection of about 600 \(\mu\)m. The deflected shape under gravity loading is shown in Figure 6. The only significant difference is that the change in deflection across the chamber is now quite negligible. However the mass of the chamber is reduced from 732 kg. to 345 kg. The thermal deflections for the same conditions used above are considerably reduced as seen in Figures 7 and 8. In Figure 7, note that the total range of the deflections is -5 to +52 \(\mu\)m and in Figure 8 the range is -8 to +6 \(\mu\)m The carbon/epoxy spacer would also be much less affected by a thermal gradient through the spacer itself.

A further benefit of the composite material is that it has a much higher degree of internal damping than aluminium. If vibration becomes a problem, this may well be a crucial advantage. This is currently being investigated using modal analysis.

### Stiff chamber design:

Another design concept is to build and support the chamber so that its gravitational deflection is small enough to be ignored. The chamber can be constructed with a built in deflection to match the gravitational wire sag. This type of structure is much stiffer than those considered above and will thus have higher frequency vibration modes and be less susceptible to vibrations. It is, however, more sensitive to thermal gradients.

The FE model used above is modified to remove the decoupling beams and all of the spacer members now run the full 400 mm between the multilayers and are tightly connected to the latter. In addition, the 3 point support is placed so as to minimize the deflection of the chamber. The deflected shape is shown in Figure 9. The support locations are obvious on this figure. The maximum deflection of 112 \(\upmu\)m is somewhat misleading as about 50% of this is due to very localized indentations at the support points. This would be eliminated by appropriate reinforcement of the multilayer and by locating the spacer webs at the support points. The mass of this chamber is 504 kg.

The thermal deflections under the same conditions as used above are shown in Figures 10 and 11. The deflection ranges for the 2 cases are -498 to +323 \(\upmu\)m and -186 to +71 \(\upmu\)m. These are quite large but the deflected shapes are still simple and easy to monitor. Also, the applied temperature loads are very extreme and probably not representative of actual conditions. It should be emphasized that the actual nature of the thermal environment in the functioning detector needs to be better understood if accurate estimates of chamber thermal deflections are to be made.

### Vibration analysis:

FEA also allows one to calculate the frequencies and shapes for any number of vibration modes of complex structures. Preliminary modal analysis of the first of the above design concepts is shown for the first 2 modes in Figures 12 and 13. The first mode is a torsional mode with a resonance at 7.4 Hz. The shape of this mode is determined by the 3 point support with one end of the chamber basically rotating about the single support at one end. The second mode is the expected simple vertical oscillation and has a frequency of 22.8 Hz. The fundamental resonance of the anode wire is about 24 Hz. Higher order modes of the chamber have frequencies greater than 50 Hz and involve vibrations of the individual lengths of the spacer webs. The carbon/epoxy spacer design has a higher frequency first mode but the second mode is only slightly higher. The vibration modes of the "stiff chamber are at much higher frequencies ( Figures 14-17 ). The results of the modal analysis are given below.

### RPC chambers:

The FEA models incorporated the ability to add layers of RPC chambers directly onto the outside of the chambers. They were modelled as a layer with a uniform mass distribution and essentially no mechanical stiffness. In the wire sag matching variants, while it was found to be possible to come up with a spacer design which met the 600 \(\upmu\)m deflection criterion ( Figure 18 ), the weight penalty was not acceptable. For the all aluminium design, the mass of the spacer increased from 442 to 1154 kg. For the carbon/epoxy design, the spacer mass increased from 56 to 120 kg. For the stiff chamber concept, it was not found possible to support the RPC's on the chamber while keeping the deflection below, say, 50 \(\upmu\)m. The FEA solution did not converge, i.e. as structure was added to stiffen the chamber, the extra weight resulted in more deflection, not less. This is because one is adding structure close to the neutral axis where it makes only a small contribution to the moment of inertia of the cross-section but a large contribution to the weight.

It is not reasonable or necessary to control the deflection of the RPC layers to the same degree as is needed for the drift tubes so these results are not too surprising. The RPC's need to be supported by a separate, light-weight and relatively flexible frame which is then mounted to the chambers at the points at which the chambers themselves are mounted to the toroid structure.

### Tube pressurization:

The effect of the 5 bar absolute operating pressure in the drift tubes was described in detail in a previous note[2]. That note was based on the 3 bar value in use at the time. As the 5 bar pressure has the effect of doubling the tube gauge pressure, the dimensional changes seen in a free standing 6x2.9 m multilayer would be:

\[\mbox{in width }-\ 0.818\ \mbox{mm}\hskip 56.905512pt\mbox{in length }-\ 0.342\ \mbox{mm}\]

While these values would be modified by attaching the multilayer to the spacer, the stresses induced by these constraints would be small. However, as some dimensional changes would be seen, it is recommended that the tubes be pressurized at assembly time until all the epoxy adhesive has set. This will ensure that all tubes will be at their desired positions under operating conditions. The effects of removing the pressure after assembly is complete and all epoxy is cured was studied using a FE model of a 1 m long section of chamber ( Figure 19 ). Symmetry allowed the use of just one half of the chamber. The deflections of the tubes are shown overall in Figure 19 and in detail at the ends and middle of the model in Figures 20 and 21 respectively. It is interesting to note that because the lateral size change noted above is constrained by the cross web, the vertical dimension change of the 4 layers of tubes is about twice that obtained from the diametral change in a single, free tube. The end effects become negligible at about 6 to 8 tubes in from the end.

The stresses in the cross web at the points of contact with the tubes are very small ( < 1.4 kPa ) as shown in Figure 22. This suggests that stresses in the adhesive will also be very small. Experience of detailed analysis and experiments on the SDC tubes confirms this. A more detailed 3-d FEA model with elements representing the epoxy is being developed.

## Summary of results:

In the following table all deflections are given in \(\upmu\)m and show the total range of deflection from maximum to minimum.

## Discussion:

FEA of three slightly different designs for a monolithic MDT chamber shows that all of the concepts are mechanically practical. The stiff chamber design is the simplest and cheapest to build - the only complication is that the deflected shape must be built in using shims under the chamber during its assembly. The major drawback of this design is that it is more affected by thermal gradients than the other concepts. Its higher stiffness may be of benefit if vibration is a problem. It is also necessary to build in different amounts of deflection for chambers used in different parts of the detector.

Allowing the chamber sag to match the wire sag allows all chambers of the same size to be interchangeable - at least at assembly time. It also greatly reduces the sensitivity to thermal gradients. The chambers are somewhat more complex and thus more costly. The all aluminium variant is also somewhat heavier than the stiff chamber. Vibration mode frequencies were found to be surprisingly high for such a large structure. The question of the significance of these modes will depend on the power spectrum of vibration sources such as cryogenic flow, air flow etc.

Using a carbon/epoxy composite spacer reduces the thermal sensitivity still further and greatly reduces the mass of the chamber ( 345 to 732 kg ). Because it is designed to give the same gravitational sag as the all aluminium design, its fundamental vertical resonance mode is about the same ( Figure 15 ). The first ( torsional ) mode is at a higher freqency ( Figure 14 ) as are all higher order modes because of the greater transverse stiffness of this design. In addition, the high internal damping of the composite is precisely what is needed to control any vibration problem. Cost will generally be greater for the composite material.

The current RPC chambers are too heavy to be mounted directly to the surface of the chambers, especially if a'stiff' design is used. While it can be done if a carbon/epoxy spacer is used, the cost penalty would be significant. It is much more cost effective to mount the RPC's on a separate frame attached at the chamber mounting points.

Because the 5 bar operating pressure in the tubes produces significant tube detections, it is recommended that the tubes be pressurized at assembly time. While it is possible to predict these deflections using FEA, the accuracy of this would be affected by the difficulty in modelling the exact geometry of the adhesive bonds.
