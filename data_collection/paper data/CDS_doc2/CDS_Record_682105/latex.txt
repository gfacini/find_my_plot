###### Abstract

The determination of the electronic calibration parameters for the ATLAS Forward Calorimeter 199 5 prototype is discussed. Signal linearity of the pre-amplifier and shaper units is found to be well within the design goal of \(\pm 1\%\), after corrections for sizeable clock feedthrough in the calibration pulser system, of about 3.6% (45%) of the whole dynamic range on average, in the low (high) gain stage. Residual channel-to-channel fluctuations in the reconstructed charge after electronic calibration are then only about 0.5% _rms_.

## 1 Introduction

The electromagnetic and hadronic forward calorimeters in ATLAS have a novel tube/rod readout geometry meeting the required physics performance in the extremely high radiation LHC environment. They are located in the endcap cryostat at \(3.2<|\eta|<4.9\). The first short prototype of the electromagnetic forward calorimeter (FCAL) confirmed overall performance expectations during the Brookhaven (1993) and CERN (1993) testbeams [1]. The second full depth prototype tested in 1995 at CERN showed excellent performance, including very good linearity (within 1%) and resolution (constant term about 3%) for the electron signal [2, 3, 4].

The determination of some of the basic performance parameters of this calorimeter like \(e/mip\), requires an absolute charge calibration of the digitized signal. This is also true for the determination of a _universal_ electron calibration constant for the ATLAS FCALs from testbeam data, which should be independent of the electronics actually used. In this note we describe the methods we used to determine parameters of such calibration functions which are expected to be linear to first order over the whole dynamic range (up to 200 GeV per channel in this testbeam). The study was done on electronic calibration data collected in summer 1996 in a laboratory setup including the same electronics and readout used in the actual testbeam experiment.

The electronic readout chain of the FCAL prototype setup and the calibration system are described in the first part of this note. Calibration pulser normalization and other source correction procedures are discussed in section 3, while the choice of calibration models and the related parameter error estimation are presented in section 4. The final results on all quantities relevant to the electronics calibration, including gain variations and gain ratios, are summarized in section 5, followed by a brief conclusion and outlook.

## 2 Test Setup

A test stand specifically for electronics has been set up in the laboratory at the University of Arizona, after moving the whole experiment back from the testbeam area in 1995. Thissetup includes all relevant original elements used in the testbeam itself, like the prototype and its cryostat, all cold and warm signal cables, the feedthrough, the electronics including the pre-amplifiers and shapers, the track & hold units and the FERA ADCs. In the following we describe some of the key elements of this chain important for electronics calibration.

### Analog electronics

The readout electronics of the 1995 FCAL prototype is organized on 6 motherboards (MB), with the first five MB's holding 15 pre-amplifier/shaper (PA/S) on single channel daughterboards. The sixth MB has 16 PS's, yielding a total channel count of 91. The \(\emptyset\)T pre-amplifiers are standard ATLAS design, as described in [5]. The bipolar shaper characteristics follow the suggestions given in [6]. The MB's sit in a closed crate (Faraday cage) on top of the feedthrough (see also fig.1).

Each pre-amplifier is connected to a group of 4 tube electrodes via a cold \(20\Omega\) signal cable, matching its input impedance. The shaper output is transmitted to track & hold units, located about 7.5 m away, using a differential line driver/receiver and \(100\Omega\) twisted pair cables. A simplified model of one electronic channel is shown in fig.2.

The track & hold units are organized by groups of 15 or 16 on a motherboard, matching the pre-amplifier/shaper organization at the cryostat. The track & hold output (basically a DC voltage when gated) is split into a high and low gain by corresponding amplification/attenuation of the hold signal. The higher (lower) gain accommodates about 20(200) GeV per channel before causing an overflow condition in the ADCs.

Figure 2: _Electric model of the FCAL prototype readout. Each group of four tubes with energy is a current source generating \(I_{\mathrm{gap}}\), with a detector capacitance of \(C_{\mathrm{det}}\approx 1.5\) nF. A calibration pulser is connected to the input of the pre-amplifier, delivering a calibration current \(I_{\mathrm{cal}}\)._

### Calibration system

The calibration system for the 1995 testbeam electronics consists of one current source located on the calibration controller board, and repeaters of this source on each MB and each PA /S. The source is controlled by an 8 bit digital-to-analog converter1 (DAC) adjusting the pulse height. The pulse itself is triggered externally by the data acquisition program or a clock. Addressing of individual motherboards and pre-amplifier units with any possible pattern is also provided. The calibration current and addresses are distributed on a backplane.

Footnote 1: National Semiconductors DAC08

Each addressed MB receives the current step pulse and distributes it to the addressed PA /S. The repeater on the PA /S basically transforms the incoming edge of a given current drop into a pulse shaped very similar to those arriving from the tube electrodes at the PA input, see fig.3. The peak amplitude of this pulse is directly proportional to the size of the current step, as set by the DAC.

### Digital readout and triggering

The gated track & hold output is read by 11 bit LeCroy FERAs, with 16 channels per module. These ADCs are integrating the input current (up to 250 mV on 50 \(\Omega\)) for a given gate width (here 100 ns), with a granularity of about 0.25 pC per count. The FERAs and other ADCs, scalers and registers are read by a PC via CAMAC.

The whole timing sequence of event triggering and readout in the laboratory is steered by the data acquisition (DAQ) program itself. For a calibration run this sequence is structured into logical blocks following the beam spill structure:

1. a pulse height and pattern is sent to the calibration system controller via serial bus (RS232). For the data analyzed in this study, all 91 channels are fired simultaneously.
2. a pulse is generated by the DAQ program and sent to the calibration system. This pulse is shaped and distributed to the MB's and the finally to each addressed PA /S.
3. the same trigger pulse is used to gate the T&Hs and the FERAs. Appropriate delays are adjusted to make sure that the T &H gate arrives at the peaking time of the shaped

Figure 3: _Pulse shapes at the electrode (**A**), at the input of the pre-amplifier (**B**), and at the output of the shaper (**C**), taken from simulations._output signal. The FERA starts digitization very shortly (\(50-100\) ns) after T&H gating, to avoid signal losses due to the droop2 of the T&H output. Footnote 2: at a rate of \(2.5-5\) mV/\(\mu\)s
4. the FERAs initiate the event readout after digitization is complete. Event data is stored in the PC memory, and the next event is triggered, as described in item (2) and following.

Usually 600 events are triggered for a given pulse height. As every pulsed event is followed by an "empty" pedestal event (gating FERAs without pulsing the calibration system), a maximum of 1200 events are stored in the PC memory at a time. Before changing to the next DAC level, these events are written to disk. In one calibration run the pulse height is ramped through 20 DAC levels between 0 and 255, meaning about 24000 events per run, taken at a typical rate of 1500 Hz. The event size for the FCal 1995 prototype test was 272 16 bit words in total.

## 3 Calibration of the Pulser System

The calibration pulse height is set by the DAQ program using the 8 bit DAC described in section 2.2. With this system it is possible to establish the calibration of the digitized response to charges injected at the input of the pre-amplifier. For physics calibration purposes it is of course more interesting to calibrate this response to charges introduced in the liquid argon (LAr) gap at the electrode, which then can be calibrated to energy. This introduces two additional steps, the first being a correction for signal losses and shape modifications at the connection of the electrodes (\(Z\approx 5\ \Omega\)) to the transmission line (\(Z=20\ \Omega\)) and along the transmission line itself. In addition we observed a certain feedthrough of the trigger (clock) signal to the input of the pre-amplifier, leading to a non-zero response even for DAC level 0. This has to be taken into account in the determination of the final calibration functions and parameters as well. Both corrections are discussed in this section.

### Calibration Source Normalization

The calibration system used in the 1995 testbeam does not allow injection of charge pulses directly at the electrode (cold calibration). It is possible, however, to normalize the digital input signal to the DAC of the warm calibration system described above to charges in the LAr gap, by comparing shaper _output_ signal amplitudes simulated in SPICE for a triangular current pulse in the LAr gap with the ones measured for certain DAC levels in a dedicated laboratory experiment.

Detailed simulations are needed to calculate the signal losses and shape modifications in the whole transmission line up to the pre-amplifier. The simulation setup therefore includes not only one group of four tube electrodes and the pre-amplifier and shaper, but also a realistic model of the cold 20 \(\Omega\) transmission line, the warm cable and the transformers3. Current pulses can be calculated at various locations of the simulated chain, of course (see fig.3, for example).

In a small laboratory experiment we then determined the relation between a given input DAC level \({\cal P}_{\it{dac}}\) and the current amplitude at the output of the shaper by directly measuring the calibration current \(I_{\it{cal}}\) corresponding to a chosen \({\cal P}_{\it{dac}}\) at the input of a PA/S.

Combining the simulated and experimental data we can establish the relationship between the \({\cal P}_{\it{dac}}\) and the corresponding charge in the gap. In the picture of current pulses, this can be done using the ratios of the source current amplitudes \(I_{\it{gap}}\) and \(I_{\it{cal}}\) to the corresponding shaper output amplitudes \(I_{\it{SHout}}\) for these two setups. For linear electronics these ratios are independent of the actual \(I_{\it{gap}}\) or \(I_{\it{cal}}\) and can be written as:

\[\frac{I_{\it{SHout}}}{I_{\it{gap}}} = \frac{I_{\it{SHout}}^{\,\,sim}}{I_{\it{gap}}^{\,\,sim}}\quad\mbox { for the simulations, and} \tag{1}\] \[\frac{I_{\it{SHout}}}{I_{\it{cal}}} = \frac{I_{\it{SHout}}^{\,\,exp}}{I_{\it{cal}}^{\,\,exp}}\quad\mbox { for the experiment.} \tag{2}\]

By combining the two equations we can relate \(I_{\it{cal}}\) to the corresponding \(I_{\it{gap}}\) for identical output signals \(I_{\it{SHout}}\). Naturally the simulation needs to describe the real electronics sufficiently well. This has been verified to about 1% for the active elements in the chain4.

Footnote 4: a direct test of the (cold) transmission line and its connection to the electrode was not possible.

The excellent linearity of the pulser system allows us to relate \(I_{\it{cal}}\) to the input \({\cal P}_{\it{dac}}\) to better than 0.5% in a straightforward way:

\[I_{\it{cal}}=\lambda\cdot{\cal P}_{\it{dac}}\quad\mbox{ with }\quad\lambda=\frac{2.14\,\mbox{mA}}{255}=0.0084\,\mbox{mA}\,. \tag{3}\]

The charge in the gap \(Q_{\it{gap}}\) can be calculated from \(I_{\it{gap}}\) by:

\[Q_{\it{gap}}=\int_{0}^{t_{d}}I_{\it{gap}}(t)\,dt=\frac{1}{2}\cdot I_{\it{gap} }\cdot t_{d}\quad\left(I_{\it{gap}}=I_{\it{gap}}(t=0)\right)\,, \tag{4}\]

Figure 4: _Distribution of the clock feedthrough charges Q\({}_{\it{cl}}\) for all working electronic channels of the FCAL prototype._

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]

From the fitted \(a\) and \(b\) we can then determine the clock feedthrough charge in each channel as \(Q_{\mathit{cf}}=b/a\cdot\kappa\). The \(Q_{\mathit{cf}}\) for all channels are basically Gaussian distributed, with an average of about 0.4 pC and a standard deviation of 0.1 pC (see fig.4). This can be compared to the whole dynamic range of the readout, which is about 11 (0.9) pC, meaning 3.6% (45%) occupancy by \(Q_{\mathit{cf}}\) in the low (high) gain stage.

## 4 Absolute Charge Calibration Functions

As discussed earlier, the digitized signal \(\mathcal{R}_{\mathit{adc}}\) should be calibrated to the absolute charge collected in the gap, as this is directly proportional to the energy of electrons or photons entering the calorimeter, via a _universal_ electron calibration constant. Having calibrated the input DAC levels from the pulser to the charge in the gap \(Q_{\mathit{gap}}\) (see the previous section), we can now directly investigate the relationship between \(Q_{\mathit{gap}}\) and \(\mathcal{R}_{\mathit{adc}}\) for the low and high gain amplification stages in the readout. These relationships are expected to be very close to linear. This behaviour is reflected in the choice of models we studied, mainly lower order polynomials. (See the following section 4.1.)

The determination of the errors of the model parameters must take into account possible correlations. We use Monte Carlo techniques to get correct estimates for these errors, as

Figure 5: _Low gain calibration for one electronic channel for the FCal prototype. The plots show the experimental data points (\(Q_{\mathit{gap}}\),\(\mathcal{R}_{\mathit{adc}}\)) together with the results of fits of eq.(10) (**A**), eq.(11) (**B**) and eq.(14) (**C**). The residual deviations from each model \(\Delta Q/Q_{\mathit{gap}}\) are shown in addition._

described in the last paragraph of this section.

### Charge Calibration Parameter Determination

The charge calibration functions for the FCAL prototype should relate the measured digitized response \({\cal R}_{\it adc}\) to the charge in the gap \({\it Q}_{\it gap}\), which, in the case of the calibration events discussed in this note, is given by eq.(8). Since this function is expected to be basically linear, we consider the following two models for the "true" charge calibration function: a first degree polynomial

\[{\cal Q}({\cal R}_{\it adc})=p_{0}+p_{1}\cdot{\cal R}_{\it adc} \tag{10}\]

and a linear function with a quadratic correction

\[{\cal Q}({\cal R}_{\it adc})=p_{0}\,+p_{1}\cdot{\cal R}_{\it adc}+p_{2}\cdot{ \cal R}_{\it adc}^{2}\,. \tag{11}\]

To determine the unknown parameters \(p_{j}\) in eqs.(10) and (11), we fit data points5\(({\cal R}_{\it adc,j},Q_{\it gap,j})\) obtained from the electronic calibration runs to these two models. All fits are performed using a least square method, i.e. minimizing a merit function defined as:

Footnote 5: note that this is actually an inverted fit, as the \({\cal R}_{\it adc,j}\) are the measured quantities!

\[\chi^{2}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\frac{(Q_{\it gap,j}-{\it Q}({\cal R}_{\it adc,j};p_{0},\ldots,p_{m}))^{2}}{\sigma_{j}^{2}}\,, \tag{12}\]

where each charge value \(Q_{\it gap,j}\) (see eq.(8)) has an experimental error given by \(\sigma_{j}\), in the order of 0.5%. Since the models under consideration (eqs.(10),(11)) are linear in the parameters \(p_{j}\), we can directly solve the linear system of equations emerging as a minimization condition of eq.(12):

\[\frac{\partial\chi^{2}}{\partial p_{j}}=0\hskip 56.905512ptj=1\ldots m \tag{13}\]

for the unknown parameters \(p_{j}\).

The first order polynomial of eq.(10) gives unsatisfactory results for the low gain signals. The residual deviations from linearity can easily be in excess of 1%, with fitted \(\chi^{2}\)'s indicating relatively low confidence levels for this model. (See fig.5A, for example.)

Figure 6: _High gain calibration using the pure linear model in eq.(10) with \(p_{0}=0\). Note the suppressed scales on the abscissa and ordinate. The residual deviations from linearity \(\Delta\,Q/Q_{\it gap}\) are well within 1%._

A better description of the experimental data is possible using the second fitting model eq.(11), as can be seen in fig.5B. This model, however, introduces a charge offset \(p_{0}\) for \({\cal R}_{\it adc}=0\). This unphysical feature is eliminated by forcing the model function in eq.(11) to go through the origin, fixing \(p_{0}=0\) and leaving only two fit parameters \(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\):

\[{\cal Q}({\cal R}_{\it adc})=p_{1}\cdot{\cal R}_{\it adc}+p_{2}\cdot{\cal R}_{ \it adc}^{2}\,. \tag{14}\]

This modification then gives about the same confidence level in the fits as the original model eq.(11), with residual deviations well within 1 %, see fig.5C. The quadratic correction in eq.(14) becomes comparable in magnitude with the linear term only for high signals \({\cal R}_{\it adc}\). The typically four orders of magnitude difference between the fitted \(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\) indicates a signal non-linearity in the readout chain, emerging only for those large signals.

The dynamic range of the high gain stage is limited to the small input signal region. Therefore, and from the qualitative behaviour of the calibration functions for the low gain stage, we do not expect any significant correction to a pure linear relation between \(Q_{\it gap}\) and the response in this case. Correspondingly, fitting eq.(10) with \(p_{0}=0\) already gives a very good description of the data, resulting in typical deviations from linearity below 1% and high confidence levels for the fits, see fig.6.

### Correlated Parameter Error Estimation

Correlations between the fitted parameters \(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\) for the low gain calibration model eq.(14) can reach 75 %. This must be taken into account in the error estimation for \(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\). In a dedicated Monte Carlo experiment we verified that these parameters are normally distributed. For this, low gain data points \(({\cal R}_{\it adc},Q_{\it gap})\) for a given channel have been independently fluctuated about 1000 times within their experimental errors \(\Delta{\cal R}_{\it adc}\) and \(\Delta Q_{\it gap}\) following a Gaussian distribution. The parameters \(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\) are then re-fitted at each of these iterations, and found to be normally distributed with \(\sigma_{p_{1}}\) and \(\sigma_{p_{2}}\). The resulting joint distribution is

Figure 7: _Joint distribution of \(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\) obtained from the Monte Carlo studies for one electronic channel. The region inside the ellipse contains very close to \(68.3\%\) of all simulated data points, corresponding to a \(1\sigma\) confidence level._

shown in fig.7. The errors are finally given by: [7]

\[\Delta p_{j}=\sqrt{\Delta\chi^{2}}\cdot\sigma_{p_{j}}\,,\ \ \ \ \ j=1,2 \tag{15}\]

with \(\Delta\chi^{2}=2.3\) for two degrees of freedom and the usual \(1\sigma\) confidence level. \(\Delta p_{\,1}/p_{1}\) is around \(0.4\%\) on average while the average \(\Delta p_{\,2}/p_{2}\) is about \(6\%\).

## 5 Results

The results of this electronic calibration studies for the FCal prototype are summarized in this section.

One complete motherboard and a few individual channels were found to have dead calibration pulsers, in addition to some problematic channels with unusually high \(\chi^{2}\) for the final fitted models, see fig.8. Those have been inspected and it was found that they all have problems in the pulse repeater on the pre-amplifier/shaper daughterboards. For the summary of the results shown in this section we therefore consider only channels with \(\chi^{2}\leq 4\), leaving \(62\) good channels.

The most important parameters in our models for electronic calibration are the gains \(p_{\,1}\) for the low and high gain amplification stages. The average \(p_{1}\) for all good channels is \(6.0\) fC/cts, with channel-to-channel fluctuations of about \(5\%\)\(rms\) for the low gain stage. The corresponding gain for the high gain stage is \(0.49\) fC/cts on average with about the same relative channel-to-channel fluctuations, see fig.9. Correlations between the high and low gain \(p_{\,1}\) can be seen in fig.10.

Figure 8: \(\chi^{2}\) _per degree of freedom for channels on the first five motherboards (left). The sixth motherboard (channel numbers \(76\) through \(91\)) has a broken calibration system and is therefore excluded. The \(\chi^{2}\) distribution of the remaining \(62\) good channels is shown on the right._

Figure 9: _The electronic gain parameters \(p_{1}\) for high (open circles) and low (full circles) gain amplification stages, as function of the electronic channel number (good channels only, left figure). The corresponding distributions are shown in the two figures on the right._

The quadratic correction parameter \(p_{2}\) introduced in the calibration function for the low gain amplification stage is shown in fig.11. This parameter is only weakly correlated with the electronic gain parameter and shows much larger channel-to-channel fluctuations of about 28% \(rms\).

The quality of the calibration models can be measured by the relative difference between the reconstructed \(\mathcal{Q}(\mathcal{R}_{\mathit{adc}})\) and pulsed charges \(Q_{\mathit{gap}}\):

\[\frac{\Delta Q}{Q_{\mathit{gap}}}=\frac{\mathcal{Q}(\mathcal{R}_{\mathit{ adc}})-Q_{\mathit{gap}}}{Q_{\mathit{gap}}}\,, \tag{16}\]

where \(\mathcal{Q}(\mathcal{R}_{\mathit{adc}})\) is calculated according to eq.(14), with \(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\) as fitted for the low gain, and the fitted \(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\) = 0 for the high gain stage. Fig.12 shows the distributions of \(\Delta Q/Q_{\mathit{gap}}\) for the two gain stages, indicating a very good charge reconstruction for all calibration pulse heights in all good channels, with small residual channel-to-channel fluctuations of less than 0.5% \(rms\).

The gain ratio between the two amplification stages can be measured by the ratio of the high and low gain responses for a given electronic channel at a given calibration pulse height. This ratio does not depend on a certain electronic calibration model and is expected to be independent of the input signal, as can be seen in fig.13. The average gain ratio is 12.71, which is very close to the theoretical expectation of 12.75. The observed channel-to-channel fluctuation in this ratio is quite large, about 2.7% \(rms\). This is beyond expectations from the tolerances in the electronic components used in the two gain stages6. (See section 2.1.)

Figure 11: _Correction parameter \(p_{2}\) for the low gain calibration model for good electronic channels (left). The picture on the right shows that \(p_{2}\) is not really correlated with the electronic gain itself._

Therefore it seems that the major contribution to this fluctuation comes from the difference in the calibration of the internal charge digitization in the two FERAs used to read out the signals from low and high gain.

At the level of the reconstructed charge the differences in the internal calibration of the FERAs and other (smaller) channel-to-channel variations in the final stage amplifiers are unfolded. The distribution of the ratio of the charges reconstructed from the high and low gain stage for the same input signal is therefore expected to show significantly less fluctuations, see fig.14. On the other hand this ratio does not allow to measure the gain ratio directly as the reconstructed charges should be identical. Deviations of this variable from unity can be understood from the residual deviations between the fitted calibration models and the corresponding data points.

## 6 Conclusions

In this note we describe the determination of the electronic calibration model and its parameters for the bi-gain readout of the 1 995 prototype of the ATLAS Forward Calorimeter (FCal). The most important feature of this model is that it allows reconstruction of the charge collected in the liquid argon gap, which is the most interesting physics quantity for absolute calibration of the FCal. This requires re-normalization of the signal pulse height as given by the calibration system, to take into account transmission line losses, signal shape modifications and clock feedthrough. The corresponding corrections are necessary because the calibration pulse is injected directly at the input of the pre-amplifier. They have been determined using detailed simulations and dedicated laboratory experiments.

The best model to describe the calibration data is given by a linear ansatz for the relation between the digital response and the input charge signal. A small quadratic correction term is required for the low gain stage response, taking into account a measured nonlinearity in the pre-amplifier/shaper units for high signals, observable in this gain only. This model allows

calibration of both gain stages within \(\pm 1\%\), with residual channel-to-channel fluctuations of less than 0.5% \(rms\) for the whole dynamic range.

The design expectation for the ratio of high and low gain amplification can also be confirmed to about 0.3% on average from the ratio of measured responses in the two gains stages. This result is obtained even without applying the electronic calibration functions discussed above. Using these functions, however, significantly reduces the channel-to-channel fluctuations of this ratio from about 2.7% to 1% \(rms\).

The methods developed in the course of this study, especially the correction for clock feedthrough, will most likely be used for electronic calibration of the next FCal testbeam data in 1998. In addition, improvements are foreseen in the calibration system itself, to significantly reduce the presently observed clock feedthrough of about 3.6% of the dynamic range in the low gain and about 45% of the dynamic range in the high gain stage.
