###### Abstract

In this note the measurements and quality control checks on the steel absorbers for the Hadronic Tile Calorimeter of the ATLAS detector are reviewed. In total 41658 sheets of 4.05 mm thickness and 40800 sheets of 5.00 mm thickness were produced and accepted.

Introduction

The steel for the absorbers of the hadronic tile calorimeter of the ATLAS detector is produced in the following steps.

Hot rolled coils are used as the incoming material. The thickness is about 5.5 mm, the weight of the coil is 2\(-\)2.5 tons. One melt is 120\(-\)220 tons. The Czech standard for the steel is CSN 11375.28 (equivalent to EN 10025).

In the Cold Rolling Mill the first step is acid pickling in 17% HCl at 60\({}^{\circ}\) C. Then follows neutralization, washing (2 sections) and drying by hot air. The next step is rolling: for type A (5 mm) annealing and smoothing-rolling; for type B (4.05 mm) rolling with the reduction each pass of 20%, annealing and smoothing-rolling. The recrystallization annealing is performed in the continuous annealing furnace in 6 sections at a temperature of 650\(-\)800\({}^{\circ}\) C in an atmosphere 96% N, 1.5\(-\)3% H. Two coils pass through the furnace together with a speed of 5.1 m/hour. The whole cycle takes approximately 14 hours (heating, annealing at the given temperature, cooling).

The cold rolling process runs in Kraluv Dvur (Czech Republic), where also the type B sheets are cut. The B type sheets are shipped to Dubnica nad Vahom (Slovakia) and Minsk (Belarus). The type A material is sent to Vitkovice (Czech Republic) as coils, where it is cut into sheets. These are then transported to Koprivnice (Czech Republic) for further processing (punching).

## 2 The order

After the successful tender sent out by CERN, the order for the supply of laminated steel sheets as absorbers for the ATLAS hadronic tile calorimeter [1] was placed in the Cold Rolling Mill in Kraluv Dvur near Prague. The same company produced the steel absorbers for Module 0 of the tile calorimeter [2].

In accordance with the contract, the following quantities of absorbers were ordered:

* 40800 sheets of dimensions 1620 x 400 x 5.00 mm\({}^{3}\), with the thickness tolerance \(\pm\) 0.05 mm
* 41600 sheets of dimensions 1620 x 400 x 4.05 mm\({}^{3}\), with the thickness tolerance \(\pm\) 0.04 mm

The required average sheet thickness tolerance is \(\pm\) 0.025 mm over the whole production and the tolerances in length and width are (+30 -0) mm and (+1.5 -0) mm respectively.

The order for the type B sheets was slightly changed: 29600 sheets of dimensions 1620 x 400 x 4.05 mm\({}^{3}\) and 12000 sheets of dimensions 1620 x 410 x 4.05 mm\({}^{3}\). The reason for this change was the possibility of a better arrangement for the punching of the spacer plates.

Further details and Quality Control Plan are given in the CERN document CERN-IT-2490/PPE/ATL [3].

## 3 Chemical analysis, identification of each melt

Chemical analysis from the pans (hot rolled coils) was measured in the hot rolling mill, one measurement per melt. The maximum content according to the specification is given in Table 1. Example of the measured values for melt no. 30731 are in Fig. 1.

The steel is killed steel, where the nitrogen content is less then 0.01% (Fig. 2). The content of carbon was measured by two methods. Contents of carbon and sulphur was determined using infra-red absorption, from one gramme of steel filings in a LECO 125 analyser (Fig. 3). Contents of all elements was determined by glow-discharge spectroscopy using LECO GDS spectrometer (Fig. 4a).

The melt number identifies each melt. All the produced sheets came from 18 melts.

## 4 Complete chemical analysis

The complete chemical analyses were performed in the laboratories of the cold rolling mill. The maximum content from the order is given in Table 1, the results of the measurements for one coil are given in Fig. 4a. The measured values, corresponding average values and RMS are shown in Table 4 for 4.05 mm steel and in Table 5 for 5.00 mm steel. Distribution of Carbon and Manganese content is given in Fig. 4b. In the figure one can see that the average content of Carbon is 0.08% with the precision of 15% (see also Table 4 and Table 5) in agreement with the specification.

## 5 Surface-state inspection

Surface-state inspection is made visually during the rolling and cutting. Sheets with noticeable defects are excluded, their number is less than 0.4%. The producer, on the basis of surface state, also rejects the first and last turns of each coil.

thickness values for the remeasured pallets are not shown in these figures. However, for the type A (5 mm) about 0.5% of pallets and for type B (4.05 mm) less then 2% of pallets respectively were not accepted since the mean thickness was in most cases too low.

Furthermore of type A 191 sheets were excluded because of scratches and "double layer" and 32 were not accepted because of damage during the transport from Vitkovice to Koprivnice.

The wedge shape, which is rather important for the master plates was also measured and the mean value for the 5 mm sheets is 0.020 mm with RMS of 0.015 mm. The measured values of dimensions are displayed in Fig. 12. The values lie in the limits given in the order. The overall measured thickness for 4.05 mm sheets is (4.041\(\pm\)0.014) mm and for 5.00 mm sheets is (4.993\(\pm\)0.017) mm in agreement with the specification.

## 9 Planarity

Measuring the longitudinal and border sagitta checked the planarity. The maximum acceptable values are 2 mm and 4 mm respectively. The measured values are in the acceptance limits. The results of measurements for the 5 mm steel are given in Fig. 13. For the 4.05 mm steel the values are similar, but the measurements were not recorded, because for the small spacers, the values are not as critical.

## 10 Internal stress

The test sheets were carefully cut and the sides put one to the other (see CERN method [3]). No measurable space between the cut sides has been observed.

## 11 Conclusions

The quality of the accepted sheets of the steel produced by the Cold Rolling Mill in Kraluv Dvur corresponds to the quality requirements given in the CERN order. The results of quality control and corresponding measurements are given in Table 4 and 5.
