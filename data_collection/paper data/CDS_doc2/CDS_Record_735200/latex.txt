In summer 2003, a Monitored Drift Tube chamber of type BIL has been exposed to a 100 GeV muon beam in the X5 area at CERN. The chamber was installed on a rotating support in the Gamma Irradiation Facility GIF, where a \({}^{137}\)Cs radioactive source irradiates the detectors with an intense photon flux. A system of lead filters that can be moved in front of the source allows the users to tune the intensity of the flux.

Detailed studies on the determination of the TDC spectrum parameters were performed, also as a function of the background conditions. The rotating support allowed to change the angle of the chamber with respect to the beam. The set of data taken at different orientation was used to perform a preliminary analysis of the conventional autocalibration procedure in absence of background.

Introduction

During two weeks in July 2003, an Atlas MDT chamber of type BIL has been installed in the Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF) area at Cern. The chamber was exposed to the 100 GeV muon beam delivered by the X5 beam line, and to the photon radiation produced by a 680 GBq \({}^{137}\)Cs source. Two small chambers with four layers of six tubes each, commonly referred to as "bundles", were installed on the same support. This beam test was made with the following motivations:

* Study in detail the effect of the serial gas system distribution for a MDT chamber, with particular emphasis on understanding the behaviour under irradiation. This study had been already planned for the 2002 BIS-bundle test in X5/GIF [1], but problems with the gas-tightness of the bundle chamber seriously compromised the analysis.
* Evaluate the performance of the conventional autocalibration method [2], both with a clean muon beam and in the presence of photon background.
* Evaluate the performance of different tracking algorithms at high rate.

The understanding of the data taken with the source switched off is crucial for performing any subsequent high rate analysis. This note presents the outcome of several studies on the determination of the TDC spectrum parameters that are meant to establish a clear procedure for extracting \(t_{0}\) and \(t_{max}\) from any data set. Autocalibration studies were also performed, with the aim of understanding the dependence from the angular spread of the muon tracks.

## 2 Experimental set-up

The BIL chamber is composed of 2 multilayers, each made by 4 layers of 36 MDTs. The chamber was mounted with the tubes in vertical direction on a rotating support, and it was positioned inside GIF at a distance of \(\approx 1.5\) m from the \(\gamma\) source and centred on the beam line. The two bundles were built specifically for the 2003 test, to be used for the analysis of the serial gas system distribution effect and also to serve as external trackers for the BIL in order to perform autocalibration and tracking studies at high rate. They were installed on the same rotating support, forming a rigid system with the BIL. One bundle was positioned in front of the BIL chamber, rotated by +45\({}^{\circ}\) with respect to the vertical axis; the other one was positioned behind the chamber, rotated by -45\({}^{\circ}\). The bundles were positioned in such a way that they crossed on the beam spot.

### Gas System

Both multilayers of the BIL chamber were equipped with a serial gas distribution system (brass tubelet version), with 3 tubes in each series. The chamber had been certified in Rome 3 as leaking less than \(10^{-6}\) bar litre/s. For what concerns the bundle, the 6 tubes in each layer were connected in series. The gas bars were manufactured in Rome 3 for the bundle installed upstream of the BIL chamber and in Rome 1 for the one downstream; the two gas bars were of different design, and both were built in order to overcome the gas-tightness problems experienced in 2002. Both bundles were certified as leaking within Atlas specifications.

The main gas mixing rack was assembled outside GIF; it included mixing of Ar and CO\({}_{2}\) at the nominal Atlas percentages of 93% and 7% respectively, pressure regulation at 3 bar absolute pressure, and a hygrometer to measure the water content at the exhaust. Two lines from the mixing rack were bringing the gas mixture inside GIF: one line was used to supply gas to both multilayers of the BIL connected in parallel; the other was feeding gas to the Rome 3 bundle and, in series, to the Rome 1 bundle.

Both the BIL and the bundles were operated in flushing mode, and both gas flows were set to one volume exchange per day. The water content dropped from 100 ppm to about 50 ppm in the first three days of running, from July 5th to 8th, and remained stable afterwards.

### Temperature read-out

In total, 6 temperature sensors were placed at different locations on the BIL. The sensors were connected to an Atlas Muon ELMB, that was interfaced via CANbus to a PC running Windows XP via a KVASER card. The temperature were read out by a PVSS application, that recorded on disk the sensors measurements every minute. An example of the day/night temperature variation is shown in Figure 1.

The dependence of the maximum drift time from the temperature has been taken into account applying the correction determined in [5]. All the values of \(t_{max}\) have been evaluated at the reference temperature of 25\({}^{\circ}\). The reference temperature was chosen as the rough average of the day-night variation over the two weeks of data taking.

Figure 1: Temperature variation recorded by the 6 sensors.

### Front end electronics and DAQ

Given the fact that the spot size of the X5 muon beam is only 10 to 15 cm in the horizontal direction, only the 12 central tubes of each BIL layer were read out. In total, the chamber was equipped with 4 mezzanine-lite cards. Two additional mezzanines were used to read out the bundles, and one more to record the timing of the trigger signal.

A CSM adapter next to the chambers was powering the front-end boards and distributing the JTAG signals. The rest of the read out electronics, namely the CSM0 module, had to be placed outside GIF due to the radiation level in the area. In this situation, the length of cables connecting the CSM adapter to the CSM0 amounted to \(\sim 25\) m, and a LVDS retransmitter had to be used to ensure proper communication between CSM0 and mezzanine boards.

The VME crate housing the CSM0 was interfaced to a PC running Windows via National Instruments' VXI-MXI2 bus. The data acquisition software was a modified version of the "MiniDAQ" program developed at the University of Michigan [4]. The X5 MiniDAQ version features an online event display and an extended logging of JTAG and other relevant settings. An instantaneous data transfer via TCP/IP to a second PC running Linux was also implemented, in order to allow a quasi-online analysis. Data files were automatically copied from the Linux PC to the CERN tape storage system CASTOR via Central Data Recording (CDR) services.

### Trigger

The beam trigger signal for 2003 running was formed by the coincidence of upstream and downstream scintillators. The upstream counters consisted of two \(10\times 10\) cm\({}^{2}\) plastic scintillator slabs (identified as T1 and T2) superimposed along the beam direction. They were placed before the \({}^{137}\)Cs source, shielded from radioactivity by a concrete wall. Immediately downstream of the BIL-bundles set-up, two more scintillators T3 and T4 were installed adjacent to one another to cover the beam spot: the dimensions of T3 (T4) were 9 cm (7 cm) vertically and 20 cm horizontally. The delayed coincidence between T1 and T2 was put in coincidence with the OR of T3 and T4, forming a trigger signal of width 100 ns.

## 3 GIF environment

Muons from the X5 beam had an energy of \(\sim 100\) GeV. The beam had a horizontal width of about 10-15 cm, corresponding to three tubes being fully illuminated on the BIL when the chamber was orthogonal to the beam. A rate of 1-1.2 k particles per SPS spill during source off runs was observed; the much lower rate with respect to the 2002 data taking was mainly due to the different settings of the X5 beam line, and only partly to the more selective trigger logic adopted.

The 680 GBq \({}^{137}Cs\) source at GIF emits photons of 660 keV energy. The intensity of the photon flux can be adjusted by moving a set of lead filters positioned between the source and the detector. The different settings of the filters are usually expressed by "absorption factors": an absorption factor of 1 means that the source is completely unshielded, while an absorption factor of 2, 5 etc. means that the source intensity is reduced by a corresponding factor.

Besides allowing the tuning of the background rate over several orders of magnitude, the filters also ensure that the photon flux is constant over a plane in a fixed distance fromthe source rather than on the surface of a sphere (\(1/r^{2}\) attenuation law). When the BIL and bundles were installed, particular care was taken to remove all small set-ups that are normally present in GIF for parasitic ageing, since they may unevenly shield the \(\gamma\) flux on the BIL (as was the case in 2002).

Photon count rates on the BIL corresponding to the different absorption factors are shown in Table 1. These rates where measured using a random trigger uncorrelated with the beam.

## 4 Data taking and analysis framework

During the period from July 5th to July 15th, data were taken changing at different background intensities and varying the rotation of the chambers around the vertical axis. For each configuration of source absorption factor (including the source switched off) and tracks' angle, about 500 k events were acquired. The set-up was rotated from -15\({}^{\circ}\) to +15\({}^{\circ}\) in steps of 2.5\({}^{\circ}\). Negative angles are completely equivalent to the positive ones for what concerns the autocalibration procedure, but they correspond to different illuminated zones of the BIL and bundles. Having more than three tubes with a high statistics in terms of muon tracks is crucial to study the effect of the serial gas system distribution. In addition, runs at -20\({}^{\circ}\) and +20\({}^{\circ}\) were taken for tracking studies.

Data without photon background are used as reference and to find a space-time relation to be used as a starting point for high rate analysis.

Overall, more than 45 million events were collected. All runs were transferred to the Rome 1 farm and analysed using the software package _Calib_[3], _v4_r4_. In the following, all tubes, layers and multilayers will be numbered according to the 5-digits _Calib_ scheme: the first digit identifies the chambers in the set-up (1 for the Rome 3 bundle, 2 for the BIL and 3 for the Rome 1 bundle), the second digit identifies the multilayer (multilayer 1 being the one closer to the source), the third digit is the layer inside each multilayer (where layer 1

## 5 Drift time spectra

A typical TDC spectrum of the BIL chamber in the absence of photon background is shown in Figure 2, along with the fit performed using the "standard" 6-parameters empirical function

\[N(t)=p_{1}+\frac{p_{2}+p_{3}\cdot e^{-\frac{t-p_{5}}{p_{4}}}}{(1+e^{\frac{p_{5}- t}{\tau_{s}}})\cdot(1+e^{\frac{t-p_{6}}{\tau_{d}}})}, \tag{1}\]

where \(\tau_{s}\) and \(\tau_{d}\) are the slopes of the Fermi-Dirac functions used to fit leading and trailing edge of the TDC spectrum. From this global fit, the rising edge \(t_{0}\) and the falling edge \(t_{f}\) (corresponding, respectively, to the \(p_{5}\) and \(p_{6}\) parameters in 1)are extracted. The maximum drift time \(t_{max}\) of the BIL chamber is around 680 ns.

Studies performed on the 2002 BIS data [1] demonstrated that, even if the Fermi-Dirac slopes are left as free in the fit, \(t_{0}\) and \(t_{f}\) values obtained from the global fit are slightly biased with respect to the results from the separate fit of rising and falling edges. While this small bias is of no consequence for studies performed in a clean environment, it might

change with the amount of photon background and thus could pose a problem for a high rate analysis. In addition, a global fit becomes increasingly difficult when the TDC spectrum is overwhelmed by the photon background. For these reasons, all the following analysis was carried on using the method of performing separate fits for the rising and falling edges. Examples of those fits are shown in Figure 3.

### Precise determination of \(\mathbf{t_{0}}\) and \(\mathbf{t_{f}}\): how many events are needed?

When taking data with MDT chambers, the maximum drift time must be continuously monitored in order to spot any variation in the operating conditions of the gas mixture (composition, applied high voltage). In addition, the \(t_{0}\) values for individual tubes are used as input to determine the muon drift time from the raw TDC time, and must be known with sufficient accuracy.

It is therefore important to establish the minimum number of muon tracks crossing a given tube that must be collected in order to have a meaningful determination of \(t_{0}\) and \(t_{f}\) (and thus \(t_{max}\)).

This study was performed using a single run taken without photon background and containing a total of 400 k events. No temperature correction has been applied, since no significant variation occured over the two hours of data taking. In these conditions, the two tubes (namely 7 and 8, connected to the same mezzanine in each of the two multi-layer) on each layer that are fully illuminated by the beam are crossed by about 120 k muon tracks. Only these tubes have been used for the analysis.

The runs has been subdivided in order to get increasingly less statistics on the drift time spectrum, namely 60 k, 30 k, 15 k and 10 k entries respectively. For each subset, the separate fits of the rising and falling edges of the TDC spectra have been performed. The average \(t_{0}\) values for the tubes on the two multilayers are shown in Table 2, while the \(t_{f}\) values are shown separately in Table 5.1 for tubes 7 and 8 (due to the serial gas system effect). The comparisons between the \(t_{0}\) values obtained from the full sample of tracks

may change at any switching off/on of the electronics. Since \(t_{0}\) values are used in the determination of the muon drift time, it is important to establish their interval of validity. Figure 8 shows the distribution of \(t_{0}\) values along the data taking period for the 4 BIL mezzanines. Mezzanines 1 and 2 (belonging to the first multilayer) show two distinct distributions corresponding to the runs taken before and the black-out of July 11th.

### Change in the maximum drift time with the background rate

Due to the fact that only the first observed hit is recorded in each event, the drift time spectrum in the presence of photon background is not a simple superposition of the photon and muon contributions. The shape of the muon spectrum gets distorted at high background rates, as shown in [1], where a method to unfold the \(\mu\) contribution was developed.

Photon count rates at absorption factors 1 and 2 are almost prohibitive for the BIL chamber: it is evident from Figure 9 that a fit of the falling edge cannot be performed, while the \(t_{0}\) could still be evaluated. The data taken in these conditions must be carefully studied, possibly cleaning the spectra with the aid of the bundles to reconstruct the muon tracks.

Starting from absorption 5, that corresponds to 180-220 kHz/tube depending on the multilayer, the muon TDC spectrum (see Figure 10) is clearly distinguishable from the uncorrelated photon background, and a fit of both the rising and falling edges is possible.

In order to accumulate more statistics, the spectra of all the tubes illuminated by the beam and placed in the same position in the gas distribution series have been added together. The maximum drift time decreases linearly with the amount of background, as shown in Figure 11. The behaviour observed is in qualitative agreement with the measurements performed on the BIS chamber in 2002. The difference in absolute value of \(t_{max}\) between BIS and BIL is due to the different gas systems (premixed bottle in 2002 and mixing rack in 2003) and to the fact that the reference temperature was set to different values.

## 6 Autocalibration studies

Determining the space-time relation in the absence of photon background constitutes the first step for subsequent high rate analysis. In addition, the runs collected during the 2003

beam test provided a nice set of data to perform systematic studies on the autocalibration procedure itself. The analysis presented in the following has been done on the BIL data.

### Dependence from the track angular spread

It is well known that the fit residuals for a single track impact angle do not provide sufficient information to uniquely infer the impact radii from the measured drift times. This is normally overcome by using a set of tracks taken at different angles with respect to the wires. the study presented in the following aimed at determining what is the impact of the angular spread of tracks available on the accuracy of the r-t relation.

#### 6.1.1 Autocalibration on individual multilayers

Figure 12 shows the space-time relation obtained starting from the integral of the TDC spectrum and using the full angular spread available, _i.e._\(\pm 20^{\circ}\). The autocalibration

Figure 14: Differences between the r-t relation obtained using the full angular spread and using only tracks within \(\pm 10^{\circ}\), \(\pm 7.5^{\circ}\) and \(\pm 5^{\circ}\). In all cases, the initial space-time relation has been determined from the integral of the TDC spectrum. The deviation is within \(\pm 15\mu\)m using tracks below 10\({}^{\circ}\), it becomes \(\pm 60\mu\)m for tracks below 7.5\({}^{\circ}\) and gets as high as \(\pm 200\mu\)m for the smallest angular spread. The figure on the bottom right shows all three results on the same scale.

procedure has been applied to a single multilayer, namely multilayer 1, requesting the presence of a single track, a minimum of 3 hits for each reconstructed track and at most 1 missing hit. On the single multilayer, about 15 iterations are needed to converge, with residual averages below 1 \(\mu\)m (as illustrated in Figure 13).

With the same procedure, the r-t relation has been calculated for narrower angular spreads, namely \(\pm 10^{\circ}\), \(\pm 7.5^{\circ}\) and \(\pm 5^{\circ}\). In all three cases, a good convergence is reached in about 20 iterations, with residual averages below 1 \(\mu\)m.

The difference \(\Delta r\) in radius as a function of the drift time with respect to the result with the full set of track angles are shown in Figure 14. The deviation is already significant (up to \(\pm 60\mu\)m) when using only tracks up to \(7.5^{\circ}\), and becomes unacceptable for track angles below \(5^{\circ}\): in this case the radius difference varies up to \(\pm 200\mu\)m. The results are comparable for both multilayers.

In order to investigate to what extent the autocalibration procedure is sensitive to the initial r-t relation, the same study has been repeated starting from the space-time relation obtained from the data of the 2002 beam test in H8.

When using the full angular scan, the autocalibration process starting from th H8 2002 relation converges to residual averages below 1 \(\mu\)m in \(\sim 12\) iterations, while 15 iterations are needed when only tracks within \(\pm 10^{\circ}\) are used. The r-t relation is in both cases compatible with the one obtained for the same angular spread from the drift time spectrum: the differences in radius are below \(\pm 4\mu\)m (see Figure 15).

The comparison between the full angular scan and each partial scan, when using the H8 2002 r-t relation as a starting point, is shown in Figure 16. The variation \(\Delta r\) is limited to \(\pm 10\mu\)m and \(\pm 20\mu\)m, for tracks within \(\pm 10^{\circ}\) and \(\pm 7.5^{\circ}\) respectively. A discrepancy of \(\pm 60\mu\)m is observed for an angular spread of \(\pm 5^{\circ}\).

A linear space-time relation was also tested as a starting point; in this case, the convergence is much slower (40 iterations are needed using the full angular spread), and already with tracks within \(\pm 20^{\circ}\) there is a \(\pm 20\mu\)m difference with respect to the result from the TDC spectrum, as shown in Figure 17.

Figure 15: Comparison between the space-time relations obtained starting from the integral of the TDC spectrum and from H8 2002 results, using the full angular spread. The differences in radius are within 4 \(\mu\)m.

#### 6.1.2 Autocalibration on both multilayers

The analysis presented above has been repeated using the pattern recognition on both multilayers; a minimum of 7 hit belonging to the track has been requested. The drift time spectrum has been used to derive an initial space-time relation. The autocalibration procedure was applied allowing for separate r-t relations on the two multilayers. The first observation is that the convergence is much faster when using both multilayers (see Table 4). The comparisons between the space-time relation obtained from the full angular scans and from partial scans is shown in Figure 18. It is evident that the deviations are within an acceptable range even when using only an opening angle of \(\pm 5^{\circ}\).

Figure 16: Differences between the r-t relation obtained using the full angular spread and using only tracks within \(\pm 10^{\circ}\), \(\pm 7.5^{\circ}\) and \(\pm 5^{\circ}\). In all cases, the space-time relation obtained from H8 2002 data has been used as a starting point. The deviation is within within acceptable limits using tracks below 10\({}^{\circ}\)and 7.5\({}^{\circ}\) (where \(\Delta r\) is within \(\pm 10\mu\)m and \(\pm 20\mu\)m respectively). The radius difference is comprised within \(\pm 60\mu\)m for track angles below 5\({}^{\circ}\).

Figure 18: Comparison between the r-t relation obtained using the full angular spread and using only tracks within \(\pm 10^{\circ}\), \(\pm 7.5^{\circ}\) and \(\pm 5^{\circ}\). The integral of the TDC spectrum has been taken as a starting point, and the autocalibration procedure has been carried on using both multilayers.

### Convergence of the algorithm

The autocalibration analysis presented above has been performed using the full statistics available, _i.e._ between 400k and 500k events for each position of the chamber. In order to optimize the performance of the algorithm, the convergence of the procedure has been tested using the full angular spread of \(\pm 20^{\circ}\) and comparing the r-t relation obtained after 10 iterations using the full sample or using only 50k events from each of the 15 runs. Two different approaches for the smallest sample have been attempted:

* Perform all 10 iterations always on the same 50k events portion of each run. The space-time relation obtained is compatible with the one from the full data set, as shown in Figure 19.
* Perform the first iteration on the first 50k events of each run, the second one on the second portion (using the r-t relation from the previous step as input), and so on. Also in this case, Figure 19 shows that there is full agreement with the result from the complete sample.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c} \hline \hline
**angle** & **1** **multilayer** & **2** **multilayers** \\ \hline
**20** & 15 & 8 \\
**10** & 20 & 8 \\
**7.5** & 25 & 10 \\
**5** & 25 & 10 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The left plot refers to the result obtained iterating 10 times on the same subsample of each run. The right plot refers to the result obtained by performing each iteration on a different subsample of each run. Both cases are compatible with the space-time relation in Figure 12 within a few \(\mu\)m.

Both methods also give compatible corrections at each iterations; a comparison for the first, fifth and tenth iteration is shown in Figure 20.

## 7 Conclusions

The determination of the TDC spectrum parameters have been studied in detail, with the aim of defining a clear procedure for evaluating \(t_{0}\) and \(t_{f}\). It is evident from the analysis presented that about 30 k tracks crossing a single tube are needed in order to obtain a reliable estimate of the \(t_{0}\) value. Concerning the \(t_{f}\) evaluation, the number of tracks needed is of the order of 60 k.s

The analysis illustrated in Section 6.1 prove that the traditional autocalibration method exhibits an important dependence from the angular spread of incident tracks. In particular, the r-t relation is quite far from the true one if muon tracks are all hitting the chamber at an angle smaller than \(5^{\circ}\), even starting from an already good space-time relation. The angular dependence is greatly reduced when performing pattern recognition on both multilayers for the autocalibration procedure. This last result is relevant for the analysis of the data from the 2003 beam test in H8, where the maximum angular spread of muons hitting the chambers was indeed \(5^{\circ}\).

The results presented are of course dependent from the number of positions of the chamber within a given angular spread; for the study presented here, the angle of the chamber with respect to the beam was varied in steps of \(2.5^{\circ}\) from \(0^{\circ}\) to \(15^{\circ}\), and an additional position at \(20^{\circ}\) was also introduced. It would be important to perform the same analysis varying the track incident angle with a finer granularity; this measurement will be possible during the H8 beam test in 2004, when a BIL chamber will be installed on the same rotating

support and will take data throughout the summer.

The autocalibration studies have been performed using the conventional method. The same data set have been recently analysed with a new autocalibration technique [6], that has a much weaker dependence from the angular spread of the muon tracks.

As far as autocalibration is concerned, this note only shows results obtained in the absence of photon background. Understanding the data quality in a clean environment is a necessary step before performing high rate studies. The analysis of the data taken at different source absorption factors is under way, and will be presented in forthcoming notes.
