ABSTRACT

We have simulated the expected performance of the ATLAS Barrel EM calorimeter in a realistic environment. We have included the best estimates for the material of the tracker, the coil, cryostats, the space for electronics and the calorimeter support structure in the simulations. Liquid argon was used as the active medium. We have studied the effective performance expected from the present design: solid angle coverage by the calorimeter, photon and electron energy and position resolution as a function of pseudorapidity (\(\eta\)) and energy, as well as the ability to suppress background from \(\pi^{0}\)'s to isolated \(\gamma\)'s. The results show that due to the combination of the material in the Inner Detector and the large amount of the material in front of the EM calorimeter added by the superconducting coil the calorimeter performance is well below the LOI specifications of \(\Delta E/E\approx 10\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 1\%\). This deterioration covers a large fraction of the solid angle in spite of various corrections. We expect this to have a non-negligible effect on the ATLAS physics performance.

Introduction

According to the ATLAS LOI [1] specification, to achieve the physics goals at the LHC, good EM calorimetry for identification and measurement of photons and electrons in the energy range from 7-10 GeV up to few TeV, is one of the design criteria for the calorimetry system. The performance goal is to achieve energy resolution of \(\Delta E/E\approx 10\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 1\%\) and the preshower detector is expected to give the factor 3 for multiphoton rejection. To maximize the physics reach a large acceptance in \(\eta\) coverage is also considered as important.

The liquid ionization EM calorimeter[2] chosen for the ATLAS experiment is based on a novel electrode design of the accordion type. This concept was invented and developed at CERN by the RD3 collaboration[3]. The recent results of this collaboration have shown that with liquid argon (LAr) as the active medium an energy resolution was obtained less than \(10\%/\sqrt{E}\) with a constant term smaller than \(0.4\%\)[3]. With liquid krypton (LKr) an energy resolution of \(6.7\%/\sqrt{E}\) was obtained by the former GEM collaboration at BNL [4]. Besides the required energy resolution there are many other advantages offered by this technology, e.g., it enables the achievement of a hermetic design with high granularity, good uniformity, fast response, precise timing[5], very good position and angular measurements of the electromagnetic showers while maintaining the high radiation resistance. Unique to this design of the EM calorimeter is the possibility to integrate the \(\pi^{0}\) identifier into the first longitudinal section.

In order to study the performance of the the EM barrel calorimeter in the ATLAS detector, we have carried out a full GEANT simulation with the accordion structure and liquid argon as the active medium for the option with an integrated preshower detector and partially also for the option with the dedicated cold preshower detector. In both cases the intrinsic energy resolution of calorimeters (with no passive material in front) was better than \(9\%/\sqrt{E}\). This simulation includes the material in the Inner Detector(ID) as defined in the Cosener's House design. The materials and dimensions of the cryostat, coil, the space for electronics, the calorimeter support structures and the calorimeter itself were used as defined by [6]. The effects of the magnetic field are also included. We have studied the energy resolution and position resolution versus energy and \(\eta\) for both \(\gamma\)'s and electrons as well as the effect of the dead material on the ability of the integrated preshower detector to distinguish \(\gamma\)'s from \(\pi^{0}\)'s. The vertex position was not smeared in z-coordinate, nor was the impact point moved across the calorimeter cell in \(\phi\). The latter is known to result in the modulation in the mean energy response of the calorimeter, which if not fully deconvoluted may worsen the energy resolutions presented later by a few tenths of a percent. More details about this simulation can be found in [7].

## 2 Geometry and Material

Fig. 1a shows the number of radiation lengths(X\({}_{0}\)) as used in this simulation for the ID vs. \(\eta\). Near \(\eta=1.4\) with \(\approx 0.6\) X\({}_{0}\), a significant number of conversions will occur for both photons and electrons.

Fig. 1b shows the total number of X\({}_{0}\) of the ID plus the cryostat walls, the Figure 1: The amount of material (in X\({}_{0}\)): a) in the Inner Detector; b) in front of the active part of calorimeter; black dots show the amount of material as assumed in LOI.

coil and the structure in front of the active part of the EM barrel vs. \(\eta\). In the LOI it was assumed that this amount of material will vary from 1 X\({}_{0}\) at \(\eta\)=0 to 2.5 X\({}_{0}\) at \(\eta\)=1.4. Note that especially at large \(\eta\) the amount of dead material is substantial in the present geometry. In an attempt to compensate for the energy loss in that material, the "massless" gap approach is implemented, that is, the lead absorber in part of the first longitudinal section of the calorimeter is replaced by G10. The optimal radial depth of the massless gap was found to be 3.9 cm at \(\eta\)=0. However, with \(>3\) X\({}_{0}\) of the material in front of the calorimeter for \(\eta>0.9\), this approach does not fully recover the energy resolution which is degraded at larger \(\eta\).

Fig. 2a shows the total number of X\({}_{0}\) in the active part of the EM accordion calorimeter vs. \(\eta\) for various thicknesses of lead absorber plates: 1.6, 1.4, 1.2, and 1.0 mm. Note the steep falloff of active calorimeter beyond \(\eta\approx 1.4\). This means that the barrel resolution will degrade beyond this point due to back leakage. A lead thickness of 1.6 mm is the design of the absorber up to \(\eta\)=0.8, then, to improve the energy resolution, the lead thickness is changed to 1.2 mm and the remaining absorber thickness is filled with G10. A depth of less than 25 X\({}_{0}\) results for \(\eta\)\(\geq\)1.35. The back leakage may then start to further detoriate the energy resolution beyond this \(\eta\). Fig. 2b shows the number of X\({}_{0}\) in the active accordion for the simulated configuration. Fig. 2c(2d) shows the total number of X\({}_{0}\) (absorption lengths - \(\lambda\)) out to the the outer cryostat wall vs. \(\eta\). There is a peak in the distribution of material at \(\eta\approx 1.2\) which corresponds to 45 X\({}_{0}\) or \(\approx 3.6\)\(\lambda\) even if 1.2 mm lead absorber is used at \(\eta>0.8\).

The EM energy measurement is supposed to be done by the endcap for \(\eta>1.4\). But at the beginning of this region the particle has to traverse a large amount of the material to cross the barrel cryostat walls, the coil, the cables and the services in between cryostats before reaching the front wall of the endcap cryostat. Since the amount of dead material will be too large (\(\geq 5X_{0}\) up to \(\eta\sim 1.7\)) it is not expected to get any useful measurement on the isolated photons or electrons in this region. The endcap resolution will improve once the particles are free from the barrel interference which occurs at about \(\eta\) of 1.8.

Conclusions:

* The amount of the material in front of the active part of the EM calorimeter is 1.75-2 times larger than was assumed in the LOI.
* Just from the geometry the dead region between barrel and endcap is at least 0.4 in \(\eta\)(between \(\eta\)=1.4 and 1.8). It will be larger if the requirement of full shower containment and the isolation cone are added. The LOI is not quantitative in this point but require that this crack must be kept small. To evaluate ATLAS physics performance quite smaller crack was considered. For the process H\({}^{0}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\), based on the study[8], a crack of 0.2 unit in \(\eta\) was used. For process H\({}^{0}\to 4\ell\)'s fiducial cuts were estimated to retain 90% of events, but already with a loss of 0.4 this would retain approximately only 50%=(2.1/2/5)\({}^{4}\).
* The large number of \(\lambda\)'s at \(\eta>0.9\) may have a non-negligible effect on Figure 2: The amount of the material: a) in the active calorimeter for Pb thickness of 1.6, 1.4, 1.2, and 1.0 mm; b) for Pb thickness as used in this simulation; c) out to the outer cryostat wall(in X\({}_{0}\)); d) out to the outer cryostat wall(in absorption lengths).

## 3 Photons

We first simulate the response of photons in the calorimeter. Table 1 gives the RMS and \(\sigma/\sqrt{E}\) for photons with 40 GeV E\({}_{T}\) vs. \(\eta\). In all that follows, the value of (RMS or \(\sigma\))/E is multiplied by \(\sqrt{E}\) assuming that the entire contribution to the resolution is just the sampling term. At this energy range, this is a good approximation and allows some comparison to be made of the numbers for various energies and angles. The value of \(\sigma\) is obtained by fitting the energy distribution in the region of the peak.

Figs. 3a,b show the "measured" energy distributions at \(\eta=1.1\) and 1.3 for E\({}_{T}\) = 40 GeV. After corrections, which are described later, the energy distributions are narrower and the low energy tails are reduced (figs. 3c,d,e,f), but they do not vanish even for the cluster size \(7\times 7\) towers (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.17\times 0.17\)). The energy resolution is also not improved significantly with larger cluster size.

Fig. 4 shows separately the energy distribution for photons unconverted in ID and for those, which converted (E\({}_{T}\) = 40 GeV, \(\eta\) = 1.1). The "measured" distribution for unconverted photons (Fig. 4a) illustrates a broadening of the peak (the intrinsic resolution is better than 9%/\(\sqrt{E}\)) due to the passive material in the cryostat walls and coil. The "measured" distribution for converted photons (Fig. 4b) shows that the low side of the peak and the further broadening is due to the combination of the early conversion in the ID and a larger probability of showering in the passive material thereafter. This causes a higher mean energy loss in the passive material and subsequently less energy with significant fluctuations to reach the active part of the calorimeter. Figs. 5a,b show the relative energy loss and its fluctuations at \(\eta\) = 1.1. As can be expected the effect is larger at lower energies and larger \(\eta\) (figs. 5c,d). This of course adds to other contributions to the energy distribution.

One can try different algorithms to narrow the energy distribution. For example, a variable weight can be given to the energy in the first longitudinal section of the calorimeter. Figs. 4c,d show that there is a correlation in the total energy with that in the first section. Figs. 4e,f uses that correlation and displays the energy distributions after the correction. The width is narrowed significantly for the unconverted photons, but only slightly for the converted photons and the tail to the low side remains. Note also the difference in the mean value of the peak position. Because of that, to obtain the corrected energy distributions shown in Figs. 3e,f, different sampling ratios have to be used for samples of unconverted and converted photons. For instance, for 66 GeV photons at \(\eta\) = 1.1 and cluster size of 5x5 towers, an inverse sampling ratio of 5.255 is used for unconverted while 5.397 is used for converted photons.

If one could determine the energy of the charged particles in the tracker due to the conversion of the photon, this may lead to another type of correction. However, Fig. 6 shows that this is unlikely to improve the energy resolution. Fig. 6a shows the number of all charged tracks from converted photons which would leave the ID. Although it peaks at 2, there are many other values. Fig. 6b also shows the number of charged tracks but for those events when the Figure 3: a) and b) “Measured” energy distribution for all photons; c), d), e), f) Corrected energy distribution for all photons (see text to find about the procedure used), assuming that the converted photons can be identified.

energy of the charged particles leaving the ID exceeds 10% of the energy of the photon. Fig. 6c shows the total energy carried out from the ID by charged particles. Finally, Fig. 6d shows that there is no correlation between the energy in the calorimeter and that in the charged particles.

The photon shower position resolution is also affected by the large amount of the material in front of the coil (mainly in the bending plane). Fig. 7 shows the position resolution for photons with \(\mathrm{E}_{T}=40\) GeV at \(\eta=1.1\) and \(\eta=1.3\) both for the case when the photons convert in the tracker and when they do not. The position resolution is \(\approx 6\mathrm{mm}/\sqrt{E}\) when the photons do not convert, but grows to \(\approx 5\mathrm{cm}/\sqrt{E}\) when the photons convert.

Conclusions:

* The energy resolution, even for \(\gamma\)'s which do not convert in Inner Detector, does not comply with the LOI requirement.
* The converted \(\gamma\)'s, if not eliminated, will further deteriorate the energy resolution. The result for all photons is an energy resolution of not better than \(\sim 13\%/\sqrt{E}\) at \(\eta\)=1.1 and \(\sim 18\%/\sqrt{E}\) at \(\eta\)=1.3 after corrections.
* The information from the ID also does not help (unless one considers rejection of the converted \(\gamma\)'s which would be a large loss at high \(\eta\)) since the total energy carried out from the ID by the charged particles varies from 0 to the full energy of the \(\gamma\) and is poorly correlated with the energy measured in the calorimeter.
* Moreover, the shower position measurement in the bending plane is detoriated by an order of magnitude (RMS of \(5\mathrm{cm}/\sqrt{E}\)) for converted \(\gamma\)'s at \(\eta\)\(\geq\)1.1.
* For the Cosener's version of the ID \(\sim\)32% of \(\gamma\)'s will convert at \(\eta\)=1.1 and \(\sim\)37% at \(\eta\)=1.3 in the ID.

## 4 \(\pi^{0}\) Rejection

The dead material also affects the ability of the calorimeter to reject \(\pi^{0}\)'s with high efficiency for photons. The mechanism is that once the photon converts, the magnetic field disperses any charged tracks in \(\phi\). There is then a larger chance for some significant energy to be deposited at some distance from the main shower position and so give the same sort of pattern that a multiphoton would give. The devices that measure in this direction are particularly vulnerable. The \(\eta\) strips[9] proposed by GEM are much less sensitive to this effect, but still an excessive amount of dead material causes trouble.

The response of \(\eta\) and UV strips[10] to typical unconverted photons is shown in Fig. 8a. Fig. 8b shows this response for photons which converted in the ID. Note that while response of \(\eta\) strips is still compatible with that of single photon, UV strips detect structures similar to those shown in Fig. 8c, which correspond to \(\pi^{0}\)'s with one of their photons converted in the ID. Table 2 and Table 3 give the rejection factors for \(\eta\) strips and UV strips. The rejection Figure 7: Shower position resolution in bending plane a) and c) for unconverted photons; b) and d) for photons which converted in ID.

Figure 8: Response in the strips (\(\eta=1.1,\) E = 66 GeV) a) for a typical unconverted photon; b) for some single photons which convert in the ID at the stated radius; c) for sample \(\pi^{0}\)’s with one of its photons converted in the ID.

factor for \(\eta\) strips degrades with increasing \(\eta\) and increasing energy. There is some improvement if the acceptance for \(\gamma\)'s is reduced from 90% to 80%. The UV strips also have degraded performance due to converted photons. Once a certain amount of dead material is present (particularly beyond \(\eta\approx 1\)), even lowering the \(\gamma\) acceptance(not an attractive proposition) does not allow the recovery of the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection until the level where converted \(\gamma\)'s are eliminated is reached. Without significant \(\gamma\) conversions the performance of the UV-strips would be generally better than the performance of the \(\eta\)-strips.

An attempt to distinguish between single isolated \(\gamma\)'s converted in front of the coil and \(\pi^{0}\)'s based on the preshower information only was unsuccessful.

As can be seen from Fig. 9, also combined information from the ID and EM calorimeter is not promising. Here, the E(ID)/E(cal) distribution is plotted, assuming an ideal ID measurement of the momentum of all charged particles (E(ID)) associated with the converted \(\gamma\), for both single \(\gamma\)'s and \(\gamma\)'s from \(\pi^{0}\) decays. Indeed, if one assumed, based on Figs. 9a,b, that the acceptance of the single \(\gamma\)'s can be significantly improved by labeling as "single" \(\gamma\) the EM showers which have E(ID)/E(cal) ratio within the peak on Fig. 9a, then Fig. 9c shows that most of the single \(\gamma\)'s which contribute to the peak convert at the outer part of the ID. Hence, the accuracy of the momentum measurement on charged tracks would be limited, causing the peak of the distribution to be smeared.

Conclusions:

* Even with the relatively narrow \(\eta\)-strips (width of \(\Delta\eta\)=0.002 or \(\sim 3\)mm at \(\eta\)=0 which would result in 92160 preshower channels in the barrel) the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection is below the value needed for \(\eta>1\) for 90% \(\gamma\) acceptance. Again the reason is an excess of material in front of the preshower.
* they will detect similar structures for the converted \(\gamma\)'s as for \(\pi^{0}\)'s. It seems that there may not be a way to distinguish between the single isolated \(\gamma\)'s converted in front of the coil and the \(\gamma\)'s from \(\pi^{0}\) decays.

## 5 Electrons

Electrons behave in a similar manner to photons, but of course they have even a larger probability to shower in the dead material. Fig. 10 shows the energy distributions for 40 GeV (\(E_{T}\)) electrons at \(\eta=1.1\) obtained by adding various numbers of calorimeter towers.

Even though the low energy tail is significantly smaller by taking a larger calorimeter region, even for \(9\times 9\) cells, the energy resolution is a factor of two worse than at \(\eta\)=0.

The measurement of the low energy electrons is important for process H\({}^{0}\to 4\ell\)'s. Fig. 11 show the energy distributions for 10 GeV (\(E_{T}\)) electrons at various \(\eta\) for cluster size of \(5\times 5\) towers (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.12\times 0.12\)). The tails remain noticeable at low energies (E\({}_{T}\) = 10-20 GeV) even for a cluster size of \(9\times 9\)Figure 9: Ratio between E(ID) - the energy carried out from ID by charged particles and E(cal) - the energy measured by calorimeter: a) for converted photons; b) for \(\pi^{0}\)’s; Ratio E(ID)/E(cal) plotted versus radius of the conversion in the ID: c) for converted photons; d) for \(\pi^{0}\)’s.

Figure 11: “Measured” energy distribution for 10 GeV (E\({}_{T}\)) electrons; a) \(\eta=0\); b) \(\eta=0.76\); c) \(\eta=1.1\); d) \(\eta=1.3\).

towers (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.22\times 0.22\)). Moreover the use of the large cluster sizes may be questionable especially at low energies, because of the pileup and electronic noise. Table 4 summarizes the energy resolution for different \(\eta\) and energy and also lists the effective sampling fraction for each case. The fact that the effective sampling fraction varies shows the non-linearity due to the dead material.

Fig. 12 shows that no significant improvement of the energy resolution can be expected from a correction based on the weighting of the energy deposited in the first longitudinal section of the calorimeter.

The momentum recovery for the electrons which radiate hard \(\gamma\)'s in the ID may be also significantly influenced by quite worse shower position measurement compared to that assumed in [11] (RMS \(\sim\) 5cm/\(\sqrt{E}\) instead of \(\sigma\)=6mm/\(\sqrt{E}\)). Fig. 13 shows tails in the distribution of the shower position for electrons with E\({}_{T}\)=20 GeV at various \(\eta\). At \(\eta\)=1.3, more than 30% of electrons will contribute to the tails and even the events within the peak will show twice worse position resolution than expected in [11]. As a consequence, the E/p cut for the electron identification will be less efficient because of worse resolution for both the shower position and the energy. The events with a large deviation of the measured shower position with respect to the impact point of the electron which did not radiate a hard \(\gamma\), will not be simple and will have on the average 2.3 tracks with at least one of the secondaries having more than 10% of the original electron energy at \(\eta\)=1.3 and \(E_{T}\)=20 GeV.

Conclusions:

* Already at \(\eta\)=0.76 the energy resolution does not comply with the LOI requirements. It degrades to \(\sim\)30%/\(\sqrt{E}\) at \(\eta\)=1.3.
* An increase in the cluster size (to \(7\times 7\)) does not significantly improve the resolution, since, as for converted \(\gamma\)'s, the degradation is mainly connected with the relative amount of energy which is deposited in front of the active calorimeter (\(\sim\)11.5\(\pm\)4% at \(\eta\)=1.1 and \(\sim\)17\(\pm\)5% at \(\eta\)=1.3 for \(E_{T}\)=20 GeV).
* The significantly worse shower position measurement (by an order of magnitude) and the energy resolution (up to three times) than assumed from the beam test (no magnetic field!) and used in [11] to evaluate ATLAS performance, will have an impact on the electron identification.

## 6 The option with the dedicated preshower

We can ask how different will be the above results for the ATLAS Baseline EM calorimeter with the Dedicated Preshower Detector? The best answer will be given by doing a simulation similar to what was done for the integrated preshower.

A somewhat better performance can be expected for the energy resolution, since the first active layer of the dedicated preshower will be placed after a smaller number of \(X_{0}\) (\(\sim\) 3.4 compared to \(\sim\) 4.4 at \(\eta\)=1.3), but there will be also the additional passive material inside cryostat.

Figure 12: Correction of “measured” energy by weighting energy deposited in the first longitudinal section of calorimeter; a) distribution of “measured” energy for 66 GeV electrons at \(\eta=1.1\); b) the same but for 80 GeV electrons at \(\eta=1.3\); c) d) correlation between energy deposited in active medium in the first section and in the whole calorimeter; e) f) energy distributions after correction.

Figure 13: Shower position distribution for 20 GeV (E\({}_{T}\)) electrons (in the bending plane); a) \(\eta\) = 0; b) \(\eta\) = 0.76; c) \(\eta\) = 1.1; d) \(\eta\) = 1.3

The results of the simulation of this option show that: at \(\eta\)=1.3, the energy distribution which includes all \(\gamma\)'s, will have a long low energy tail and can be characterized by \(\sigma/\sqrt{E}\sim 15.5\%\) (RMS/\(\sqrt{E}\sim 33\%\)). For \(\gamma\)'s not converted in ID (63 % of full sample) \(\sigma/\sqrt{E}\)=12%. For electrons, an energy resolution \(\sim\)17%/\(\sqrt{E}\) at \(\eta\)=1.1 and \(\sim\)21%/\(\sqrt{E}\) at \(\eta\)=1.3 were obtained.

However, the \(\phi\) layer of the dedicated preshower will face the same problem as the UV-strips to distinguish the single \(\gamma\)'s converted in front of the coil from \(\pi^{0}\)'s. Its performance to reject \(\pi^{0}\)'s may be very limited at the expense of the largest number of readout channels of all the options. Then the performance of the single \(\eta\) layer would be probably insufficient to suppress \(\pi^{0}\) background to the required level because it is not as deep as the integrated \(\eta\) strips.

Conclusions:

* Even for this somewhat idealized case of the dedicated preshower detector, the energy resolution and \(\pi^{0}\) rejection does not conform to the LOI requirements.

## 7 Summary of Conclusions

* Based on the results of this simulation, we conclude that for the present geometry, the EM calorimeter with LAr as an active medium and with any of the preshower options will not fulfill the LOI requirements. The degradation of the performance in the presence of the magnetic field is due to a combination of the following: the material in ID, the passive material in between ID and the active part of the calorimeter (superconductive coil + cryostat + calorimeter structure) and the length of the barrel. The amount of the material in front of the active part of the EM calorimeter is 1.75-2 times larger than was assumed in the LOI.
* Liquid krypton(LKr) has the potential for energy resolution in the 6%/\(\sqrt{E}\) range, but not with the amount of material assumed here.
* A loss of geometrical acceptance for the EM showers of at least 0.4 unit in \(\eta\) between 1.4 and 1.8 is to be expected in the barrel-endcap transition region. The LOI physics performance evaluation for the process H\({}^{0}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) is based on a study[8] in which this crack was considered to cover only 0.2 unit in \(\eta\).
* The degradation in the \(\pi^{0}\) suppression capability is mainly due to the high \(\gamma\) conversion rates in the ID in the case of any preshower device based on shower shape measurement in \(\phi\) (UV strips and the dedicated preshower). For all versions of the preshower, including one with the \(\eta\)-strips. it is also due to the excess amount of the material in front of the preshower at larger \(\eta\)'s. The LOI requirement for a rejection factor \(>3\) is not fulfilled for 90% \(\gamma\) acceptance at \(\eta\)\(>\) 1.1. With the present amount of material in the ID, \(\eta\) strips offer better performance than the UV strips or the dedicated preshower for equal number of channels.

* A poor calorimeter performance is the result of the non-optimized approach to the integration of ATLAS detector. We should examine the rationale to have an expensive precision EM calorimeter which has intrinsic resolution better then \(9\%/\sqrt{E}\) but then to obtain in the last third of the \(\eta\) coverage 13-18\(\%/\sqrt{E}\) for \(\gamma\)'s and 20-30\(\%/\sqrt{E}\) for electrons. There is probably a more cost effective EM calorimeter technology if this kind of EM calorimeter performance were considered sufficient for the physics goals of ATLAS.
* Since we expect this poor EM calorimeter performance to have nonnegligible effect on the ATLAS physics performance we suggest that in order to meet the physics goals of ATLAS. changes in geometry need to be considered.
* We realize that significant changes in the ATLAS design cannot be solely based only on this simulation. We however already know, that the poor performance for \(\gamma\)'s has been confirmed by simulations made at CERN by G.Parrour and P.Petroff [12]. We believe that the overall geometrical acceptance, the energy resolution for electrons as well as \(\pi^{0}\) suppression have to be verified also (within a resonable time scale). Otherwise we will be moving toward the TDR with a design that is not defensible.

The challenge now is to make progress on three fronts:

i) The material in the tracker weighted by its radial position, needs to be reduced. If distributed accordingly \(\sim 0.3\) X\({}_{0}\) may be acceptable.

ii) The total amount of passive material in front of the calorimeter should be kept below or near 2X\({}_{0}\).

iii) Figs. 14 and 15 show that even if the goals of the previous two items are met, the performance of the calorimeter will start to deteriorate at \(\eta\)=1.3. The extent in \(\eta\) of good performance depends on the progress on the first two items.

We hope this note will stimulate the necessary discussions.
