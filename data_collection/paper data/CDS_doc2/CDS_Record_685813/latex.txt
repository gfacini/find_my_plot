**Current Understanding**

**of the**

**Muon Level-1 System**

## 1 Purpose of this note.

The muon level-1 electronics consists of an on-detector part (Sector logic, RPC and TGC responsibility) and of an off-detector part (Muon Interface, Cern responsibility). As a consequence there are 3 interfaces (Cern/RPC, Cern/TGC and RPC/TGC) which require a clear understanding. An important issue is the overlapping between the different parts which leads to a possible double counting of muons. This note describes the present understanding of the muon level-1 system as seen by the off-detector electronics. It gives a proposal for the data transmission format between the on-detector and the off-detector electronics. Any feedback is very welcome.

## 2 RPC trigger segmentation.

The barrel RPC is segmented in 2 in eta and 32 in phi trigger sectors.

Sectors in phi are of two different sizes. An octant is shown in figure 1. Each Trigger sector is divided in 24 sub-sectors as shown in figure 2. Due to some limitation in the front-end electronics, one cannot have more than 1 muon candidate in each pad (set of 4 sub-sectors) as shown on figure 2. In case of multiple muon candidates in a pad, only the highest Pt candidate is kept and a flag is set.

One keeps only 2 muon candidates by sectors. If there are more, the two highest Pt candidates are kept and a flag is set.

There is an overlap in phi between sectors belonging to different chambers, e.g. between sectors 2k-1 and 2k if one uses the sector numbering convention shown in figure 1. When a muon candidate is in an overlap region, a flag indicates it allowing the off-detector electronics to handle it. Possible overlaps within one sector are handled by the on-detector electronics.

## 3 TGC trigger segmentation.

The TGC Trigger is divided into two parts: the forward (inner) and the end-cap (outer) regions. The number of trigger sectors in the forward part is 24. The end-cap part is divided in 48 equal sectors as shown on figure 3 (one octant). There is no overlap in phi or eta between the end-cap sectors. There is overlap in eta between the end-cap sectors and the barrel sectors.

The maximum number of sub-sectors in the end-cap sectors is determined by the on-detector electronics granularity and is 196. The maximum number of sub-sectors in the forward sectors is 60.

## 4 End-cap / Barrel Overlap.

The overlap between the end-cap sectors and the barrel sectors must be treated in an efficient way to avoid double counting of low Pt muons. Figure 4 shows the mapping in phi between the barrel and end-cap sectors. As one can see it is possible to treat them as follows:

## 5 Data Format proposal.

As mentionned earlier, the total number of sub-sectors within one trigger sector is at most 196. This requires an 8-bit coding and leads to the following data format proposal for the transmission between the on-detector electronics and off-detector electronics.

\begin{tabular}{l|l l} \hline _Bit \#_ & _Meaning_ & _Comments_ \\ \hline
0 & \(>\)2 candidates in the sector & \\
1..9 & ROI1 and overlaps bits & See details below \\
10..18 & ROI2 and overlaps bits & See details below \\
19..21 & Pt1 & Encoded Pt value \\
22..24 & Pt2 & Encoded Pt value \\
25 & More than one candidate in ROI1 & \\
26 & More than one Candidate in ROI2 & \\

**Note 4.** Three bits for the BCID should be enough for checking purposes as it is very unlikely to have a misalignment greater than 8 BC. They are the low order bits of the BCID provided by the TTC system (TTCrx receiver chips or equivallent).
