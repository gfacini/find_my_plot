**Prospects for the measurement of the rare Higgs boson decay \(H\to\mu\mu\) with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions collected at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV by the ATLAS experiment**

The ATLAS Collaboration

This note presents a study of the prospects for the measurement of the rare Higgs boson decay \(H\to\mu\mu\) using 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the high-luminosity LHC. The studies assume an average number of interactions per bunch crossing \(\langle\mu\rangle=200\). The \(H\to\mu\mu\) signal from gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion is expected to be observed with a significance of more than 9 standard deviations. The uncertainty on the Higgs production cross section times the branching ratio to dimuons normalised by the Standard Model prediction is expected to be around 13%.

## 1 Introduction

In July 2012 a Higgs boson with mass near 125 GeV was discovered by ATLAS and CMS through its decays to di-boson final states, \(H\to\gamma\gamma\), \(H\to ZZ\) and \(H\to WW\)[1, 2]. The analysis of the full Run 1 data collected by ATLAS and CMS [3] consolidated these results and also provided observation of decays to the leptonic final state \(\tau\tau\) and evidence of the fermionic final state \(b\bar{b}\). All the observed rates so far, even exploiting the 13 TeV\(pp\) collisions collected by ATLAS and CMS in 2015 and 2016, are consistent with the Standard Model (SM) predictions. This is also the case for the measured \(J^{P}\) properties of this particle, for which the SM \(0^{+}\) hypothesis is favored over various alternatives, including \(0^{-}\), \(1^{\pm}\), and \(2^{+}\) models [4, 5].

The final states and production modes observed so far are induced by the Higgs boson couplings to either the massive vector bosons (\(W,Z\)) or to third-generation fermions, either quarks (\(b\), \(t\)) or leptons (\(\tau\)). To search for possible deviations from the SM predictions and also to expand the set of measurements of the properties of the discovered particle, it is thus natural to turn to the couplings of the Higgs boson with the other fermion families. In the SM, the largest among such couplings is that to the charm quark, but due to the huge QCD background this is not easily accessible at the LHC. The \(H\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decay is an excellent candidate for such a search, with its small but not insignificant cross section times branching ratio (13.6 fb at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV [6]), smaller backgrounds and excellent invariant mass resolution that allows discrimination between signal and background. The limiting factor to the sensitivity of this search is the small expected signal yield and the very large contribution from the irreducible Drell-Yan background, \(pp\to Z+X\), \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\).

With the full dataset collected in Run 1, ATLAS and CMS were not able to find an evidence of a signal, and set upper limits on the product of the Higgs boson production cross section times muonic branching ratio of 7.0 and 7.4 times the SM expectation, respectively [7, 8]. With about 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions collected by ATLAS at 13 TeV during the LHC Run 2, the observed (expected) upper limit on the cross section times branching ratio is 3.0 (3.1) times the SM prediction at the 95% confidence level for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV [9]. When combining together the ATLAS Run 1 and Run 2 results, the observed (expected) upper limit is 2.8 (2.9) times the SM prediction.

The sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment to this decay is studied here for a Higgs boson with a mass of \(m_{H}=125\) GeV, assuming an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. An average number of 200 additional inelastic \(pp\) collisions per bunch-crossing (denoted "pile-up"in the rest of the note) is assumed. The analysis is based on a selection and event classification similar to that used for the Run 1 and Run 2 ATLAS searches, and updates the studies documented in Ref. [10], which were based on a simpler strategy without event categories, and assumed an average of 140 pile-up collisions per bunch-crossing (\(\langle\mu\rangle=140\)). The analysis uses generator-level samples of the main signal and background processes, combined with parametrisations of the detector performance (muon and jet reconstruction and selection efficiencies and momentum resolutions) obtained from fully simulated samples. The parametric resolutions are used to smear the generator-level particle transverse momenta, while the parametric efficiencies are used to reweigh the selected events. Compared to the previous study of Ref. [10], updated parametrizations of the ATLAS detector efficiencies and resolutions at the high-luminosity LHC - as described in the ATLAS Scoping Document [11] - have been used.

The three possible scenarios of detector upgrades presented in the ATLAS Scoping Document, defined by different costs and different performance and coverage, in term of pseudorapidity \(\eta\) regions, are investigated by using the same event selection and classification. Results for the "reference" detector scenario, definedby an inner tracker coverage up to \(|\eta|=4.0\), and for a muon selection limited to \(|\eta|<2.5\), as in the ATLAS Run 1 and Run 2 analyses, are reported in the main text. The main results for the "low" and "middle"scenarios, characterised by reduced acceptance of the inner tracking system with respect to the reference scenario, and for the "reference" scenario with a muon selection extended to the range \(|\eta|<4.0\), are also summarised succintly in the main text (Sec. 6), while more details are provided in Appendix A.

## 2 MC Samples

The analysis is performed on generator-level samples of the main signal and background processes. The generated samples, including their theoretical cross sections for \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, and their equivalent luminosities, used to normalise each sample to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), are summarised in Table 1.

For the \(H\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) signal the Higgs boson mass is assumed to be \(m_{H}=125\) GeV. Only the dominant gluon fusion and VBF production modes are taken into account. The sum of their SM cross sections (taken from Ref. [6]), computed at N3LO (for ggF) or approximate NNLO (for VBF) in QCD with NLO electroweak corrections,

\[\sigma_{\rm ggF}+\sigma_{\rm VBF}=58.95\ {\rm pb}, \tag{1}\]

constitutes about 94% of the total SM Higgs boson production cross section (62.61 pb). The remaining 6% is due to \(WH\) (2.4%), \(ZH\) (1.6%), \(ttH\) and \(bbH\) (1% each), where the \(WH\) and \(ZH\) cross sections are computed at NNLO in QCD with NLO EW corrections included, while the \(ttH\) and \(bbH\) cross sections are computed at NLO in QCD. The theoretical values of the production cross sections, including their uncertainties, used for this study are listed in Table 2.

Both signal samples are generated with POWHEG [12, 13] interfaced to PYTHIA8 [14] for showering, hadronization and modeling of the underlying event. The Higgs boson is forced to decay to dimuons. The branching ratio predicted by the SM for \(m_{H}=125\) GeV is

\[BR_{\rm SM}(H\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-})=(2.18\pm 0.05)\times 10^{-4}\,. \tag{2}\]

Fifty thousand events are generated for both ggF and VBF production modes, corresponding to integrated luminosities of about 5 and 50 ab\({}^{-1}\), respectively.

The main backgrounds to the signal under study are due to processes that produce isolated muon pairs in the final state. They are, in decreasing order of relevance after the final selection:

* Drell-Yan events, \(pp\to\gamma/Z^{*}X\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}X\) (also denoted "\(Z\)+jets" events in the following);
* leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) decays: \(pp\to t\bar{t}X\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}b\bar{b}\nu\bar{\nu}X\);
* leptonic \(WW\) decays: \(pp\to W^{+}W^{-}X\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}X\).

The production of \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) in association with jets is generated with ALPGEN [15]. Up to five partons are produced in the hard scattering processes, with matrix elements implemented at LO. The \(Z\) boson is forced to decay to dimuons. The production of \(t\bar{t}\) and \(WW\) pairs are generated with MC@NLO [16; 17]. Both ALPGEN and MC@NLO are interfaced to HERWIG [18] for parton showering, fragmentation into particles and to model the underlying event, using JIMMY [19] to generate multiple-parton interactions.

Two sets of \(Z(\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\)+jet samples are produced. A first one, used to study events passing the final selection, which includes a dimuon invariant mass requirement \(m_{\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}>110\) GeV, is produced with a generator-level dimuon invariant mass, before final-state-radiation, greater than 100 GeV, and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of at least 35 fb\({}^{-1}\). A second set of \(Z\)+jet samples, used to study the background \(m_{\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\) distribution in a region around the \(Z\) boson mass pole, is produced with a generator-level minimum dimuon invariant mass of 60 GeV and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of about 3 fb\({}^{-1}\). The samples are normalised by scaling the cross sections predicted by ALPGEN by an inclusive \(k\)-factor obtained as the ratio between the inclusive production cross section for \(Z/\gamma^{*}(\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\)+jet events (2114 pb) from a calculation performed with MCFM [20] at NNLO in QCD for the study reported in Ref. [10], and the sum of the ALPGEN \(Z(\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\)+n parton production cross sections (1822 pb) for the same \(m_{\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\)>60 GeV requirement.

Nine \(W^{+}W^{-}\) samples are produced correponding to the possible combinations of the different \(W^{\pm}\) leptonic decays. The samples are normalised using an NLO calculation of the \(W^{+}W^{-}\to\mu^{+}\nu_{\mu}\mu^{-}\bar{\nu}_{\mu}\) cross section (1.419 pb for each leptonic final state) performed with MCFM for the study reported in Ref. [10], and correspond to a luminosity of about 240 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Generated \(t\bar{t}\) events are filtered by requiring that at least one top produces a \(W\) boson that decays leptonically. The \(t\bar{t}\) production cross section from a NNLL+approximate NNLO calculation is 896 pb (for \(m_{t}=173.3\) GeV), with about 8.5% uncertainty. The generated number of \(t\bar{t}\) events corresponds to an integrated luminosity of about 24 fb\({}^{-1}\).

## 3 Analysis strategy

The analysis proceeds through the following steps:

* an event selection aimed at keeping a high signal efficiency while suppressing as much as possible the backgrounds;
* an event classification to split the selected sample in subsets with different signal-to-background ratios (\(S/B\)) in order to improve the total sensitivity of the search;
* a maximum likelihood fit to the di-muon invariant mass distribution of the selected events, to estimate the signal yield and its uncertainty. The fit exploits the property that the invariant mass distribution of background events does not peak at the Higgs boson mass value, unlike the signal.

Systematic uncertainties are incorporated as nuisance parameters in the final fit, as described later. In the following, the three steps of the analysis are briefly reviewed.

### Event selection

The following selection criteria are applied to the generated signal and background events after having applied the parametric efficiency and resolution corrections. The criteria are similar to those used in the Run 1 and Run 2 analyses, but the jet requirements are tighter to cope with the significantly larger number of pile-up jets.

* Events are required to have exactly one pair of reconstructed and identified opposite-sign muons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>15\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\). The muon reconstruction and identification efficiency is estimated to be 54% for \(|\eta|<0.1\) and 97% for \(|\eta|>0.1\). Muons overlapping with good jets within a cone of radius of \(\Delta R=0.4\) are ignored, where good jets are defined as all jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV passing the track-confirmation algorithm aimed at suppressing pile-up jets. This algorithm uses the tracking information by looking at the ratio \(R_{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\) of the scalar \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) sum of the tracks that are associated with the jet and originate from the event primary vertex divided by the fully calibrated jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). Small ratios typically arise from pile-up jets, while the ratio is larger for jets from the primary interaction. More details on this method, which in the following is referred to as track-confirmation (TC), and on its performance for different detector layouts are given in Ref. [11]. The track-confirmation requirements are applied to jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<100\) GeV and pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<3.8\).
* The leading-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) muon must have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV.
* The event should pass single or dimuon triggers, which have transverse momentum thresholds of 20 GeV and 11 GeV, respectively. The typical single muon trigger efficiency is around 96% for \(|\eta|<2.4\), with the exception of the region \(|\eta|<0.05\) where it drops to 77%, and is 0 for \(|\eta|>2.4\) due to the absence of fast muon chambers with triggering capability.
* For the extraction of the final results from a fit to the di-muon invariant mass, selected events are required to have \(110<m_{\mu\mu}<160\) GeV.

The previous requirements define the nominal "signal region". A \(Z\)+jet "control region" is also defined by applying the same requirements with the exception of the di-muon invariant mass selection, which is changed to \(87<m_{\mu\mu}<117\) GeV.

### Event classification

Events are classified in seven orthogonal categories: one VBF-like category based on the presence of two forward jets with large rapidity gap and six categories based on the muon pseudorapidity and di-muon transverse momentum, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mu\mu}\). The Run 1 category definition is used, with the exception of the VBF-like category, whose definition has been reoptimised. Events considered as VBF candidates must still contain two high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets, and the two leading-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets are required to be in opposite hemispheres (\(\eta_{j1}\eta_{j2}<0\)), but the criteria applied on the minimum invariant mass and the minimum pseudorapidity separation between the leading-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and subleading-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jet have been tightened. Additional requirements are also applied to:

* the minimum value of the di-muon transverse momentum, since the muon pair from the Higgs boson in a VBF event is recoiling against the two quark-jets and is on average more boosted than muons from Higgs bosons produced through gluon fusion, and
* the maximum value of the quantity \(\eta^{*}=|\eta_{\mu\mu}-\frac{\eta_{j1}+\eta_{j2}}{2}|\).

The optimisation is performed iteratively, by fixing the requirements on 3 of the four variables \(m_{jj}\), \(|\Delta\eta_{jj}|\), \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mu\mu}\) and \(\eta^{*}\) and finding the value of the cut on the fourth variable that maximises the VBF significance, computed as \(N_{\mathrm{VBF}}/\sqrt{N_{\mathrm{VBF}}+N_{\mathrm{ggF}}+B}\) in the VBF-like category. The requirement on the scanned variable is then fixed and the optimisation then proceeds to the next one. Only 2 iterations are performed, in the following order: \(m_{jj}\rightarrow|\Delta\eta_{jj}|\to p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mu\mu} \rightarrow\eta^{*}\rightarrow|\Delta\eta_{jj}|\to m_{jj}\).

The final requirements for the VBF-like category are the following

* \(m_{jj}>650\) GeV,
* \(|\Delta\eta_{jj}|>3.6\),
* \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mu\mu}>80\) GeV,
* \(\eta^{*}<2.0\).

The events not passing the VBF-like category are classified as either "central" or "non-central" whether both muons have \(|\eta|<1\) (and thus better \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) resolution) or not. These two sub-samples are both split in three categories based on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mu\mu}\):

* low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mu\mu}\): \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mu\mu}<15\) GeV,
* medium-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mu\mu}\): \(15<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mu\mu}<50\) GeV,
* high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mu\mu}\): \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mu\mu}>50\) GeV,

to exploit the fact that signal events have on average larger di-muon transverse momentum than \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) background events.

### Signal extraction

The final results are obtained from a simultaneous fit to the invariant mass distribution of the seven event categories for events in the signal region. The signal yield \(S\) and the background yield \(B\) in each category, as well as the background shape parameters (except for the \(Z\) lineshape ones), are floating in the fit.

Given the large number of events, a binned fit (with a sufficiently narrow binning compared to the excellent signal resolution) is performed, in order to reduce drastically the CPU time needed for the fit. The chosen binning is 0.1 GeV.

Two fits are performed:

1. an inclusive fit to all selected events, without categories, in which there is a single parameter of interest, the signal strength \(\mu\) \[\mu=\frac{S}{S^{\text{SM}}}\,,\] (3) defined as the ratio between the observed signal yield \(S\) and its SM expectation, \(S^{\text{SM}}\);
2. a simultaneous fit to the selected events classified in the seven categories, using for each one its own signal and background model, with a single parameter of interest \(\mu\).

Systematic uncertainties are incorporated in the likelihood function \(L\) by introducing a nuisance parameter \(\theta\) for each source of uncertainty, so that the signal and background expectations (yields or parameters of the model) become functions of \(\theta\). A "penalty" or "constraint" term, which exploits the present estimate or guess of each systematic uncertainty, is then included as a multiplicative factor in the likelihood function. The nuisance parameters are then fitted ("profiled") to the data, together with the parameter(s) of interest, when minimizing \(-\log L\). The systematic uncertainties that are considered in this study are the theoretical uncertainties (currently around 5%) and the experimental luminosity uncertainty (expected to be around 3%). Other systematic uncertainties related to the background modelling and lepton identification efficiency are expected to be small and neglected in this note. Studies performed using 5000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of background MC samples produced at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV for the analysis of the Run 2 data [9] show no evidence of a significant bias on the fitted signal yield induced by the choice of the background parametrization, and this effect is neglected. With such samples the statistical uncertainty on the estimated bias itself is around 30%. Much larger samples (around 50 ab\({}^{-1}\)) are needed in order to reach a significantly smaller uncertainty on this estimated bias and verify that it is indeed negligible with respect to the other uncertainties considered in this document.

The likelihood function includes nuisance parameters for the theoretical uncertainties on the SM \(H\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) branching ratio and on the Higgs production cross sections, separately for gluon-fusion and VBF and separating effects due to the PDF uncertainties from those due to the choice of the renormalisation and factorisation scales in the fixed order calculations. The nominal uncertainties used in the fit are those given in Table 2 and in Eq. 2. A 3% uncertainty on the luminosity is also included. For all the uncertainties, Gaussian constraints are used, since the uncertainties are symmetric or only slightly skewed.

In order to estimate the median expected results and uncertainties, Asimov datasets are created for the signal and background, scaling the fitted signal and background models to the desired luminosity, and then combined.

#### 3.3.1 Signal model

The signal di-muon invariant mass distribution is parametrised with the sum of a Crystal-Ball function and a Gaussian one. The peak position of the two functions are the same for all the seven categories. The parameters are extracted from a simultaneous unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the selected signal events, and then fixed in the final fit.

The signal model fits are illustrated in Fig. 1.

#### 3.3.2 Background model

The background di-muon invariant mass distribution is parametrised with the sum of an exponential function and the convolution of a Breit-Wigner function (whose mass and width parameters are fixed to the nominal \(Z\) pole ones) with a Gaussian resolution function.

The Gaussian resolution in each category is extracted through a simultaneous fit to the di-muon invariant mass distribution of simulated \(Z\)+jet events in the \(Z\)+jet control region selected in each category, with the model just described after removing the exponential component.

The nominal values of the parameters of the full background model (slope and relative normalisation of the exponential function) are extracted from unbinned maximum likelihood fits to the invariant mass distribution of the selected background events in the signal region, summing together the contribution from Drell-Yan, \(t\bar{t}\) and \(WW\), normalised to their respective SM cross sections. The parameters of the nominal background model will be used in the following to generate background distribution corresponding to high integrated luminosities, in order to overcome the limitations from the small (35-150 fb\({}^{-1}\)) equivalent luminosity of the generated Drell-Yan MC samples.

In the final \(S+B\) fit the slope and relative normalisation of the exponential function, as well as the background yields in each category, will be floating, in order to mimic the procedure adopted in data to extract the background parameters _in situ_, essentially exploiting the large background in the sidebands of the di-muon invariant mass distribution.

The \(Z\) lineshape fits in the range \(87<m_{\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}<117\) GeV, for an integrated luminosity of 3 fb\({}^{-1}\) (the equivalent luminosity of the Drell-Yan MC samples with a generator-level dimuon mass greater than 60 GeV) are illustrated in Fig. 2.

The background fits used to extract the nominal parameters are illustrated in Fig. 3.

## 4 Results for the reference detector scenario

The expected signal and background yields after the various selection requirements are given in Table 3. The overall signal efficiency is 59% (59% for ggF events and 62% for VBF ones). The expected background overwhelms the signal: the \(B/S\) ratio in the signal region is \(\approx 1800\), and it is \(\approx 270\) in a \(\pm 1.5\sigma_{G}\) invariant-mass window around \(m_{\mu\mu}=125\) GeV, where \(\sigma_{G}\) is the resolution of the core of the invariant mass distribution of signal events.

The expected transverse momentum and pseudorapidy distributions of the selected muons are shown in Fig. 4. The expected transverse momentum and pseudorapidy distributions of the leading and subleading jets in events with at least two good jets are shown in Fig. 5. The large increase of selected jets for \(|\eta|>3.8\) is due to pile-up jets not being vetoed by the track confirmation algorithm.

The expected signal and background dimuon invariant mass and transverse momentum distributions after the selection are illustrated in Figs. 6 (in the invariant mass range 70-270 GeV) and 7 (in the invariant mass range 110-160 GeV, used for the final fit).

The VBF-like category has an efficiency of about 14% for VBF signal events passing the selection. The VBF fraction of signal in the VBF-like category is around 51%; it is 1% in the low-\(p_{\rm T}^{\mu\mu}\) categories, 4% in the central-\(p_{\rm T}^{\mu\mu}\) and 13% in the high-\(p_{\rm T}^{\mu\mu}\) categories.

The expected yields in each category for \(110<m_{\mu\mu}<160\) GeV are given in Table 4.

The expected signal and background yields and signal significance for each event category, in a \(m_{\mu\mu}\) window of \(\pm 1.5\sigma\) around 125 GeV, are given in Table 5. The total signal significance (from the sum in quadrature of \(S/\sqrt{S+B}\) in a window of \(\pm 1.5\sigma\) around 125 GeV) is \(9.5\sigma\).

The result of the simultaneous fit to the seven event categories with one parameter of interest is illustrated in Fig. 8. Due to the huge background, the signal is only visible when subtracting the fitted background from the data, as illustrated in the bottom plot of the same figure.

The fitted signal strength in the inclusive fit is equal to \(\mu=1.00\pm 0.15\).

The fitted signal strength in the simultaneous fit to the event categories is equal to \(\mu=1.00\pm 0.13\). Compared to the inclusive fit the uncertainties are reduced by \(\approx 12\%\).

Redoing the fits without systematic uncertainties (_i.e._ without theory uncertainties and the luminosity uncertainty) yields:

* fitted signal strength in the fit to the inclusive sample: \(\mu=1.00\pm 0.14\).
* fitted signal strength in the fit to the event categories: \(\mu=1.00\pm 0.12\).

In the Appendix A the impact of extending the \(|\eta|\) range for the muon selection from 2.5 to 4.0, profiting from the extended tracker coverage, is also evaluated.

## 5 Validation with fully-simulated MC Samples

In this section the kinematic distributions of the selected muons and jets obtained by applying parametrised efficiency and resolution functions to generator-level events are compared to the same distributions obtained by applying the ATLAS reconstruction algorithms to a detailed GEANT4 simulation of the detector response. The comparison is limited to the signal samples, and provides a cross check of the validity of the simplified approach based on the parametrised efficiency and resolution functions. Only the shapes of the distributions are compared: in all the figures, the distributions are normalised to the same area.

The kinematic distributions (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), \(\eta\), \(\phi\)) of the selected muon candidates, as well as their ratio, are shown in Figure 9.

Figure 10 shows the invariant mass and transverse momentum distributions of the selected muon pairs.

Kinematic distributions of the selected jet pairs belonging to the VBF-dedicated category are shown in Figure 11. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with a distance parameter of 0.4 [21] and fully calibrated. In the study based on full simulation samples, two alternative methods are adopted to suppress pile-up jets. The first one uses the same parametrisation of the efficiency of the track confirmation algorithm (described in the Section 3) applied in the analysis presented in the previous and following sections. The corresponding distributions in the figures are labelled as "Full Sim, with TC". The second one uses an an explicit evaluation of the \(R_{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\) variable, on which the track confirmation algorithm is based, using tracks and jets from the full simulation. The corresponding distributions in the figures are labelled as "Full Sim, with Rpt".

Figure 12 shows the same distributions of Figure 11 but only for jets produced by the hard scattering (HS) process. A reconstructed jet is considered to be produced by the HS if a true HS jet is found inside a cone of radius 0.3 in \(\eta-\phi\) centered on the axis of the reconstructed jet.

The shapes of the muon and jet kinematic distributions are in good agreement between the full simulation and the generator-level events corrected with parametrised efficiency and resolution functions.

The bottom panels show the ratio between the two distributions shown in the top panels. The distributions are normalised to the same area.

## 6 Summary

An updated study has been presented of the prospects for the measurement of the rare Higgs boson decay \(H\to\mu\mu\) using 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the high-luminosity LHC. The studies assume an average number of interactions per bunch crossing \(\langle\mu\rangle=200\) and the latest performance assumptions for the various subdetectors, in three different upgrade scenarios.

The muonic Higgs boson decay has not been observed yet and constitutes the best way at the LHC to access the couplings of the Higgs boson to fermions of the second generation of matter particles.

The results for the estimated signal significance and the uncertainty on the signal strength are summarised in Table 6.

The muon efficiencies and resolutions between the three detector upgrade scenarios in the selected phase space are quite similar. This translates in significances that improve only slightly between the different scenarios. The overall signal strength uncertainties are very similar in all three scenarios.

No significant gain is found (without further re-optimisation) for the reference detector scenario when selecting muons with rapidities up to 4.0 instead of 2.5 as in the default analysis, due to the poor muon momentum resolution translating into a poor signal-vs-background separation in the distribution of the discriminating variable \(m_{\mu\mu}\).

Finally, the comparison with the full simulation samples method based on parametrized efficiency and resolution functions.

## Appendix A Results for alternative detector scenarios or selections

Alternative scenarios with reduced coverage of the inner tracking detector, or with an extended pseudorapidity selection for muons, have also been explored:

* "low" scenario: inner tracking detector acceptance reduced to \(|\eta|<2.5\),
* "middle" scenario: inner tracking detector acceptance reduced to \(|\eta|<3.2\),
* "extended" scenario: reference detector, with muon pseudorapidity selection extended to \(|\eta|<4.0\).

The main results about these alternative scenarios, in terms of expected significance and uncertainty on the signal strengths, have been given in Sec. 6. In this appendix a few more details are provided.

The reduction of the inner tracking detector acceptance has, as a major consequence, the reduction in pile-up jet rejection, which relies on tracking information. This is illustrated in Fig. 13. The purity of VBF signal events in the VBF category is thus worsened, as well as the signal efficiency for the "low" scenario, due to more muons with \(|\eta|\) close to 2.5 being discarded by the jet-muon overlap algorithm with respect to the "reference" detector scenario.

In addition to the reduced inner detector acceptance, the "low" and "middle" scenarios are also characterised by lower muon trigger efficiencies and higher muon trigger \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds (25 GeV instead of 20 GeV for the single muon trigger and 15 GeV instead of 11 GeV for the dimuon trigger). The track momentum resolution of the "low" detector scenario is also worse than in the other cases due to a reduced number of layers in the inner tracking detector.

In the case of the extended scenario, the selection of muon candidates has been loosened to accept muon with absolute pseudorapidity up to 4, as shown in Fig. 14. This translates into a larger signal efficiency. However, the muon momentum resolution for \(2.5<|\eta|<4.0\) is significantly worse than for \(|\eta|<2.5\), which implies a rather worse signal-to-background ratio for events with at least one forward muon (\(2.5<|\eta|<4.0\)), as the peaks from the Higgs boson (signal) and \(Z\) boson (background) decays to dimuons are significantly smeared and their separation is decreased, as shown in Fig. 15. For this reason, in the case of the extended scenario, events with at least one forward muon are classified in three "forward" categories of their own, distinguished by the value of the dimuon transverse momentum in the same way as for the "central" and "non-central" ones. The signal model fits for the three forward categories are illustrated in Fig. 16. The signal invariant mass resolution for events with forward muons is at least two times worse than for events with both muon pseudorapidities within \(\pm 2.5\).

The overall signal efficiency for the three alternative scenarios is:

* "low" scenario: 55% (55% for ggF events and 58% for VBF ones);
* "middle" scenario: 58% (58% for ggF events and 61% for VBF ones);
* "extended" scenario: 68% (68% for ggF events and 71% for VBF ones).
