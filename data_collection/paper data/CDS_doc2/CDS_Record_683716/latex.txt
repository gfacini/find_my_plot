**Introduction:**

This note presents the characterization of the 52 new R5900 8 stages Hamamatsu photomultipliers which have been used during the 1998 Tilecal test beam. The PMTs have been measured in the test bench prototype [1] using a procedure very close to the one foreseen for the characterization of the ten thousand PMTs for ATLAS. Special dividers have been used for the quantum efficiency, amplification in DC mode and relative photocathode sensitivity measurements. Standard dividers have been used for the amplification in pulsed mode, dark current and linearity measurements.

**1.Quantum Efficiency**

For the July 98 test beam 52 new R5900 8 stages PMTs have been used, with new making process and new photocathode window material. These modifications are lead to an improvement of the quantum efficiency compared to the previous generations of PMTs. An increase from 16% to 18.5% will be shown from the results of our measurements.

We have done the Q.E. measurement for all the PMTs in the test bench prototype. The procedure consists in measuring, using a slow ADC, the current generated by the PMT operated in photocathode mode and to compare it with the current registered by a photodiode for the same quantity of light. A large area (18x18 \(mm^{2}\)) Hamamatsu photodiode (ref. S3204-04) was used. This photodiode was previously calibrated at several wavelengths by Hamamatsu. At 480nm, the Q.E. was estimated to be 70.1%. In order to equalize the light we had to intercalibrate each light channel; it was done by moving the PMTs from their channel to the reference point. In order to get the photocathode mode we used the special dividers which have relays that allow to select between the anode and photocathode mode.

In this case the Q.E. is proportional to the current, so we have the relation:

\[Q\,E_{P\,MT}=QE_{PD}\times\frac{I_{P\,MT}\times C_{i}}{I_{PD}} \tag{1}\]

where \(C_{i}\) are the calibration coefficients between the PMT channels and the photodiode channel, and \(I_{PMT}\) and \(I_{PD}\) are the current registered in the photomultiplier and photodiode respectivily. The results of the calibration are given in table 1. Figure 1 shows the position of all the elements used for the measurement.

The repeatibility of the calibration shows a variation of calibration factors less than 1%. Doing the calibration with another set of PMTs the variation in the calibration coefficients are less than 2%. So we can conclude that our quantum efficiency measurement are done with an accuracy of around 2%. Figure 2 shows the Hamamatsu results together with our results. Figure 3 represents the correlation between them.

## 2. Relative Photocathode sensitivity

The measurement of the relative photocathode sensitivity was done for twenty PMTs only. We put the LED in DC mode and the special dividers in photocathode mode. We measured the current for each applied voltage between the photocathode and the first dynode, from 0 to 95 volts aproximately. Results are shown in figure 4.

**3. Current amplification in DC Mode**

The PMTs are operated during the test beam at the nominal amplification of \(10^{5}\). That is why it is crucial to know what is the nominal voltage associated to this gain. It is also very important to know the variation of the gain with the high voltage for the intercalibration of the cells in the module (gain setting).

In order to measure the current amplification, we illuminate the photomultiplier with a DC light. Then we measure the anode current and photocathode current with the same light-flux. The gain of the photomultiplier is then given by:

\[Gain=\frac{I_{\it anode}}{I_{\it pk}} \tag{2}\]

where \(I_{\it anode}\) is the current measured in the normal operating condition and \(I_{\it pk}\) is the current measured without amplification.

These measurements are done using the special dividers, which allow to switch between the two operating modes: anode or photocathode mode. We did the measurements covering a range of \(\pm 150\) volts around the nominal voltage. The results are shown in figure 5 and the distribution of the nominal high voltage for a gain of \(10^{5}\) are plotted in figure 6.

Some PMTs present a down deviation at hight voltages respect to the behavior \(lgG=lg\alpha+\beta lgV,\) this is due to the saturation of the electronic with the big quantity of charge produced.

## 4. Amplification in Pulsed Mode

Amplication measurement in pulsed mode is based in the statistical result on the number of photoelectrons [4, 5]:

\[N_{pe}=(\frac{\mu-\mu_{ped}}{\sigma})^{2} \tag{3}\]

where \(\mu\) represents the mean value of the distribution, \(\mu_{ped}\) the pedestal, and \(\sigma\) the sigma of the distribution. Knowing the number of photoelectrons, the Gain (G) of the PMT is obtained from the PMT output charge in Coulomb Q:

\[N_{pe}\times G\times 1.6\times 10^{-19}=Q \tag{4}\]

To perform PMT amplification in pulsed mode we associate to each PMT a standard divider. The LED was operated with 1kHz frequency and 20ns wide. The signals were measured by the use of a charge ADC.

There is a clear discrepancy between the values obtained in DC and in Pulsed mode. The _noise factor_ correction, due to the statistical noise in the amplification procedure, can explain part of the differencies. Additional discrepancy could come from the DC mode procedure, where collection efficiency is ignored when measuring photocathode current. Figure 7 shows the distribution of amplification measured in pulsed mode and the same values, but corrected by the _noise factor_.

* **Noise factor correction.**

Assuming cascade events statistics in the dynode amplification in our PMTs we have the following expressions for the gain and fluctuation [3]:

\[\langle m_{8}\rangle=\prod_{i=1}^{i=8}k_{i} \tag{5}\]

and

\[\sigma^{2}_{\langle m_{8}\rangle}=(\langle m_{8}\rangle)^{2}\times[\frac{\sigma ^{2}_{k1}}{k_{1}^{2}}+\frac{\sigma^{2}_{k2}}{k_{1}k_{2}^{2}}+...\frac{\sigma^{ 2}_{k8}}{(k_{1}k_{2}...k_{7}k_{8}^{2}}] \tag{6}\]

where _k\({}_{i}\)_ means the gain between dynodes i-1 and i, and \(\sigma_{k\,i}\) the variance. Defining F, the noise factor as:

\[F=[\frac{\sigma^{2}_{k1}}{k_{1}^{2}}+\frac{\sigma^{2}_{k\,2}}{k_{1}k_{2}^{2}} +...\frac{\sigma^{2}_{k\,8}}{k_{1}k_{2}....k_{7}k_{8}^{2}}] \tag{7}\]

and for the anode:\[N_{a} = N_{pk}\times k_{1}\times k_{2}\times...\times k_{8} \tag{8}\]

\[\sigma_{Na}^{2}=\langle m_{8}\rangle^{2}\sigma_{Npe}^{2}+N_{pe}\sigma_{\langle m8 \rangle}^{2}=\langle m_{8}\rangle^{2}\sigma_{N_{\gamma}}^{2}+N_{\gamma}\sigma_{m8} ^{2} \tag{9}\]

After some straightforward calculations:

\[(\frac{N_{a}}{\sigma_{Na}})^{2}=N_{pe}\times\frac{1}{1+F} \tag{10}\]

so, the noise factor corrected amplification is simply scaled by the factor 1/(1+F).

In this study we have used the 2:2:1:1:1:2:3:2 repartition, so the expresion (7) becomes:

\[F=\frac{1}{k_{2}}(1+\frac{1}{k_{2}}-\frac{k_{1}}{k_{2}(1-k_{1})}) \tag{11}\]

doing some trivial simplifications. Now the subindex i is refered to the value of the repartition. As we can see in expression 11, the noise factor depends slightly of the last values of the repartition, in particular the contribution of \(k_{3}\) can be removed.

Figure 7: Pulsed Mode Amplification at Nominal Voltage and correction by the noise factor

The values of \(k_{1}\) and \(k_{2}\) can be obtained from the nominal voltage, \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) results from the gain in DC measurements.

**Example of PMT 8C06C14**

From the gain measured in DC mode, the values of \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) and the nominal voltage are known (\(G=\alpha V^{\beta}\)).

\(\alpha=1.046E-15\)

\(\beta=7.1\)

\(V_{nominal}=652\) volts

Taking in to account that the gain in one dynode is given by \(k_{1}=\alpha_{1}v_{1}^{\beta_{1}}\), with \(v_{i}=\frac{iV}{15}\) from the repartition, and the total gain can be expressed as \(G=k_{2}^{2}k_{1}^{4}k_{2}k_{3}\), the following values can be extracted :

\(\alpha_{1}=0.117768\)

\(\beta_{1}=0.8875\)

\(k_{1}=3.3488\)

\(k_{2}=6.1952\)

So finally the noise factor for this photomultiplier will be \(F=0.117768\).

## 5. Dark Current

The lower limit of light detection for a photomultiplier tube is determined by the electrical noise associated with the anode dark current. In TILECAL, the requirement for dark current is less than 1 nA at nominal voltage, and it has been supported for all the Hamamatsu generation of photomultipliers.

The dark current measurements are made after a warming up of more than one hour of the PMTs and the standard dividers. Results are presented in figure 8.

## 6 Linearity

In ATLAS the PMTs must operate in a well-defined manner (linear) with light produced from small signals (muons) to high signals (large energy deposited in a single cell). The requirement is that the non-linearity of the tile calorimeter must be less than 2% for pulses of 15 ns and 50 mA of peak current in order to measure high energy jets with sufficient precision.

We did several measurements:

**A)**: pulsed light at 1kHz (10 PMTs)
**B)**: pulsed light at 1kHz plus 4 \(\mu\)A of DC light (5 PMTs)
**C)**: pulsed light at 1kHz plus 2 \(\mu\)A of DC light (5 PMTs)
**D)**: pulsed light at 100Hz (5 PMTs)
**E)**: pulsed light at 100Hz plus 2 \(\mu\)A of DC light (5 PMTs)

The pulse width was 20ns. We used ten attenuation filters in order to get the different points, reaching an anode current up to 120mA. Figures 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 show the linearity and deviation plots. The errors are due to the fit in points from 4 to 7 and to the calibration factors of the filters.

We can conclude from the study that the loss of linearity due to the superposition of DC light is not significative and the different frequencies of pulses have not effect on the linearity.

## 7. Conclusions

For the last generation of R5900 8 stages Hamamatchu PMTs we can conclude from the measurements:

* There is a clear improvement in the quantum efficiency. From 16% to 18.5%.
* Good nominal voltage except for a few PMTs. Big dispersion, effect that will be very important for ten thousand PMTs.
* Pulsed gain not equal than gain in DC mode. Same behavior than before.
* Photocathode Sensitivity threshold above 10v.
* Dark current inside the requirements.
* Linearity inside the requirements \(<1\%\) for pulses of 20ns and 40mA currents. Los s of linearity up.
