The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

This note presents the status of recent studies of modern Monte Carlo generator setups for the pair production of top quarks at the LHC. Samples at a center of mass energy of 8 or 13 TeV have been generated using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 and Sherpa 2.2 at next-to-leading order precision in QCD. The results are compared to unfolded ATLAS data. The effects of varying relevant parameters are also presented for Sherpa 2.2.

## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS Collaboration has previously documented its choice of Monte Carlo (MC) generator parameters and the testing of new MC setups in order to improve the description of top-quark kinematics [1; 2; 3; 4]. The aim of this note is to present new studies that investigate the impact of parameter variations in the Sherpa 2.2.1 generator [5], reported in Section 3, and matching scale variations for the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO[6] generator interfaced with Pythia8[7], reported in Section 4, using unfolded data at \(\sqrt{s}=8\TeV\) and \(13\TeV\). The Rivet analyses that correspond to the unfolded data distributions are introduced in Section 2, along with a description of the parameter variations that are studied here. The conclusions of this note are then summarised in Section 5.

## 2 Monte Carlo samples and analyses for \(t\bar{t}\) production

### MC Generator settings

Two sets of next-to-leading-order (NLO) Monte Carlo samples that provide predictions for top-quark pair production are analysed in this note: Sherpa 2.2.1[5] and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO[6] interfaced with Pythia8[7]. The setup using Powheg[8; 9] interfaced with Pythia8 using the A14 set of tunable parameters [10] and \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}=\)1.5 \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) was studied in [4] and was found to give a good description of the unfolded data. The Powheg+Pythia8 setup is presented here to provide a reference for comparison to the Sherpa and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 samples.

The Sherpa 2.2.1[5] setup, first introduced and compared to data in [4], is studied by varying key-parameters relevant for hard scattering, parton shower and the fragmentation of heavy flavour quarks. The MEPS@NLO setup [11] is used for Sherpa 2.2.1, interfaced with OpenLoops[12] to provide the loop integrals for NLO generation. The prescription is used to include up to one additional parton at NLO accuracy and four additional partons at LO accuracy. The central scale is defined as \(\mu^{2}\ =\ m_{\mathrm{top}}^{2}+0.5\times(p_{T,t}^{2}+p_{T,\bar{t}}^{2})\)1 and the CKKW matching scale of the additional emissions is set to be 30 GeV. The default Sherpa 2.2.1 parton shower is used for the nominal samples along with the default parton density function (PDF), NNPDF 3.0 NNLO[13]. The following parameters are considered:

Footnote 1: This functional form is set in Sherpa using: CORE_SCALE VAR{sqr(172.5)+0.5x(PPerp2(p[2])+PPerp2(p[3]))}.

* Matrix element matching scale (CKKW): the scale taken for the calculation for the overlap between jets from the matrix element and the parton shower. The value in the nominal sample is set to 30 GeV. Two samples with the matching scale set to either 20 or 50 GeV are studied.
* Resummation scale (QSF): the scale used for the resummation of soft gluon emissions. The QSF is varied by a factor of 0.5 and 2 with respect to the nominal sample.
* Parton shower recoil scheme (CSS_KIN_SCHEME==1): the default scheme (== 0) corresponds to using the recoil scheme proposed in [14], while the alternative one enables the original recoil strategy documented in [15].
* \(\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}\) scale factor in the initial state evolution (CSS_IS_AS_FAC): this value is set to 0.5 in the nominal sample and to 1.0 for the systematic variation. Setting the parameter to 1.0 might give better behaviour of the high (shower) jet multiplicity, with less jets produced in the parton shower.

* Heavy Baryon Enhancement parameter (HBE): in the nominal sample, the HBE value is set to 4 while in the systematic variation sample it is set to 1. This setting is tested to improve the modelling of \(b\)-quark and \(c\)-quark hadronisation.
* Factorisation and renormalisation scales ( \(\mu_{\mathrm{F}}\) and \(\mu_{\mathrm{R}}\)): the scale is equal to \(\mu\) for nominal samples, while in the systematic samples it is varied by a factor of 0.5 and 2, using internal weights of the Sherpa sample.

Predictions are compared to unfolded data where available. Comparisons between samples are also made in order to establish the performance in the cases where unfolded data distributions are not available.

For the Powheg+Pythia8 generator setup, the impact of variations of the amount of additional radiation is assessed using two samples with the following setup:

* The factorisation and renormalisation scales are coherently varied by a factor of 2.0, the \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) value stays at 1.5 \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) and the Var3c down variation from the A14 tune is used.
* The factorisation and renormalisation scales are coherently varied by a factor of 0.5, the \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) value is increased to 3.0 \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) and the Var3c up variation from the A14 tune is used.

The Var3c A14 tune variation [10] corresponds to the varying of \(\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}\), which impacts ISR in the A14 tune. It was shown in [2] that this variation covers the size of the other available A14 eigentune variations.

The inclusive \(t\bar{t}\) production using the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 setup, also studied in [4], is further scrutinized considering the new functional form of the shower starting scale \(\mu_{\mathrm{q}}\) introduced by the authors in MadGraph5_aMC@NLOv2.5.3. In all previous versions generated by ATLAS, \(\mu_{\mathrm{q}}=\sqrt{\hat{s}}\) was used, while the new version uses \(\mu_{\mathrm{q}}=H_{\mathrm{T}}/2\). Here \(H_{\mathrm{T}}\) is the scalar sum of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of all outgoing partons. Since the new version was not available at the time of the study, the sample with the new matching scale was produced using MadGraph5_aMC@NLOv2.5.1 and a file provided by the authors. The standalone setup was throughly validated against the official ATLAS sample as well as samples produced by the authors. The renormalisation and factorisation scale choice is the same as for the Sherpa and Powheg setup as well as the choice of the PDF (NNPDF3.0).

### Measurements of \(t\bar{t}\) production

Predictions of various MC generators are compared to ATLAS data. Unfolded distributions from 8 TeV and 13 TeV measurements are taken into account. Compared to previous studies based on 7 TeV data [1, 2, 3, 4], the 8 TeV and 13 TeV measurements have smaller total uncertainties and allow for a better comparison. Measurements are unfolded to stable particle level in a fiducial phase-space or to parton-level with no restrictions on the phase space. Particle-level objects are defined for simulated events in analogy to detector-level objects. Only stable final-state particles, i.e. particles with a mean lifetime \(\tau>300\) ps are considered. Parton level top quarks are taken at the point after the top quark has emitted any QCD radiation, but before it decays. The studies shown in this document have been performed with Rivet v.2.4.0 [16] and the analyses used are listed below.

* **Analysis A: Measurement of jet activity produced in top-quark events with an electron, a muon and two \(b\)-tagged jets in the final state in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV with the ATLAS detector (not yet published in Rivet) [17]**The cross-sections are measured at stable particle level as function of jet multiplicities and jet transverse momentum spectra. The events are selected in the dilepton channel, which is characterised by the presence of exactly one electron and one muon with opposite charge and at least two jets being identified to originate from a \(b\)-quark. Jets originating from \(b\)-quarks are defined using a \(B\)-hadron matching, requiring at least one \(B\)-hadron to be found within the jet using the ghost association technique [18, 19, 20]. The jets are reconstructed with the anti-\(k_{t}\) jet algorithm with a radius parameter \(R=0.4\)[21]. Only jets and leptons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) are considered in the analysis. The data used in this measurement were taken with the ATLAS experiment at \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\).
* **Analysis B: Measurements of top-quark pair differential cross-sections in the lepton+jets channel in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV using the ATLAS detector (not yet published in Rivet) [22]** The cross-sections are measured at stable particle level in the resolved topology. The observables are the transverse momentum and absolute rapidity of the hadronically decaying top quark as well as the the transverse momentum, absolute rapidity and invariant mass of the \(t\bar{t}\)-system. The events are selected in the lepton+jets channel, which is characterised by the presence of exactly one charged lepton (electron or muon), at least four jets with at least two jets being identified to originate from a \(b\)-quark using the same technique described in Analysis A. The jets are reconstructed with the anti-\(k_{t}\) jet algorithm with a radius parameter \(R=0.4\)[21]. Only jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) are considered in the analysis. The results are defined at stable particle level and are corrected for all detector effects, within a kinematic range closely matching the experimental acceptance. The data used in this measurement were taken with the ATLAS experiment at \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\).
* **Analysis C: Select \(t\bar{t}\) events in the lepton+jets channel (MC only)** \(t\bar{t}\) events with exactly one charged lepton (electron or muon) and at least four jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) are selected, using the same particle-level definitions as for Analyses A,B and D. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-\(k_{t}\) jet algorithm with a radius parameter \(R=0.4\). At least two of the jets have to be identified as \(b\)-jets. This rivet routine is used for the comparison of simulated events only.
* **Analysis D: Measurement of top-quark pair differential cross-sections in the lepton+jets channel in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=8\,\mathrm{TeV}\) using the ATLAS detector (particle-level analysis: ATLAS_2015_I1404878, parton-level analysis: not published in Rivet) [23]** The cross-sections are measured at stable particle level and at parton level as a function of the transverse momentum and absolute rapidity of the hadronically decaying top quark and as a function of the transverse momentum, absolute rapidity and invariant mass of the \(t\bar{t}\)-system. The events are selected in the lepton+jets channel, which is characterised by the presence of exactly one charged lepton (electron or muon), at least four jets with at least two jets being identified to originate from a \(b\)-quark using the same technique described in Analysis A. The jets are reconstructed with the anti-\(k_{t}\) jet algorithm with a radius parameter \(R=0.4\)[21]. Only jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) are considered in the analysis. The results are defined at stable particle and parton level and are corrected for all detector effects, within a kinematic range closely matched to the experimental acceptance. The data used in this measurement were taken with the ATLAS experiment at \(\sqrt{s}=8\,\mathrm{TeV}\).

## 3 Sherpa variation studies

### Shower-related parameter studies

The impact of the matrix element matching scale, resummation scale, parton shower recoil scheme, \(\alpha_{S}\) parameter and heavy baryon enhancement parameter is studied for Rivet Analyses A and B. One of the most sensitive observables is the jet multiplicity: Figure 1 shows the number of additional jets using ATLAS data unfolded to particle level in Analysis A. Differences below 10% with respect to the nominal samples are observed in all cases, with the exception of the CKKW scale sets at 50 GeV which differs by 20% in the last bin. In particular, the studied parameters are expected to impact mostly the parton shower hence events with very high jet multiplicity: this is shown in the MC-to-MC comparisons reported in Figure 2, where the number of jets with transverse momenta above 25 GeV (including those from top pairs in lepton+jets final state events) are depicted. Differences up to 10-15% are found for \(N_{jets}>7\).

In Figures 3-7, the impact of the parameter variations described in Section 2.1 are studied for other observables from Rivet Analyses A and B. The nominal setup gives a reasonable description of the data and minor improvements in the data/MC agreement are seen when parameters are changed. The largest impact on the \(t\bar{t}\)\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (Fig. 6) is observed for the variation of the CKKW matching scale. For the CSS_KIN shower recoil scheme and varied \(\alpha_{S}\), minimal differences are observed, for example in the distributions of the top \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the \(t\bar{t}\)\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) as shown in Fig. 5 (c) and 6 (c), respectively. The sample with the HBE parameter set to unity leads to higher transverse momenta for the leading jet (Fig. 3 (c)) and the top quark (Fig. 5 (c)). The variation of the QSF scale has in general little impact.

The fluctuations that can be observed in several distributions, for example in the third jet bin of Fig. 1, originate from single events with large negative weights.

The data are represented as closed (black) circles with their corresponding uncertainties. The yellow band in the lower panel shows the total experimental uncertainty on the data (statistical and systematic). The generator predictions are shown as coloured lines. The fluctuation in Figure (c) originates from events with large negative weights.

The data and generator predictions are presented the same way as in Fig. 1.

The data and generator predictions are presented the same way as in Fig. 1.

### Heavy Baryon Enhancement studies

Additional studies have been carried out to better understand the heavy flavour composition of the Sherpa 2.2.1 samples. Correct modelling of the heavy flavour production fractions is an important element to reproduce in MC samples the efficiencies of identifying jets from \(b\)-quarks and \(c\)-quarks (tagging). Charm tagging is especially sensitive to these fractions, due to the large differences in lifetimes and semileptonic branching fractions among the charm hadron species. This section presents studies of the production fractions for Pythia8, Herwig 7 and Sherpa 2.2.1. For the latter, the effect of varying the HBE is studied comparing the default (HBE=4), with a lower HBE factor (HBE=1). Top-pair production samples are employed. Generator results are compared to the world averaged experimental measurements, as compiled in [24] for bottom and [25] for charm hadrons. However, it is worth noting that current experimental uncertainties on the heavy flavour production fractions in hadronic collisions are large. Especially problematic are the baryon fractions, which exhibit a large dependence on the kinematics of the region studied. At large \(\eta\) and low \(p_{T}\), the bottom baryon fraction is observed to be large, while for central production at high \(p_{T}\), the fractions appear to converge to values consistent with those seen at LEP (see Fig. 4 of [24]).

Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 8 compare the predictions of the different generators. For bottom hadrons, Pythia8 (Herwig 7) produces baryon fractions smaller (larger) than the world average while Sherpa with HBE factors of 1 is close to the experimental data. On the other hand, Sherpa 2.2.1 with HBE equal to 4 is much higher than the world average, and in clear disagreement. For charm, both Pythia8 and Herwig 7 produce less baryon fraction than the world average. Again, Sherpa with HBE factors of 1 is close to the experimental data whilst Sherpa 2.2.1 HBE factor of 4 is again much larger than the world average.

In conclusion, the HBE factor set in the default Sherpa 2.2.1 is inconsistent with measured flavour production fractions and should be reduced. In a future tuning these flavour fractions should be included to constrain this setting.

Hadron production fragmentation for b-jets is also studied using top-quark pair production samples generated at 13 TeV centre-of-mass energy. The fragmentation function \(f(z)\) is defined as the ratio of the

where jets (hadrons) are required to have transverse momentum above 25 (5) GeV, and the radial distance between jet and hadron must be below 0.3.

Since the \(B\) baryons have have slightly different fragmentation from the leptons, the shape of \(f(z)\) averaged over all species does depend slightly on HBE, as shown in Figure 9.

### Renormalization and factorization scales variation studies

For the Powheg+Pythia8 generator setup, the impact of variations on the amount of additional radiation is assessed using the parameter variations described in Section 2.1.

In Figures 10-13, the impact of the scale variations in Sherpa (left) are compared with the Powhegvariations (right) described above. For the jet multiplicity distributions in Fig. 10(a) and (b) and the transverse momentum of the leading jet (c) and (d), both setups show a similar variation, with the Sherpa scale variations having a slightly larger impact on the jet multiplicity and the Powheg setup showing larger variations on the jet momentum. To make the size of the variation more visible, a MC only comparison is displayed for the jet multiplicity distribution in the lepton+jets channel (Analysis C) in Fig. 11. Here the variations are of similar size for the two generator setups, with Powheg having larger variations in the last jet bin. The impact of the additional radiation on the top \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is small (Fig. 12 (a,b)) while a large effect is observed for the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the reconstructed \(t\bar{t}\) system (Fig. 12 (c,d)). For both setups, the impact on the \(t\bar{t}\)\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is larger than the uncertainty on the measurement for large transverse momenta. Finally in Fig. 13 the invariant mass of the \(t\bar{t}\) system is displayed, where the Sherpa and Powheg variations show a similar sensitivity. The statistical fluctuation observed in Fig. 13 originates again from single events with large negative weights.

Overall, a larger impact from the factorisation and hadronisation scale variations is observed for Sherpa than for the Powheg setup. It should be noted, however, that the uncertainties reported here do not include uncertainties due to scale variations in the parton shower. A consistent variation of the scales in the ME and PS is now possible in the Sherpa generator [26] and these should be included for both generators before final conclusions are reached.

Figure 10: The impact of factorisation and renormalisation scale variations for the Sherpa sample (left) and the radiation systematics for the Powheg+Pythia8 generator are compared to data at \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\). The comparison is performed for the number of additional jets (top) and the transverse momentum of the leading jet (bottom), using ATLAS data unfolded to particle level in Analysis A[17]. The data and generator predictions are presented the same way as in Fig. 1. The expression \(h_{\mathrm{d}}\) describes the \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) parameter.

The data and generator predictions are presented the same way as in Fig. 1. The fluctuations in Figures (a) and (c) originate from events with large negative weights. The expression \(h_{\mathrm{d}}\) describes the \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) parameter.

The expression \(h_{\mathrm{d}}\) describes the \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) parameter.

## 4 Mg5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 studies

In Figures 14 and 15, the agreement of the nominal Powheg+Pythia8 setup and of the two MadGraph5_aMC@NLO setups with data is studied. While the Powheg+Pythia8 setup describes the data quite well within the uncertainties, none of the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO setups gives a good description. For the jet multiplicity distribution in Fig. 14 (a), the sample with the \(H_{\mathrm{T}}\) shower starting scale (green) gives a slight improvement with respect to data. The comparisons for the leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (Fig. 14 (b)) and the \(t\bar{t}\)\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (Fig. 15 (b)) show large discrepancies between MC predictions and data. Furthermore, a high sensitivity of the invariant mass of the \(t\bar{t}\) system to the choice of the shower starting scale is observed, as shown in Fig. 15 (c). The same behaviour of the particle level distributions is confirmed using unfolded data for \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV, shown in Fig. 16 (a) and (c). As expected, at parton level no dependence of the invariant mass of the \(t\bar{t}\) system (Fig. 16 (b)) is observed, while for the \(t\bar{t}\)\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) differences are seen (Fig. 16 (d)).

Figure 14: The MadGraph5_aMC@NLO setups with different shower starting scales are compared to the Powheg+Pythia8 setup and to data at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV. The comparison is performed for (a) the number of additional jets, (b) the transverse momentum of the leading jet and (c) the transverse momentum of the leading \(b\)-jet, using ATLAS data unfolded to particle level in Analysis A[17]. The data and generator predictions are presented the same way as in Fig. 1. The expression \(h_{\mathrm{d}}\) describes the \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) parameter.

The data and generator predictions are presented the same way as in Fig. 1. The expression \(h_{\rm d}\) describes the \(h_{\rm damp}\) parameter.

The data and generator predictions are presented the same way as in Fig. 1. The expression \(h_{\rm d}\) describes the \(h_{\rm damp}\) parameter.

## 5 Conclusion

The Monte Carlo simulation of top-quark pair production has been studied for the Sherpa 2.2.1 and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 generators. Both setups are compared to the Powheg generator interfaced to Pythia8, which was established in [4]. Using unfolded data from ATLAS analyses at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV, the impact of several Sherpa parameters was studied. The impact of renormalization and factorization scale variations is found to be within the measurement uncertainties. An alternate recoil scheme is seen to have negligible impact on the predictions, while slightly better agreement with data is found for samples where the \(\alpha_{S}\) scale factor is increased. For the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 setup, the functional form of the matching scale was varied. Although some improvements were observed for example for the jet multiplicity distribution, other observables like the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the invariant mass of the \(t\bar{t}\) system were found to be not well modelled.
