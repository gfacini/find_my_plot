At a high energy, high luminosity hadron collider a detector's forward calorimeter absorbs a large fraction of the energy of particles produced in ordinary collisions. This energy heats the calorimeter. Cryogenic noble liquid sampling calorimeters must not have large temperature variations within the volume. Assuming heat is removed only on the outer periphery we calculate the temperature difference between the hottest and coolest parts of a forward calorimeter under the most extreme conditions. These temperature differences are found to be below one degree Kelvin and are entirely acceptable.

**INTRODUCTION**

We consider here the question of heat production and removal in a cryogenic noble liquid sampling calorimeter\({}^{1}\) at a high energy, high luminosity hadron collider such as the LBC or SSC. The source of the heat considered here is from showers initiated by particles generated by minimum bias collisions at the intersection point. Not only is heat generated directly from dE/dx energy losses of the shower particles through ionization in the material of the calorimeter but also from Ohmic heating due to the flow of charge in the active medium of the calorimeter, the noble liquid. Whereas this latter source is larger than the former in most sampling calorimeters, it is negligible in an optimal forward calorimeter.

While more energy is emitted in hadronic showers than in electromagnetic showers, the electromagnetic showers are denser so that the heat is deposited more locally. So we consider heat generated in electromagnetic showers. We assume that the heat is removed at the outer periphery of the forward calorimeter and is therefore maintained at a constant temperature. The inner realms of the calorimeter near the beam pipe and near electromagnetic shower maximum will be heated to the highest temperatures. The temperature difference between the freezing and boiling points of liquid argon is about 7.3 K at 1.5 atmosphere. The temperature difference between the hottest and coolest regions of the calorimeter must be much lower than this. The calculations show that this temperature difference is of order 0.6 K under the most extreme conditions. So heat removal is not a problem.

\(\bar{p}_{T}\) were constant over this full range, and we required all the energy of the event to be in this "rapidity plateau". (Of course in reality it is suspected that the "plateau" starts to fall off beyond \(|\eta|\sim 6\) but to continue well beyond \(\eta_{m}\).) The column labelled "Heat" is for reference only. It is the heat generated by all particles emitted from the IP in one hemisphere, i.e. in the range \(\eta>0\). Only non-interacting beam particles and elastic scattered particles are excluded.

**HEATING THE FORWARD CALORIMETER**

In this paper we will consider only the heating which is beam-related, i.e. we do not include heating due to electronics and heat leaks through the cryostat walls.

In ordinary noble liquid calorimeters it is not generally known that the largest source of beam-related heating is due to Ohmic heating from the drifting electrons and ions in the sensitive volume. We will show that this is not the case for the thin-gap calorimeter considered here.

For an incident photon of energy \(E_{0}\) on an idealized calorimeter such as in Figure 2 with a sensitive gap at EM shower maximum, the shower energy deposited in the gap per unit depth \(x\) of the gap measured in g/cm\({}^{2}\) is\({}^{3}\)

\[{dE_{S}\over dx}=0.1E_{0}K(e/\mu){dE_{S}\over dx}\rho_{S}\over{dE_{S}\over dx}X _{0}\]

where \(K(e/\mu)=0.9\) is the e/MIP response for a brass/LAr calorimeter, \(dE_{S}/dx=1.51\) MeV/g/cm\({}^{2}\) for the LAr, \(dE_{A}/dx=1.44\) MeV/g/cm\({}^{2}\) for the brass, \(\rho_{S}=1.4\) g/cm\({}^{3}\) is the density of LAr, and \(X_{0}=12.86\) g/cm\({}^{2}\) is a radiation length in brass. The rate of energy deposition per unit volume in this sensitive gap is\({}^{2,3,4}\)

\[P=\int_{\cal C}\sigma{1\over 2\pi}{dN_{0}\over d\eta}{1\over r_{\perp}^{2}}0. {1\over\sin\theta}K(e/\mu){dE_{S}\over dx}\rho_{S}\over{dE_{A}\over dx}X_{0}\]

where \(dN_{0}/d\eta=dN_{\rm ch}/d\eta\), \(\bar{p}_{T}|_{0}=\bar{p}_{T}|_{\rm ch}/2\), \(r_{\perp}\) is the distance from the beam line to a chosen location in the forward calorimeter at EM shower maximum, and \(\sin\theta\) is the angle which this location makes with the beamline at the IP. The ionization rate per unit volume is then\({}^{3}\)

\[D={1\over W}\int_{\cal C}\sigma{1\over 2\pi}{dN_{0}\over d\eta}{1\over r_{ \perp}^{2}}0.{1\over\sin\theta}K(e/\mu){dE_{S}\over dx}\rho_{S}\over{dE_{A} \over dx}X_{0}}\]

where \(W\) is the "ionization potential" for liquid argon, \(W=25\) eV. The current density due to this ionization is \(J=eaD\). As these charges, i.e. electrons and ions, move through the potential, \(V\), across the gap they generate Ohmic heat throughout the gap of density \(\bar{H}_{\rm Ohm}=J(V/a)=eDV\). We will parameterize this generation of heat density as

\[\bar{H}_{\rm Ohm}={A_{\rm Ohm}\over r_{\perp}^{2}\sin\theta}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

that the heating at EM shower maximum is also the heating at all other depths in the brass EM section of the forward calorimeter. This simplifies the calculations since heat will flow only radially, not longitudinally (along the beam line). This assumption will clearly yield an upper limit.

**HEAT REMOVAL FROM THE FORWARD CALORIMETER**

For a noble liquid calorimeter in the forward region the ionization density is so large (and the positive ion mobility so low) that positive ions can build up in the gap and distort the electric field. This distortion can modify the signal. In order to minimize this problem the gaps must be smaller than a critical size. But small gaps in a conventional parallel-plate structure are hard to maintain at the required tolerance. Also the electrical signal is hard to route from the electrodes to the electronics without an unacceptable amount of inductance with a concomitant slowing of the signal rise-time. For these reasons a different electrode structure has been suggested.

The electrode structure in the proposed forward calorimeter is built of tubes and rods with an electric field between them. The gap between the rod and tube is maintained by a spiraled quartz fiber and is of order 0.25 mm. The ID of the tube is about 5 mm and the hexagonally arrayed electrodes are 7.5 mm center-to-center nearest neighbor spacing. The electrodes are parallel to the beamline and so are close to projective to the incident particles. Each rod inside its tube must cool itself by conduction of heat through the liquid argon of the sensitive gap. (We will neglect any heat transfer through the quartz fiber.) Table III lists the thermal conductivity of relevant materials. I couldn't find brasses at cryogenic temperatures but brasses at room temperature have coefficients about 1/4th of Copper and I will assume this remains true at liquid argon temperatures.

The temperature difference between the inner rod and the outer tube necessary to conduct the heat out of the electrode is dominated by the thermal conductivity of the liquid argon. For the hottest part of a forward calorimeter at the LHC which is at a distance from the IP of \(z=5\) m and closest to the beamline at \(r_{\perp}=73\) mm, the heat due to dE/dx losses is \(H_{\rm dE/dx}=4.5\times 10^{-6}\) watts/mm\({}^{3}\). The temperature difference between the rod and tube is

\[\Delta T=\frac{a}{2\pi R}\frac{1}{k}H_{\rm dE/dx}\pi R^{2}=\frac{a}{2k}H_{\rm dE/dx }R\]

where k is the thermal conductivity of liquid argon and R is the radius of the tube. Using the numbers given above we get \(\Delta T=11\) mK. So the hottest rods will have a temperature 11 mK above the tubes. Electrodes further from the beam line will have smaller temperature differences between rod and tube.

For an LHC forward calorimeter at \(z=5\) m from the IP the dE/dx heating at EM shower maximum due to incident photons and hadrons is given by

\[H_{\rm dE/dx}(r_{\perp})=\frac{3zA_{\rm dE/dx}}{2r_{\perp}^{3}}=\frac{1.7\ {\rm watts}}{r_{\perp}^{3}}\]

We will use \(r_{i}=7.3\) cm for the inner radius of the EM forward calorimeter and \(r_{o}=54\) cm for the outer radius. The total heat \(Q\) generated between \(r_{i}\) and \(r_{\perp}\) (\(r_{i}<r_{\perp}<r_{o}\)) for a length \(L\) of calorimeter is

\[Q(r_{\perp})=L\int_{o}^{2\pi}d\phi\int_{r_{i}}^{r_{\perp}}H_{\rm dE/dx}(r)rdr= 3\pi zA_{\rm dE/dx}L\int_{r_{i}}^{r_{\perp}}\frac{dr}{r^{2}}=3\pi zA_{\rm dE/dx }L\Bigl{(}\frac{1}{r_{i}}-\frac{1}{r_{\perp}}\Bigr{)}\]

The heat flow density \(J\) at the cylindrical surface at \(r_{\perp}\) is given by \(2\pi r_{\perp}LJ(r_{\perp})=Q(r_{\perp})\) or

\[J(r_{\perp})=\frac{Q(r_{\perp})}{2\pi r_{\perp}L}=\frac{3zA_{\rm dE/dx}}{2r_{ \perp}}\Bigl{(}\frac{1}{r_{i}}-\frac{1}{r_{\perp}}\Bigr{)};\ \ \ r_{\perp}>r_{i}\]

The temperature difference between \(r_{i}\) and \(r_{\perp}\) is

\[T(r_{\perp})-T(r_{i})=-\frac{1}{k}\int_{r_{i}}^{r_{\perp}}J(r)dr=-\frac{3zA_{ \rm dE/dx}}{2k_{\rm Brass}}\Bigl{[}\frac{1}{r_{i}}\ln\frac{r_{\perp}}{r_{i}}+ \frac{1}{r_{\perp}}-\frac{1}{r_{i}}\Bigr{]};\ \ \ r_{\perp}>r_{i}\]

This assumes that heat flows equally through all parts of the forward calorimeter. We pessimistically assume that heat flows only between electrodes, not through the electrodes, and we assume the distance between electrodes is 1/3rd of the whole area at a cylindrical surface at \(r_{\perp}\) (also conservative). These assumptions are effected by the substitution \(k_{\rm Brass}\to k_{\rm Brass}/3\). Then

\[T(r_{0})-T(r_{i})=\Delta T=-\frac{9zA_{\rm dE/dx}}{2k_{\rm Brass}}\Bigl{[} \frac{1}{r_{i}}\ln\frac{r_{0}}{r_{i}}+\frac{1}{r_{o}}-\frac{1}{r_{i}}\Bigr{]}= 0.6\ {\rm K}\]

This small temperature difference, estimated using conservative overestimates wherever a simplification allows for analytical calculation, suggests that boiling of liquid argon in the gaps of the forward calorimeter will not be a problem at the LHC even at the highest luminosities. Should more accurate calculations indicate the margin of safety is too small then there are several small design changes which should allow for large improvements. For instance there is only a small machining penalty for using Copper rather than brass for the absorber material. This would lead to a factor 4 reduction in the temperature difference \(\Delta T\). Cooling coils could be mounted to the front and/or rear faces of the FCal to remove heat from the ends as well as on the periphery.

1) Fractional energy deposition versus depth in radiation lengths for a brass calorimeter at \(\eta=5.0\). The mean energy of gammas, \(\bar{E}\), is \(\bar{p}_{T}/\sin\theta\) where \(\bar{p}_{T}=0.3\) GeV and \(\theta=0.0135\) radians. Two EM shower profiles are shown. One is for monochromatic photons at \(\bar{E}\) while the other is integrated over the spectrum of photons from \(\pi^{o}\) decay. The integral under each is unity. The hadronic shower profile is for monochromatic pions of energy \(2\bar{E}\) and therefore the integral under the curve (if extended to the end of the shower) is twice that for EM showers. In a brass calorimeter the density of energy deposition of hadronic showers per radiation length is larger than in heavier metals because the ratio of interaction length to radiation length is smaller. The longitudinal hadronic shower profile is unrealistic because the appreciable transverse spreading is not accounted for. This spreading depletes the high \(|\eta|\) region and enhances the low \(|\eta|\) region. This correction eases the heat removal problem.
