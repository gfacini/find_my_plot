**Abstract:**

We have measured the dimensions of 2.2 meter long aluminum tubes that were produced by the firm Menziken (Switzerland) for use in the construction of planes of monitored drift tubes (MDTs) for the precise measurement of muon trajectories through the ATLAS air-core toroids [1]. Of the 700 delivered tubes, all but 26 met the specified tolerances. Another 51 were rejected because of their unacceptably large curvature, a matter that was not directly specified in the original order.

**The Measurements:**

Dimensions of the tubes were specified by ATLAS to be within the following ranges of tolerance: diameter 30.000 mm + 0.000 mm and - 0.030 mm; wall thickness 0.400\(\pm\)0.020 mm; length 2200 mm. The short-wavelength oscilations were stipulated as \(<\) 0.030 mm per 300 mm. As mentioned above, the straightness criterion for the full tube was not specified directly, but was chosen _ap posteriori_ to be \(<\) 0.300 mm over the length of each tube. The departure of any tube's circumference from circularity was stipulated in terms of a maximal radial deviation of \(\pm\) 0.016 mm from a circle.

The aluminum tubes were cut by Menziken from longer extrusions to lengths of 2200 mm. According to the manufacturer, this procedure was not have any significant impact on the roundness of the final product, but, as we shall see, the cutting seems to have had a small but measurable effect on the eccentricities of the tubes near their cut ends. As the tubes were unpacked from their shipping containers (shipped 100 per crate), all were marked with a scribing tool with a consecutive serial number and the letter A at one end, and just with the letter B at the other.

We used two methods for measuring the outer diameters of tubes. One was the Sling Technique [2], wherein a tube was captured in a noose of thin tungsten fiber of fixed length. The fiber was attached to a fixed point on one side, looped over the circumference of the tube, and continued to a spring-loaded movable stand on the other side. Upon the slow tightening of the noose against the pressure of the spring, a reading could be taken of the position of the movable end. In this way, a fixed feeler gauge provided the precise location of the end of the wire and thereby determined the circumference of the tube. The method was calibrated using a steel precision cylinder with a diameter of 30 mm. The calibration was also checked using a cylinder with diameter 0.020 mm over that value. Measurements of the difference in circumference relative to the 30 mm standard were obtained at distances of about 30 mm from the end of each tube.

The second method (Ovality Technique) involved measuring the largest and smallest excursions in the diameter of the tube. This was done using a fixed feeler gauge, as the tube was rotated full circle, while resting on two small stands that were placed about 1.2 m apart. The feeler was positioned just above one of the stands, and the tube was supported at two points on bearings located at \(\pm 45^{0}\) relative to the vertical through the center of a 30 mm circle. The feeler gauge was located about 180\({}^{0}\) relative to one of these support points. Thus, we measured values close the exact minimum and maximum diameters, but slightly underestimated because of the ovality of the tube. The correction for this effect depends on the type of distortion of the tube (and somewhat on the tube curvature between support stands), but is very small, and has been neglected. (Of course, we could have circumvented this bias by using a more complex set of two feeler gauges, but decided that this was not necessary for the desired level of precision.) The procedure was calibrated relative to the 30 mm standard (that appeared round to a precision \(<\)1 \(\mu\)m). The method was also checked using a cylinder that was 20 \(\mu\)m oversized in its diameter. In this manner, the major and minor axes were measured at about 20 mm from either end (referred to as measurements A or B), as well as at the approximate middle (referred to as measurements M), of each tube. These measurements also provided the data for determining the ovality, or departure of the tube circumference from circular symmetry.

The lengths of the tubes were not considered very critical, and were therefore not checked. The flatness of each tube was characterized by squeezing 100, 200 and 300 \(\mu\)m foils into any visible gaps under the tubes as they were rolled on a flat granite table. The wall thickness of the tubes was checked on every tenth tube, using a micrometer that had markings every 10 \(\mu\)m,

**The Results:**

A total of 26 tubes arrived nickel or otherwise damaged (most had small dents that might have been sustained during packing or shipment). These were clearly out of tolerance, but were retained for measuring with the rest of the sample. Except for the visible dents, these tubes appeared to be similar in quality to the others in the sample.

The tube thickness variations were found to be well within tolerance. All but two of the readings gave 0.400 mm. One tube indicated a thickness of 0.390 mm, and another was about 0.395 mm thick.

The measurements of the tube diameters using the Sling Method were limited, to some extent, by the dexterity of the operator. Initial measurements were not as reproducible as those taken after gaining some experience with the procedure.

return subsequently to this minor point.) The results analogous to Fig. 2, but for the measurements at the middle of the tubes, are shown in Fig. 3. The results for the diameters in the middle and at the ends are close to consistency, but the small (0.55 \(\mu\)m) difference between the means may reflect the fact that the Ovality Method tends to underestimate diameters of tubes with large eccentricity, which is the case at the ends. Nevertheless, the departures from circularity are all within tolerance in the middle, and only a few tubes are out of spec at the ends.

To gauge the uncertainty on these measurements, we show, repectively in Figs. 2(c) and 3(c), the difference in the mean diameters obtained from the two values at the ends of each tube, and the difference obtained using one end value and the value in the middle. We see that the dispersions in these differences are similar to those in Fig. 1, indicating that the methods have comparable reproducibility. However, we can also see that the results for longer separations do not appear to be as precise as for shorter distances. In fact, this may just reflect the presence of larger variations in tube diameters over longer lengths. However, we must also attribute this difference partly to the curvature of tubes, which can affect the Ovality measurement but not that using the Sling Method. Ignoring any possible variations in tube diameter, we see from Fig. 3(c) that the reproducibility of a measurement using the Ovality Method is at least as good as about 1.4 \(\mu\)m.

Figure 4 displays a comparison between the measurements for the two methods. In (a) we show the distribution in the mean undersize in the diameter for the Ovality Technique, and in (b) the analogous result for the Sling Method. The difference between the two sets of means is given in (c). The dependence of this difference on tube number is shown in Fig. 5, and continues in Fig. 6. We see that the discrepancy between the two sets of values jumps in small steps that we believe to correspond to the resetting of zeros for the standard cylinder in the Sling Method. Clearly, the discrepancy would have been smaller had we corrected the Sling measurements for the 2 \(\mu\)m shift we mentioned above.

Finally, in Fig. 7, and continued in Figs 8 and 9, we display the maximum and minimum diameters as a function of tube number, for the two ends and for middle of the tube. As expected, large excursions in the maximum are associated with comparable diminutions in the minimum values of the diameter. There is not much correlation between ends, nor between the middle and the ends. This suggests that the larger (but still acceptably small) eccentricities are produced in the cutting procedure. The excursions in the B-end of the tubes for tube numbers 500-600 are particularly large, and we can attribute these only to the order in which the tubes arrived from Menziken.

**Conclusions:**

Using two different techniques to measure the diameters of 700 Menziken tubes, we observe that the dispersion in tube diameters is within the tolerance given by ATLAS. The mean value of the tube diameter is about 10 \(\mu\)m on the small side. This should not cause any difficulty in fitting the tubes onto the Figure 3: The distribution in the undersize of diameters at the middle of the 700 tubes, using the Ovality Method, is given in (a). In (b) we show half the difference between the maximum and minimum radial measurements obtained at the middle of each tube. In (c) we have the difference between one of the end diameters and the middle diameter.

endplugs (in fact, our experience has shown that fitting tubes onto precision-turned endplugs makes them more circular), and we consequently consider the tubes acceptable from that perspective. Except for possible shipping misshaps with 26 tubes, which arrived damaged and were deemed unacceptable, and the 51 tubes that had too great a curvature (a parameter that will have to be specified more clearly in the future), the tubes can be regarded as usable by ATLAS.
