**Abstract**

The high voltage distribution system of the ATLAS end-cap hadronic calorimeter is discussed here.

The aim is to understand and compare the performance of the calorimeter for the two possible distribution schemes, using resistor chains or high resistive coating. We discuss cross-talk, noise, and sensitivity to the large pile-up expected for the LHC experiments for both schemes.

We find no sizable differences in the expected performance for the two possible solutions. In addition we show that the use of four resistor values is appropriate for the resistor chain solution, and discuss different wiring schemes with respect to reliability.

Introduction

The high luminosity at LHC leads to a large number of interactions in each bunch crossing, thus leading to large ionization rates in the end-cap calorimeters. This will clearly result in sizable currents in the high voltage distribution systems of these calorimeters. As the currents due to pile-up depend strongly on the distance to the beam line, the corresponding voltage drop will lead to a variation of the signal per unit of deposited energy in the radial direction. This sets an upper limit to the resistor values suitable for the HV distribution systems. Lower limits on the resistor values arise from effects of capacitive and resistive cross-talk, resistor noise, and amplifier safety.

The scope of this note is to investigate the consequences of the above effects on the performance and electronics design of the high voltage distribution system of the ATLAS hadronic end-cap calorimeter. For part of our studies we restricted ourselves to the case of high voltage distribution through resistor chains. The results found will be compared to those for high voltage distribution through high resistive coatings.

The wiring scheme

In all cases studied we have limited ourselves to the first longitudinal section of the front hadron compartment. We have assumed a wiring scheme that connects the electrodes radially. The inner 10 electrodes are connected by one resistor value, and the outer 10 electrodes are connected by another resistor value. This is shown schematically in Fig. 1. In parallel wiring schemes connecting all electrodes radially, with high voltage at both the inner and outer radius, has been considered. These wiring schemes have the advantage of a redundant supply of high voltage. In all cases we keep the induced voltage drop per unit of deposited energy the same in all liquid argon gaps of an EST. This is achieved by increasing the resistor values for the high voltage lines of the outer liquid argon gaps by a factor of two. All geometrical properties used are as described in the note on the mechanical design of the ATLAS hadronic end-cap calorimeter[1].

PSPICE modeling

### The PSPICE model

A PSPICE model of one entire calorimeter layer has been put together in a modular way. The PSPICE model of the readout is shown in Fig. 2. We included the input impedance of 50 \(\Omega\), a noise source, the gain and shaping response of the amplifier, and the shaping network. The model of the liquid argon cell (see Fig. 3) includes the capacitances of the EST structure, the resistors of the high voltage distribution system, and the cross-capacitances between adjacent calorimeter cells. A model of a calorimeter layer is obtained by grouping 20 of these cells as shown in Fig. 4. Here the cross-capacitances in between pad 10 and pad 11 have been taken into account explicitly. The cross-capacitances were set to zero for pad number one and 20.

### Cross-talk

In order to estimate the cross-capacitances between two adjacent copper pads in the HV/return layers of adjacent cells, we used the following picture: We viewed the pads as two parallel strips of neglectable thickness at a close edge distance \(a=2\) mm and limited the integration region of the electric field to approximately three times the gap width (wide edge distance \(d=6\) mm) to account for shielding effects due to the pad at the opposite side of the liquid argon gap. We took shielding effects due to the copper pad at the opposite side of the Kapton-layer into account by applying a factor 0.5. This rough estimation results in [2]

\[C\ =\ \frac{\epsilon\epsilon_{0}}{2}\{K(1\ -\ a^{2}/d^{2})\}/\{K(a/d)\}\ \approx\ 0.13\mbox{pF}/\mbox{cm}. \tag{1}\]

Here \(C\) is the capacitance per unit of length, \(\epsilon\epsilon_{0}\) is the dielectricity constant in liquid argon, and \(K\) is the complete elliptical integral. The resulting values are shown in Fig. 5 as a function of rapidity. A factor of two has been added in order to account for the cross-capacitance to the residual pads of the EST. The cross-capacitances in between two pads of the readout layers have been neglected, since they are shielded to a large extent by the adjacent copper pads of the HV lines.

The stability of the results with regard to variations in the assumption on close and wide edge distance has been investigated. In addition the result has been verified by numerically integrating Maxwell's equations with the boundary conditions given by the EST-geometry. The cross-check was based on work done by D. Axen [3]. We estimate a systematic uncertainty of the cross-capacitance values of about 30%.

Figure 6 shows the total cross-talk for various values of the HV resistors as obtained from PSPICE simulation. The results shown are the worst case. When going to low values of rapidity, the capacitive cross-talk drops slowly by approximately a factor of two. We find that for resistances greater than 130 k\(\Omega\) the capacitive cross-talk dominates. This puts a first lower bound to the value of the resistors in the high voltage distribution system.

### Noise

The use of resistors in distributing the HV will lead to an increase of the total noise at the shaper output. This effect has been investigated with PSPICE simulation assuming a white noise source. The total noise integral at the shaper output is shown in Fig. 7 for various values of HV resistors as a function of the frequency. We find that there is no significant increase of noise due to the resistors of the HV distribution system for resistor values above 90 k\(\Omega\). This puts a second lower bound to the value of the resistors in the HV distribution system.

### Comparison to high resistive coatings

Since noise as well as cross-talk studies with high resistive coatings are not available for EST set-ups, we did a PSPICE simulation of this situation. Our model of the electronic properties of high resistive coating is based on the concept used by W. Flauger [4] to study cross-talk for the H1 liquid argon calorimeter. It is shown schematically in Fig. 8. We represent a square of high resistive coating of resistivity R by n strips of resistivity R/n, and couple the individual strips of different layers with capacitances corresponding to the strip-size to form the EST-structure. We included the cross-capacitance in between the copper pads of the readout board explicitly. For practical reasons we neglected the capacitances in the 2 mm wide strip that separates two adjacent cells and represented this strip by one single resistor \(R_{s}\).

The systematic error introduced by the finite number of strips per square has been checked as follows: Using the model Fig. 8 will overestimate the cross-talk, since for any signal current generated in one of the capacitances, the resistivity of the corresponding strip is neglected. If, on the contrary, we neglect the capacitance of the first strip at the cell boundary by removing that capacitor in the model, we are sure to underestimate the cross-talk. For high numbers of strips per square, the difference will be small and both models will have a common asymptotic result. Figure 9 shows the cross-talk obtained from both models as a function of the number of strips per square. All the following investigations were carried out assuming 200 strips per square. In this case, the systematic uncertainty of the method is smaller than 15%.

The results of the simulations of cross-talk and noise are shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 respectively. We investigated various values of specific resistivity. In conclusion resistive noise is neglectable for all resistivities under discussion, that is all resistivities of the order of 1 M\(\Omega\)/\(\raisebox{-0.86pt}{\hbox{\rule{0.4pt}{6.5pt}\rule{6.5pt}{0.4pt}\rule[6.5 pt]{6.5pt}{0.4pt}}\rule[6.5pt]{0.4pt}{0.4pt}\rule{0.4pt}{6.5pt}}\) and above.

The cross-capacitance for high resistive coating is smaller by a factor of three compared to that for resistor chains. However, in contrast to the resistor chain solution, resistive cross-talk is visible for high resistive coatings with the proposed resistances. The simulation result for total cross-talk is smaller by approximately 30%, depending on the actual value of the cross capacitance.

Decrease of signal due to reduction of high voltage

A reduction of the high voltage across the liquid argon gap will reduce the electron drift velocity, and will increase charge recombination at electro-negative impurities. Both effects will result in a reduction of the signal per unit of energy. It is well known that such a reduction of voltage, and the corresponding variation of the calorimeter response as a function of the radius \(r\) is induced by the dc-part of the currents due to pile-up events.

### Currents in the high voltage distribution system

The currents in the high voltage distribution system due to pile-up, \(j\), have been calculated from simulated data [5] of pile-up events in the region of the hadronic end-cap at discrete values of rapidity according to

\[j\ =\ E\cdot\frac{e}{I_{i\,on}}\cdot\frac{1}{N_{EST}N_{g\,up}}\cdot\frac{1}{t_ {\,bx}}\cdot f_{\,ssm}.\]

Here \(E\) is the total energy in a readout tower, \(e\) is the electron charge, \(I_{i\,on}\) is the effective ionization potential of liquid argon (23.6 eV), \(N_{EST}\) is the number of cells per tower (8), \(N_{g\,ap}\) is the number of liquid argon gaps per cell (4), \(t_{\,bx}\) is the time between two consecutive bunch crossings (25 ns), and \(f_{\,ssm}\) is the sampling ratio (\(\approx\frac{1}{26}\)) of the calorimeter.

We did a cubic interpolation of these currents as a function of rapidity. The quality of the result is illustrated in Fig. 12. For values of rapidity below the lowest available data point we assumed a constant level of pile-up background. For very high values of rapidity we extrapolated the cubic behavior, thus using conservative assumptions at both the low and high rapidity limits.

### Change of electron drift velocity

The dependence of the drift velocity \(v_{d}\) of electrons in liquid argon on the applied electrical field \(E\) is known from experiment (See ref. [6], and others cited there). Predictions from theory are available as well. The basic work has been done by M. Morse et al. [7]. This was improved and applied for liquid argon by J. Lekner [8]. The agreement with experiment is at the 15% level in the region of interest. The drift velocity of electrons in liquid argon is found to be in good approximation proportional to \(E^{1/3}\). We used the following parametrization:

\[v_{d}\ =\ 3.7(E[\frac{\mathrm{kV}}{\mathrm{mm}}])^{\frac{1}{3}}\frac{\mu\mathrm{m} }{\mathrm{ns}}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

change in mean free path contributes only about 10% to the total effect, but shows a significantly stronger dependence on the applied high voltage.

Using the values of the currents due to pile-up events, the maximum signal reduction compared to nominal voltage can be shown as a function of the resistor values in the resistor chains. This is done in Fig. 14. Note that for the inner liquid argon gaps of an EST there are resistors in both the high voltage and the return lines of the high voltage distribution system. The build up of voltage in the return line equals the voltage drop in the high voltage line. The voltage reduction across the liquid argon gap is larger by a factor of two in these gaps.

We find that, in order to keep the signal change at least a factor of two below 0.2% for the nominal voltage \(U=2\) kV, the resistor values in the resistor chains should be not larger than

* 4.0 M\(\Omega\) for the outer liquid argon gaps at the tiles at small values of rapidity,
* 1.0 M\(\Omega\) for the outer liquid argon gaps at the tiles at large values of rapidity,
* 2.0 M\(\Omega\) for the inner liquid argon gaps at the tiles at small values of rapidity,
* 0.5 M\(\Omega\) for the outer liquid argon gaps at the tiles at large values of rapidity.

We performed similar studies for the wiring scheme connecting all tiles of a layer by one resistor value. For this wiring scheme the 0.2% limit in signal change leads us to the following resistor values:

* 2.0 M\(\Omega\) for the outer liquid argon gaps at all tiles.
* 1.0 M\(\Omega\) for the inner liquid argon gaps at all tiles.

Assuming a factor of four in between the resistor values for tiles at low and high rapidity, but connecting all tiles leads to the following values:

* 5.0 M\(\Omega\) for the outer liquid argon gaps at the tiles at small values of rapidity,
* 1.2 M\(\Omega\) for the outer liquid argon gaps at the tiles at large values of rapidity,
* 2.5 M\(\Omega\) for the inner liquid argon gaps at the tiles at small values of rapidity,
* 0.6 M\(\Omega\) for the outer liquid argon gaps at the tiles at large values of rapidity.

Any scheme that connects all tiles is superior to the others with respect to sensitivity to single resistor failure. The high voltage distribution will be interrupted only in the case of a double resistor failure in one resistor chain. The probability for double resistor failure in one single resistor chain can be calculated from the rate of single resistor failure. Building the modules for the test-run scheduled for Sept. 1995 will constitute a test of this failure probability. In case no resistor failure occurs, the probability for one single double resistor failure in all of both end-caps will be smaller than 8%.

### Comparison to high resistive coating

The effect of reduction of drift velocity on the signal has been investigated by M.S. Levitsky and A.A. Minaenko in some detail [12]. After adjusting their results to the geometry and high voltages currently under discussion, we find a maximum signal change of 0.56% for a resistivity of 1 \(\,\mathrm{M\Omega}/\raisebox{-3.01pt}{\hbox{\rule{0.4pt}{6.5pt}\rule{6.5pt}{0. 0pt}\rule[6.5pt]{6.5pt}{0.0pt}}\rule[6.5pt]{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}\). For resistor chains the maximum signal change due to both above effects was 0.2% for 1 \(\,\mathrm{M\Omega}\) resistors.

Conclusions

The calculations that lead to the upper bounds on the resistor values suitable for the HV distribution system were based on very conservative assumptions. Thus, for use with resistor chains, we recommend the following resistor values in the return and high voltage lines of the high voltage distribution system of the ATLAS end-cap hadronic calorimeter:

* For the outer liquid argon gaps at the 10 tiles at small values of rapidity: 4.0 M\(\Omega\).
* For the outer liquid argon gaps at the 11 tiles at large values of rapidity: 1.0 M\(\Omega\).
* For the inner liquid argon gaps at the 10 tiles at small values of rapidity: 2.0 M\(\Omega\).
* For the inner liquid argon gaps at the 11 tiles at large values of rapidity: 0.5 M\(\Omega\).

We also recommend the use of the wiring scheme that connects all tiles of a layer radially.

Taking into account the effects investigated, resistor chains and high resistive coatings appear to lead to rather similar performances. When using resistor chains, the effect of currents due to pile-up events will be smaller. High resistive coatings have the advantage of slightly lower cross-talk. The effect of currents due to pile-up events is not local and can in principle be corrected for, as long as the actual resistance in the high voltage distribution system is well known. The differences in cross-talk are rather small. We tend to not give preference to any of the proposed solutions without taking into account technical aspects. We recommend to cross-check the cross-talk issue by actual measurement, and recommend to take reliability, cost, amplifier safety, ease in manufacturing and assembly, etc. into account prior to the final decision.
