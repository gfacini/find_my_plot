HYTEC-TN-UCSC-01 November 22, 1994 provided a functional dependence of heating with temperature expressed directly in \({}^{\circ}\)C. This expressic\({}_{\Box}\) is as follows:

\[\rm q^{=}q_{0}exp(\alpha T)\] Eq. ( 2 )

The heat flux at \({}^{0}\)C is \(\rm q_{0}\). Heat flux increases exponentially with \(\alpha T\), where \(\alpha\) was determined to be 1/11. This expression besides being simpler, offered encouragement to seeking a purely analytical solution. The progress made to date in this area will also be presented.

The initial value used for the internal heating was 600 milliwatts per module. This design value was set by C. Haber as being representative of two highly irradiated single sided detectors. As a matter of convenience this internal heating of the silicon was represented as a surface heat flux of 4.17 10\({}^{\circ}\) W/mm\({}^{2}\), per single sided strip detector. This initial heat flux value was treated as an independent parameter in our study. This method affords an opportunity to compare the thermal runaway heat flux to this reference point, principally to gain an appreciation of the design margin. If it is determined later that the radiation damaged detectors have a leakage current less than or greater than this value, one can adjust the margin cited herein quite simply.

### Detector Parameters

Conditions leading to thermal runaway in a silicon detector have specific characteristics that are related to the detector geometry and materials of construction. In most respects these parameters are intuitive, namely detector thickness, length, and the material thermal conductivity. To what extent each of these parameters contribute to the thermal runaway condition is not immediately clear, however. We suspected that the strongest dependence was connected to detector length. It will be shown that this parameter, i.e., the distance from the outer most detector edge to the point where the heat is removed, is a dominant factor. This distance can be equal to or less than one detector length, depending on the general arrangement of the detector and detector cooling system. In this study the adhesive bondlines that are used to construct the MCM's and joining of the cooling tubes have been omitted. This effect was modeled earlier[4], and it was judged for the purposes of this study not to have a measurable influence on establishing the thermal runaway condition.

The prior study[4] assessed the temperature gradients in three designs In-Line (INL) design by C. Haber of LBL, KEK module design by Nobu Unno, and the RAL design by R. Apsimon. The characteristic detector length (uncooled length) cited above differs significantly among these designs. To facilitate a review of the critical detector parameters associated with thermal runaway, we chose two of these designs for detailed study, the KEK module and the RAL design. The differences in the designs are quite distinctive, and we anticipated that these differences could be discerned in our study.

The KEK module design proposed by Nobu Unno, with some adjustments in the MCM arrangement taken by C. Haber is shown in Figure 1.

The KEK module is composed of two 60 mm long silicon wafers that are edge bonded in the middle. Exact construction details are not reflected in our modeling and consequently are not shown here. The cooling channel location would be placed to the right of the region denoted signal cable. Thus, the distance from the far left edge of the detector to the cooling channel is nominally 94 mm. This location is approximately 3/4 the distance from the far end of 120 mm long strip detector. The electronic chips are to be wire bonded to the strip detector at midspan. A possible arrangement for mounting this module to a circular cooling ring is shown in Figure 2, and 3.

Figure 2: KEK Module With End Plate Mounting Surfaces for attachment to a Ring Structure

In the preceding figures of the KEK module design we identify a diamond heat spreader. This element is not part of the standard KEK module design. This heat spreader is placed between the two single sided silicon wafers and serves to enhance the thermal conduction for the internal silicon heating. The benefits that one may derive from inserting a small amount of material placed longitudinally will be discussed shortly. The cooling ring support provides cooling on both the top and bottom surface of the detector module. Figure 3 shows the detector as it is placed in the ring. Cooling tubes, an upper and lower, follow the slight detector tilt required to satisfy the Lorentz angle. The purpose for posing a design arrangement as seen above was to ensure we had proportioned the detector in a realistic manner. Other options come to mind that bear study. A case in mind would be basically the same module configuration, but mounted to the barrel stave concept typified by the RAL ATLAS design. This candidate arrangement is shown in Figure 4.

A plan view that illustrates the KEK module and proposed diamond heat spreader to facilitate removal of the surface heat flux is shown in Figure 5. A 1 mm dead air space is used to thermally isolate the thermal load of the electronic chips from the detector wafer. The need for this gap was established in the previous study[4].

The heat spreader, outlined as a dashed area, serves as a primary substrate to support the module onto the stave. The diamond substrate is 300 microns thick, and is sandwiched between the two single-sided detector wafers. The thermal conductivity of this material is nearly 10 times that of silicon and, for a rather small mass penalty, serves to effectively enhance heat removal from the large detector surface. This feature is not unlike the arrangement characteristic of the RAL module design. It would appear that the above arrangement may offer some reduction in overall radiation length. This observation would require further inspection before a hard conclusion could be drawn.

Figure 5: Plan View of KEK Module with Diamond Heat Spreader

The RAL module design is shown in Figure 6. The electronic chips are mounted on the alumina hybrid directly over the barrel stave that runs parallel with the silicon strip detector, at a total of six places. This close coupling of the electronic chips to the barrel stave, which carries the coolant, serves to remove heat from the module quite effectively. This arrangement also reduces the distance that heat generated in the silicon must be conducted before reaching the 0\({}^{\circ}\)C cooled surface.

Hopefully, a brief description of each detector served to highlight the parameters we intuitively chose to attack in solving the thermal runaway issue. We first proceeded with finite element computational methods where we varied the heat flux according to the simplified temperature dependent expression discussed earlier. We supplemented this approach with an analytical approach.

### Thermal Runaway Studies

### FEA Results for Silicon Wafers

Figure 7 illustrates the FEA results for a 94 mm silicon wafer. These computational solutions are set-up and run as successive steady state solutions. For both conditions shown, the detector has a fixed temperature of 0\({}^{\circ}\)C at one edge. This boundary condition simulates the KEK detector geometry without the electronic heat load. Two conditions of heat flux were simulated, a constant and variable. The variable flux assumed a temperature dependence according to exp(\(\alpha\)T).

As shown the detector peak edge temperature varies linearly with the constant surface heat flux, whereas for the temperature dependent solution T varies exponentially with

Figure 6: RAL Module Design with Beryllia Hybrids Shown

heat flux. Also for this solution a critical heat flux is encountered. At this critical heat flux, the FEA steady solution no longer converges. The temperature dependent heat flux makes the problem nonlinear. This can be shown as follows:

**Constant heat flux**

D\({}^{2}\)T/Dx\({}^{2}\)=-q\({}_{0}\)/kt where k equals the thermal conductivity for silicon and t is the wafer thickness; q\({}_{0}\) is the constant surface heat flux for the linear solution. We can solve this second order differential and obtain the following relationship for the maximum edge temperature:

T\({}_{\text{max}}\)=(q\({}_{0}\)L\({}^{2}\)/2kt)1

Footnote 1: T=(q/2kt)(L\({}^{2}\)-x\({}^{2}\)), where for x equal to 0, T=Tmax. At this boundary the thermal gradient equals 0.

\(\tau\)

The temperature varies parabolically from T\({}_{\text{max}}\) to 0\({}^{\circ}\)C at the cooled end. We find that our FEA solution agrees with this relationship with a high degree of precision. One will note that the peak temperature, T\({}_{\text{max}}\) varies as the square of the distance from the cooled end.

For results shown we chose k equal to 0.15 W/m-K, and 0.3 mm for the wafer thickness This particular value of thermal conductivity was obtained from engineering prototype tests on the SDC silicon module at Los Alamos National Laboratory [4]. The prototypes were constructed from high purity silicon wafers. It is possible to find published values for silicon thermal conductivity below this value, as well as higher. The variation in thermal conductivity has been attributed to silicon purity.

**Temperature Dependent Heat Flux**

With the addition of the temperature dependence we have for the nonlinear differential equation:

D\({}^{2}\)T/Dx\({}^{2}\)=-(q\({}_{0}\)/kt)exp(\(\alpha\)T) Eq. (3)

This deceptively simple relationship has yet to be solved explicitly for T. Some progress has been made in characterizing the effect of adding the temperature dependence, and this progress will be discussed shortly.

Figure 8 is an FEA of a shorter silicon wafer. Again, we encountered the thermal runaway condition, but at a higher initial q\({}_{0}\) surface heat flux value. The heat flux at runaway for the 60 mm module was 12.05432 10\({}^{-5}\) whereas for the 94 mm wafer we predicted 4.91125 10\({}^{-5}\) W/mm\({}^{2}\). Bear in mind to obtain these particular values we had to run numerous solutions to obtain convergence at conditions just at the threshold of thermal runaway. One will find that a ratio of these heat fluxes is 2.45443. Not too surprising we get a factor of 2.4544 for a detector length square term, i.e., the critical heat flux varies as the square of the length. The 5 significant digits was preserved to illustrate that the nonlinear temperature solution also varied as \(\ \mathbf{L}^{2}\). The close agreement substantiates this assertion.

Referring to Figures 7 and 8 where peak temperature is plotted against heat flux, one may notice the peak temperature at thermal runaway is, or appears to be invariant. The maximum temperature at the wafer tip corresponding to thermal runaway is nominally 12.95\({}^{\circ}\)C, for both solutions. This condition was entirely unexpected, but has been substantiated by obtaining an approximate solution to the differential equation. The method used2 is presented in references 5 and 6. The technique is called collocation, and the procedure as applied to the differential equation yields an approximate solution valid over an interval. The method is used to approximate the solution in the vicinity of the silicon wafer maximum temperature. The resulting expression provides insight to the conditions leading to thermal runaway. To employ this method one assumes a form for

the solution to the differential equation, and forces the approximation to exactly satisfy the given equation at some set of points, or in this case at x=1/3L. At this point we are near the boundary condition where thermal runaway occurs. An evaluation using a weighted residual method has shown that points 1/3 and 2/3L are optimum in this regard.

To obtain an approximate solution using the collocation method we assume the solution to the differential equation to be of the form, T=T\({}_{\text{max}}\)(1-x\({}^{2}\)/L\({}^{2}\)). We chose this form based on our experience with the solution to the linear second order differential. We proceed to take the derivative of this expression twice and then introduce the resultant into equation (3) with the exponential term of T evaluated at x=1/3L. We obtained an expression for T\({}_{\text{max}}\) which although in terms of q\({}_{0}\), L, k, and t is not explicit in T\({}^{3}\). Since we are interested in the maximum temperature at the critical flux condition we take the derivative of this expression for T\({}_{\text{max}}\) with respect to q\({}_{0}\). This derivative goes to infinity at thermal runaway, consequently, we look for the term that causes this derivative to go to infinity. We find if :

(1/T\({}_{\text{max}}\)-8\(\alpha\)/9), becomes zero then DT\({}_{\text{max}}\)/Dq\({}_{0}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\infty\). Solving for T as a critical temperature T\({}_{\text{e}}\) we obtain

T\({}_{\text{e}}\)=9/8\(\alpha\). Where T\({}_{\text{e}}\) is the temperature at thermal runaway. Recalling that \(\alpha\)=1/11 the maximum temperature at the critical heat flux is T\({}_{\text{e}}\)=12.375\({}^{\circ}\)C. First, note that the expression for temperature at thermal runaway is a constant, independent of the heat flux or physical parameters associated with the module. This fact is in agreement with our observations from the two FE solutions. Next, it is noticed that the approximate solution is in general agreement with the FEA, i.e., we obtained through FEA 12.9503\({}^{\circ}\)C.

Our approximate solution is within roughly 4.5%. As stated earlier this approximate solution is useful in establishing the parametric dependence but can not be expected to be exact over a range of T. We chose to collocate near the thermal runaway point. The lack of agreement between the FEA at points substantially removed from this approximated condition has been verified by examining the implicit relationship obtained for T\({}_{\text{max}}\). One could explore making the approximation more exact by forcing collocation at an additional point or assuming a different form of the equation.

This approximate method of solving the nonlinear differential equation also yields an estimate of the critical heat flux q\({}_{\text{e}}\). We obtain for q\({}_{\text{e}}\) the following expression, after introducing the above relationship for T\({}_{\text{e}}\) back into the implicit equation for T where collocation was used:

\[\text{q}_{\text{e}}\text{=}\text{(2kt/eL}^{2}\text{)(9/8\alpha)}\text{\ \ where\ e=2.71828}.\]

The critical heat flux is inversely proportional to L\({}^{2}\), just as we demonstrated earlier by FEA. Evaluating this expression using k=0.15 W/mm-K, and t=0.3 mm, L=94 mm will yield for the critical heat flux:

q\({}_{\text{e}}\)=4.637 10-5 W/mm\({}^{2}\). This agrees within 5.6% of the FEA solution. Although we do not have perfect agreement with the FEA result we have produced a design equation for the critical heat flux. This relationship will be useful in our understanding of the module design. For example, the benefit of minimizing the distance L and increasing the material conductivity is quite clear. Also, we have confirmed that the thermal runaway occurs at a uniquely defined temperature governed by the value of \(\alpha\) used in our temperature dependence expression.

Figure 9: Thermal Solution of KEK Silicon Module With and Without Diamond Substrate Heat Spreader. Comparison with 94 mm Long Silicon Wafer Without Electronics Shown. Base Temperature 0\({}^{\text{e}}\)C.

Figure 9 illustrates the effect of combining the silicon wafer surface heating from leakage current with the heat load from the electronic chips. This solution is shown for the KEK module. The surface heat flux corresponding to thermal runaway is reduced somewhat. Figure 9 also depicts the previous solution for the 94 mm long silicon wafer to accentuate this effect. The KEK module temperature curve versus heat flux is shifted upward relative to this prior solution. One may notice the 94 mm long silicon wafer solution passes through 0\({}^{\circ}\)C, when the surface heat flux vanishes, where the combined KEK module curve does not. Heat is transferred from the Beryllium ground plane, on which the electronics chips are mounted, directly to the silicon wafer producing this effect. We have minimized this additional heat load in the silicon wafer by creating a stagnant gas film 1 mm in thickness between the ground plane and the silicon strip detector. This differential amounts to approximately 2\({}^{\circ}\)C. This slight differential can be reduced further by decreasing the path length from the end of the ground plane to the point of module cooling. However, the real improvement comes from introducing a thin diamond heat spreader.

The benefit of adding a 12 mm wide 300 micron thick strip of diamond to the KEK module is illustrated in Figure 9 as well. This heat spreader effectively suppresses the thermal runaway condition for a substantial range in heat flux. The present limit set for a radiation damaged detector, 4.17 \(10^{-5}\) W/mm\({}^{2}\) must increase a factor of 2.4 before a critical heat flux condition is approached. This is clearly shown in Figure 9.

In Figure 10 we have depicted both the RAL and KEK module designs. Two solutions were made for the RAL module design, one with, and another without the electronic chip heat load. One may notice a little difference between these two solutions. According to our simple 60 mm long wafer model (Fig. 8) thermal runaway should occur at nominally 12 \(10^{5}\) W/mm\({}^{2}\). The heat path distance for the surface heating to the stave in the RAL design is of this order. Without the electronic chip heat load the RAL module would appear to be approaching this condition earlier than one would first expect. It is assumed that the slightly restricted heat flow simulated for the stave mounting surface is responsible for this condition. Heat must flow out of the silicon wafer into the beryllia hybrids and through the alumina substrate before reaching the cooled surface. With the electronic chip heat load super-imposed the RAL starts to approach thermal runaway considerably sooner(\(<\)8 \(10^{-5}\) W/mm\({}^{2}\)), but still with a comfortable design margin.

The results for the KEK module have been included in Figure 10 for comparison with the RAL results. One will notice that without the thin diamond heat spreader running the length of the module, the KEK module encounters thermal runaway much earlier. The design margin for the basic KEK module is nominally 1.06 times the 600 milliwatt/module design point set by C. Haber. In contrast, the addition of the heat spreader increases this margin substantially, to nominally a margin of 2.4.

A version of the KEK module mounted to a stave like the RAL version was presented earlier. This design has not been evaluated as yet, although, there seems some merit to do so if the diamond substrate material were to be considered in that application. The near five to ten-fold increase in thermal conductivity over all the other substrate material makes diamond ideally suited to control the thermal runaway condition. The diamond is processed through a chemical-vapor-deposition process(CVD) and has a thermal conductivity of 1300 to 1700 W/m-K compared to silicon's 150 W/m-K. The production cost for producing this material has come down substantially in recent years. One of the main suppliers has estimated the price will drop to $15.5/cm\({}^{2}\) within two years, Very soon cost should not be a draw back in its application.

### Conclusions

Thermal runaway in highly irradiated silicon strip detectors has been demonstrated to exist. We have characterized this effect using both finite element methods, as well as through an approximate solution obtained from the nonlinear second order heat conduction equation. The various module designs being studied for the ATLAS Silicon Detector were reviewed with respect to thermal runaway. The various module designs being considered were found to have varying degrees of design margin depending upon their respective designs.

We observed that a critical temperature corresponding to thermal runaway is present that is not dependent upon the module design configuration nor the construction materials involved. This critical temperature is 12.95\({}^{\circ}\)C for a detector base temperature of 0\({}^{\circ}\)C. This temperature is set by the temperature dependent exponential growth in internal heating established from irradiated silicon tests. If the module design and cooling arrangement interact to permit this peak temperature in the silicon wafer to be

reached the detector will thermally runaway. The detector temperature in this analysis was held quite close to \(0^{\circ}\)C by the boundary conditions imposed. If the overall average temperature \(\rm o^{e}_{J}\) the detector is elevated by cooling system thermal gradients the thermal runaway will be encountered at a much lower critical heat flux. A detector module that has an inherently large thermal gradient from it's outermost extremities to the point of detector cooling runs a risk of thermal runaway.

Thermal runaway should not occur providing the module is adequately cooled. One way of achieving a substantial increase in the margin between the expected leakage current induced heat flux and the critical heat flux leading to runaway is to use a diamond heat spreader.
