**Abstract**

It is reported the quality control of Y11(200)MS aluminized fibers with 600 ppm of UV Absorber used to equip the Module 0 barrel hadronic calorimeter for ATLAS. The optical properties and the reflectivity of the aluminization of the fibers is presented. Also the fiber to fiber fluctuations of the several parameters were studied.

## 1 Introduction

The Module 0 is the first real size module of the barrel hadronic calorimeter for the ATLAS detector. One of the optical components of the calorimeter are the WLS fibers used to transport the signal from the scintillating tiles to the readout PMT's. The fibers that were chosen to equip the Module 0 are Kuraray Y11(200)MS fibers with 600 ppm of UV Absorber (UVA) [5, 6]. The fibers are aluminized at the oposite end of the readout, allowing an increase of the overall signal (see results in next section).

Systematic tests of the Y11(200)MS fibers were performed in order to measure their optical properties (light output and attenuation length), the reflectivity of the aluminium and the fiber to fiber fluctuations of these parameters.

The quality control of detector components is an important task for the optimization of detector properties such as energy resolution and signal uniformity.

The optical properties of plastic fibers for calorimetric applications can be characterized in terms of the light yield and attenuation length. In the past several devices were constructed for the measurement of these quantities. In the simplest configuration a single fiber is longitudinally scanned by a radioactive source and the light output is read by a photomultiplier. This type of device was used in the measurement of scintillating fibers for the SPACAL calorimeter, namely in radiation hardness studies. The main disadvantage is the time spent in replacing fibers, in particular when a big number of fibers must be tested. An important improvement was achieved by introducing an additional degree of freedom allowing the transversal movement between the radioactive source and the fibers. With this configuration several fibers can be installed on a supporting table that is moved to position the selected fiber infront of the readout system. The quality control of the scintillating fibers equipping the CHORUS calorimeters was undertaken with this type of device [2, 3].

In this paper we report on the implementation and performance of a test bench for large scale quality control of scintillating and WLS fibers. This test bench was already operated for the quality control of the WLS fibers equipping the STIC calorimeter, when ten thousand fibers were scanned for a final selection of approximately six thousand fibers. The results from these measurements are also presented and could be considered a benchmark for the performance of the setup, regarding future applications.

## 2 Experimental setup

The test bench is schematically shown in fig. 1. It consists of a X=Y MicroControle optical table provided with two independent movements, driven by two stepping motors along orthogonal directions ( **X** and **Y** ). This table is complemented by a light readout system based on a photomultiplier.

A 2.5 meters long table is moved in the X direction. This table supports a removable holder that contains the fibers to be tested. Each fiber is positioned in front of the light readout using the X motor and the Y motor moves the radiation source along the fiber length. At each position the light output from that fiber is recorded.

The test bench is automatically controlled by a MacIntosh Personal Computer. Dedicated software was developed using the LabView 1 (**LAB**oratory **V**irtual **I**nstrument **E**ngineering **W**orkbench) package.

### The XY table

The XY table consists of three main components: The main support (which is fixed), the supporting table and the radiation source holder.

The radiation source holder moves along the Y-axis in steps of 100 \(\mu\)m. The distance between the holder and the supporting table changes by less than few 1/10 mm when displacing the holder between the two extremities.

The supporting table is loaded with the fibers holder and moves along the X-axis in steps of 25 \(\mu\)m. The movement of the table ensures a constant distance between all fibers and the light readout within a precision of the order of 50 \(\mu\)m.

In fig. 2 it is shown a cross view of the supporting table and one fiber holder. One reference fiber is inserted in a black painted groove drilled along the table length and is tightly attached to the supporting table. The signal from this fixed reference fiber provides a monitorization of the stability of the readout chain and radiation source.

Each fiber holder consists of a mat black anodized aluminium plate with 33 V-shaped grooves to receive one fiber each. The distance between adjacent grooves is 3 mm. The central groove is 5 mm apart from the neighbours and receives one reference fiber. This fiber is removed and reinserted whenever the holder is filled with new fibers, and undergoes the same alignment procedure together with the other fibers.

Two 250 cm long holders are used. The use of two identical holders allows to reduce the dead time: one set of fibers is automatically measured while the second holder is filled with new fibers.

### The radiation source

The test bench is provided with two alternative sources of radiation. When testing scintillating fibers a \({}^{90}\)Sr radioactive source is used. If **W**ave**L**ength **S**hifter ( **WLS** ) fibers are under test a blue scintillator (injection molded polystyrene doped with 1.5% PTP and 0.05% POPOP) is inserted in front of the \({}^{90}\)Sr source. The light from the scintillator is then used to excite the WLS fibers. To enhance its light output the scintillator is wrapped with aluminized mylar. A schematic illustration of this assembly is shown in fig. 3.

Any possible saturation resulting in nonlinearity of the light yield from the WLS

Figure 1: _The test bench: a) side view; b) top view_

fibers was checked by placing several Neutral Density filters of different attenuation factors between the scintillator and one fiber. In fig. 4 the measured signal normalized to the signal obtained without any filter is plotted against the filter attenuation factor. The data was fitted with a second order polynomial; the quadratic term is a factor of 1000 smaller than the linear term. From this measurement it is concluded that no saturation exists.

### The stepping motors

On the X-axis the movement is transmitted from the motor to the table by a screw. The movement of the radiation source holder along the Y-axis is achieved using a profiled rubber tape. Both motors are connected to an electronically controlled power unit, driven by a MacIntosh PC via GPIB (General Purpose Instrumentation Bus) interface.

As the position of the table on the X-axis is considered to be critical, the corresponding stepping motor is provided with a built-in opto-electrical system that will warn the operator whenever a mismatch has occurred between the number of steps performed by the motor and the requested displacement.

#### 2.3.1 The motor control electronics

Two major functions are found in the TL78 and IP28 MicroControle units : the TL78 takes care of the power feeding to the motors and the IP28 sends out the proper signals to the motors via the TL78.

Figure 2: _Cross view of the supporting table and one fiber holder_

The TL78 also features the possibility of directly controlling the position of the table (X-axis) with the help of a real time display.

The IP28 is an intelligent stepping motor controller, optimized to reduce the possibility of under or over-run of the motor. It will automatically progressively increase the pulse rate during the initial phase of the movement and decrease it before reaching the end of the movement. The only information needed is the total number of steps and the axis of movement. It can be controlled manually using push buttons on its front panel, but the commands are usually sent to the IP28 by a computer provided with a GPIB interface.

### The light readout

The light readout system consists of a blue sensitive EMI 9813KB photomultiplier (PM) coupled to a light guide. The signal from the PM is read by a pico Amperimeter.

The PM and light guide are enclosed in a cylindrical metallic housing with a light opaque black disc fixed at the end near the fibers. This disc has a diameter of 55 mm and a thickness of 300 \(\mu m\), and has a 1 cm height, 1 mm wide slit at the center.

The slit allows the detection of the light from the selected fiber, while avoiding the light from the neighbour fibers as illustrated in the left picture of fig. 5. Two fibers (B and C) were inserted in adjacent grooves and between fibers A and B one groove was left empty.

Figure 3: _The excitation source assembly used when testing WLS fibers._

The two right plots show the measured signal as a function of the relative position of the slit, obtained with a transversal scan of the three fibers across the slit. The top (bottom) plot was obtained with a gap between the fibers and the slit equal to 1 mm (2 mm).

The slit width was optimized for the quality control of a large number of fibers of the same type. However it's width influences the relative contribution of the light emerging from the cladding and the core of the fiber. A detailed study of this effect was performed [4], showing that the slit dimensions are correlated with the measured attenuation length. This effect is understood by noticing that the attenuation length of the cladding component is smaller than that from the core. Therefore if the slit aperture is reduced the contribution from the cladding light decreases and the measured attenuation length is increased. Special care is mandatory when testing and comparing different types of fibers, where the slit dimensions must be carefully defined.

#### 2.4.1 Light cross-talk

The contribution from one neighbour fiber to the signal of the fiber that is centered with the slit defines the light cross-talk. It depends on the distance between the two adjacent fibers and the size of the gap between the fibers and the slit. In order to quantify this dependence one single fiber was scanned across the slit. The measured signal is shown in fig. 6 for a gap of 1 mm and 2 mm, respectively the top and bottom plots.

The light cross-talk for a distance **d** between adjacent fibers is obtained from the single fiber scan by:

Figure 4: _The light output vs neutral density filter attenuation factor._

\[Cross-talk=\frac{S_{d}}{S_{m\,ax}} \tag{1}\]

where \(S_{m\,ax}\) is the signal maximum (obtained when the fiber is centered with the slit) and \(S_{d}\) the signal measured when the fiber is at the distance \(\mathbf{d}\) from the previous position.

The results are summarized in table 1. For a gap of 2 mm the light cross-talk is reduced to a neglectable level if the fibers are more than 6 mm apart.

### The on-line monitoring program

The test bench is automatically controlled by a MacII personal computer, taking care of the movements of both motors and the control and readout of the DMM. A dedicated software was developed using the National Instruments LabView 2.1 package.

Figure 5: _The role of the slit in cutting the light from the fibers adjacent to the selected one is illustrated in the left picture. In the right plots it is shown the measured signal as a function of the transversal position of the slit, for a gap of 1 mm (top) and 2 mm (bottom) between the fibers and the slit._

The interface with the user is provided by a front panel, shown in fig. 7, where several parameters can be checked and/or modified. The program also takes care of the on-line data analysis, consisting mainly in the computation of the light yield and attenuation length of each tested fiber, by an exponential fit to the light output data. The results are presented in a report page as shown in fig. 8. It contains, besides some relevant data concerning the measurement of the reference fiber and the noise level, a table displaying the results of the on-line analysis. A graphic with the light output as a function of the source position is plotted for each fiber. This report page is very useful for a real time control of the ongoing measurements and an efficient trouble handling. The raw data and the results of the online analysis are also stored on disk.

The fibers measurement cycle

To maximize the number of fibers tested in each measurement while keeping the light cross-talk at a small level, each holder is filled with sixteen fibers, 6 mm apart from each other, plus the additional reference fiber in the central groove. This reference fiber provides an estimation of the alignment reproducibility.

The noise level is determined in the beginning of each measurement cycle after moving the radiation source outside the fibers region, and is subtracted from the fibers signal. It is of the order of 1 nA while the signal from the fibers is not less than 100 nA. Therefore, for usual WLS fibers a signal to noise ratio of 100 or better is achieved.

The optimal position of each fiber in front of the slit is then searched by performing a transversal scan with a 200 \(\mu\)m step. The result is a peak structure with the maxima occurring when one fiber is centered with the slit. The position of each maximum is determined by fitting a parabola to each peak.

Finally the fibers measurement begins. Each fiber is moved to the position found in the previous step and the radiation source scans the fiber in predefined longitudinal positions.

The fixed reference fiber is measured before and after the 17 fibers are tested. The mean value of the light output obtained in these two measurements with the radiation source at 20 cm from the PM is used as a global normalization factor for the 17 fibers. The final result is therefore independent from any instability of the readout chain or changes in the scintillator light yield due to an ageing process.

## 4 Experimental Results

Mo dule 0 is equiped with fibers of different lengths (two lengths for each cell). Typical values are: 135 cm, 155 cm,165 cm, 195 cm, 235 cm and 250 cm. Two tests were performed at different times. The experimental setup was described in other notes [5].

Table 3 shows the light output for the several lenghts of fibers as well as the effective attenuation length, with the RMS next to it in %. To extract the effective attenuation length, a fit with one exponential function was performed:

\[I(x)=I_{0}\exp\left(-\frac{x}{L_{att}}\right) \tag{2}\]

The region of the fit is indicated in the second column of tables 3Figure 9: Five Y11(200)MS fibers, 235 cm long. Light output as a function of excitement point to the PMT.
