It was the task of the ATLAS Magnet Panel to recommend to the collaboration one of the three options for the muon spectrometer magnet configuration:

1) superconducting air-core barrel [1] and superconducting air-core end-cap [2] toroids,
2) iron-core barrel and iron-core end-cap toroids [3],
3) superconducting air-core barrel [1] and iron-core end-cap [4] toroids.

The magnet panel unanimously recommends option 1: all superconducting air-core toroids. This recommendation is based on the detailed study of the physics performance, the technical feasibility, the integration within the whole ATLAS detector, the construction and installation schedule, and the cost of the magnet system, where the guiding principle was that the muon spectrometer should not be optimized at the expense of other subdetectors. Also, the complementarity of the ATLAS magnet with respect to a high-field solenoid which is the likely choice for the second general-purpose LHC detector, was considered. The present document summarizes our conclusions.

Our Panel has benefited enormously from the excellent work of many colleagues in our collaboration and from consultations with outside experts. We would like to express our appreciation and gratitude to all of them.

## 1 Physics Performance

Excellent muon, electron, and \(\gamma\) resolution and identification as well as good jet and missing \(E_{T}\) resolution are the strong points of the ATLAS detector. The most important consideration in our study was to obtain the best possible performance of the muon spectrometer, within technical and financial constraints.

The all air-core magnet solution provides a stand-alone muon spectrometer with a better resolution (Fig. 1) over the full acceptance, than the all iron-core toroid option with the inner tracking included in the measurement (Fig. 2). In addition, the air-core system allows the \(p_{t}\) threshold on the muon trigger to be lowered to about 6 or 7 GeV/c (depending on RPClayout and trigger logic), while the energy lost by a muon traversing the iron toroid limits the threshold to about \(p_{t}>12\) GeV/c. As described in Refs. [5, 6, 7] both of these aspects clearly improve the physics performance of the ATLAS detector. We summarize below the most important points.

First and foremost,the better resolution of the all-air option (the dimuon and four-muon mass resolution is roughly a factor 3 better than in the all-iron option) permits the extraction of resonance signals of an intermediate-mass Higgs in multi-muon channels in a stand-alone mode (see Fig. 3 and Ref. [6]). Even for a heavier Higgs (m\(\thicksim\) 200 GeV/\(c^{2}\)), where the use of the Z-mass constraint considerably reduces the difference in Higgs mass resolution between the various magnet options, the physics analysis is simpler with a stand-alone air-core system. Kinematic cuts alone give a very clear signal above an easily measurable background; whereas further cuts are necessary, in the case of the iron-core magnet, to extract a signal above a more poorly defined background (see Fig. 4 and Ref. [6]). The better detector performance results in a greater discovery potential, which can be expressed as a function of integrated luminosity. Assuming a significance of 5\(\sigma\), the Higgs discovery potential in stand-alone mode (Fig. 5) starts at a much lower integrated luminosity for the full air-core system than for the other two magnet options: a 200 GeV/\(c^{2}\) S.M. Higgs, for instance, could be detected for luminosities below \(10^{33}\)\(cm^{-2}s^{-1}\)[6]. For a heavier Higgs (m \(>\) 300 GeV/\(c^{2}\)), the air-core magnet system is able to measure the width of the Higgs with sufficient precision to distinguish a Standard Model Higgs from a SUSY Higgs, providing an important cross-check of the measurement of the production cross-section, or of the interpretation of the result. Finally, new physics (Z\({}^{\prime}\), WW states etc.) in the TeV range, would clearly benefit from a more accurate muon momentum measurement.

The lower \(p_{t}\) trigger threshold allowed by the air-core magnet is important in several areas. For instance, the increase in the number of detectable \(B\to\psi K_{S}\) events translates into a factor of 1.5 to 2 improvement on the accuracy of the CP-violation parameter \(sin2\beta\)[7]. This advantage of the air-core system is independent of the inner tracking, which is on the other hand essential to \(B\)-physics studies in itself. In addition, if explicit muon identification is required to limit combinatorial background under the \(J/\psi\) peak, the redundancy of two muon momentum measurements of comparable accuracy, in the inner tracker and the muon spectrometer, should simplify muon identification and reconstruction in the difficult low momentum region (\(p_{t}\approx\) 5 GeV/\(c\)).

Muon identification at very low momentum, combined with precision vertex tracking, also allows an improvement in the \(H\to 4l\) performance. The \(p_{t}\)-threshold reduction down to 7 or maybe 6 GeV/\(c\), results in a significant increase in the number of signal events, while the background is kept at approximately the same level by a cut on the sum of the four muon impact parameters [8].

Excellent momentum resolution and the capability to trigger and analyse very low \(p_{t}\) muons are also a prerequisite for the study of \(\Upsilon\)-states produced in heavy ion collisions. This 'Spectral Analysis of Strongly Interacting Matter' extends the argument of J/\(\psi\)-suppression to \(\Upsilon\)-states [9]. It is argued that the suppression of the \(\Upsilon\)(2S) state relative to the \(\Upsilon\)(1S) as a function of energy density would provide a sensitive discrimination between hot hadronic matter and the quark-gluon plasma. The stand-alone capability of the muon detector is quite essential in this case, since the occupancy of the inner detector will be an order of magnitude higher than in high-luminosity proton-proton collisions.

We studied the potential of the ATLAS detector (without modifications), using the barrel air-core muon spectrometer with its stand-alone measurement capability. The invariant mass resolution for \(\Upsilon\)- states was estimated to be \(\sigma=300\) MeV/\(c^{2}\). It may be improved to \(\sigma=250\) MeV/\(c^{2}\), if the muon energy loss can be measured in the back segment of the hadronic calorimeter. While this mass resolution is not quite adequate to fully separate the 1S and 2S states (\(\Delta m=563\) MeV/\(c^{2}\)), a line shape analysis would provide information on the relative contributions of \(\Upsilon\)- and \(\Upsilon^{\prime}\)-states. Critical for achieving adequate sensitivity is the understanding of the continuum background, dominated by the combinatorial background from pion and kaon decay. This background is proportional to the square of the particle multiplicity. A preliminary analysis indicates that the combinatorial background will be low enough and the luminosity high enough if ion collisions with \(A\leq 100\) are studied. Adequate sensitivity to \(\Upsilon^{\prime}\)-suppression can be achieved in one month of running. Variations on the energy density would be achieved by varying the projectiles: a factor of three could be achieved using S, Ca, and Nb ions.

We also compared the various muon spectrometer options of ATLAS with the muon system of CMS. Considering the fully stand-alone capabilities of ATLAS (Fig. 1) and CMS (Fig. 6) [10], the air-core option of ATLAS yields a better resolution than CMS everywhere, except for the highest transverse momenta (\(p_{t}>500\) GeV/\(c\)) in the central region (\(\eta<0.8\)), where the intrinsic solenoid performance outweighs that of a toroid. Even when the outermost four inner tracking layers of CMS are included in the muon measurement, the ATLAS resolution is better for \(p_{t}<300\) GeV/\(c\) (Fig. 7). However, when the full inner tracking is included in the muon measurements, the CMS detector exhibits better muon momentum resolution than ATLAS (Fig. 8).

As shown in Fig. 9, the muon chamber layout has been improved since the LoI. By adding sagitta chambers in the region \(1.2<\eta<1.4\), and by moving the outer muon chambers of the end-caps to the wall of the cavern, the resolution can be improved considerably in the region \(\eta>1.3\) (Fig. 10). This provides some flexibility to reduce the field in the end-cap air-core toroids, simplifying magnet construction and reducing costs. We conclude that the all-iron as well as the air-core barrel and iron core end-cap solutions, are both inferior to the CMS muon system in almost all aspects. In contrast, the all-air option is considerably better in the fully stand-alone mode, and remains competitive with CMS, even when the lower occupancy section of the CMS inner tracking is included in the measurement.

To conclude this section, the advantages of the air-core option, from the physics viewpoint, can be summarized as follows:

* stand-alone muon momentum measurement, that compares very favorably with that in other LHC detectors, and is more accurate than the ATLAS inner tracking muon momentum measurement over most of the kinematic range. The Panel believes that the ability to extract resonant signals in multi-muon channels in a stand-alone mode, is a powerful tool, which allows us to independently compare such signals with those obtained in the electron channels. This redundancy may turn out to be essential for the identification of weak signals.
* better muon momentum resolution, over the full rapidity acceptance, than the full-iron option, even when inner tracking is included in the measurement (for \(p_{t}\ >30\) GeV/\(c\)).

* muon-trigger capability down to lower threshold (\(p_{t}>\) 6-7 GeV/\(c\)) than the iron-core magnet (\(p_{t}>\) 12 GeV/\(c\));
* ability to identify and measure muons down to very low moment a (\(p_{t}>\) 5 GeV/\(c\)) in the high-multiplicity heavy ion environment;
* ability to maintain the full muon capability, in low occupancy detectors, at LHC luminosities in excess of 1.7 10\({}^{4}\)\(cm^{-2}s^{-1}\), if they become available.

## 2 Technical Feasibility

On a common meeting between the ATLAS Collaboration and the LHCC Magnet Advisory Group on Dec. 1, 1992, many questions like technical feasibility, operational safety and estimated costs for the various magnet options were discussed. A summary of these discussions is given in Ref. [11]. The consensus of the experts in the magnet advisory group was that both systems: air-core and iron-core, are, without any doubt, technically feasible. The operation of all magnet versions was judged quite safe. In the following we summarize the essential conclusions presented by the magnet experts.

The proposed air-core toroids are using a relatively classical design for the conductor. This means that the problems are known and precautions can be taken to avoid them. The criteria adopted for the conductor stability and the magnet quench protection are conservative. The air-core magnets are demanding due to their unusually large size and complex assembly. Because of the rather conservative conductor design, the operation of the air core magnets is considered quite safe within expected standards. The experience with many superconducting magnets in the world and in particular at CERN is very good.

The cool down time for the barrel toroid is estimated to be one month. It depends on the cooling power of the refrigerator and could be shortened at higher cost. This is perhaps not necessary, since normally a magnet is cooled down only once and forever. The quench recovery (cool down time from 50 K to 4 K) will take about 5 days, depending on the available cooling power. The current ramping will take about 2 hours. For a faster ramping (Eddy current limit \(\sim\) 1 hour) one would need a stronger power supply. Switching off the magnet current will take somewhat longer, unless special systems are used.

Correspondingly, the cool down time for the end cap toroids is estimated to be 2 weeks. The quench recovery will be about 10 hours, the magnet ramping time 1 hour and the switch-off time 2 hours. For comparison the ALEPH superconducting solenoid cools down in less than a week.

It is planned to have one common refrigerator system for all ATLAS superconducting magnets, which also will be used to perform the necessary magnet tests on the CERN site, prior to their installation in the underground experimental area.

The need of infrastructure from CERN for the assembly and the tests for either magnet option is large. This has to be studied more carefully. The construction and installation times, as given in the LoI, were considered to be reasonable.

The estimated operating costs for the iron-core and the air-core toroids are about the same. The electrical power consumption will be 1.3 MW for the air-core toroids and 4 MW for the iron-core toroids. The smaller power bill in the case of the air-core toroid will be essentially compensated by the higher manpower and maintenance costs of the refrigerator or system.

It is our understanding that the LHC magnet panel has confirmed these early conclusions, and is summarizing them in their report [12].

## 3 Experimental Area and Detector Integration

The size and weight of the proposed magnets will require considerable infrastructure installations. Conceptual studies of the installation procedures and necessary infrastructure have been carried out for both magnet solutions. They are described in Refs. [3] and [13].

The experimental area for the iron toroid consists of a large access shaft, 33 m in diameter, through which the entire magnet structure can be installed directly into its final position. The relatively short barrel section (14.1 m long) permits a convenient axial installation of all detector components, since the complete withdrawal of the end-cap sections (limited only by the low-\(\beta\) quadrupoles) provides a 8 m long installation area.

The overall dimensions of the air toroid are larger. The length of the barrel (26 m) implies a different size and layout of the experimental area. In order to allow convenient installation of the magnet and provide sufficient space for the axial installation of the detector, while at the same time limiting the excavated volume, it is possible to construct an elliptical access shaft, the major axis of which would roughly match the length of the underground cavern (44 m).

Both magnet versions will undergo pre-assembly (and, for the air-core toroids, full-current tests) in a surface assembly hall before underground installation. The space required for assembly, tests, and storage on the surface, as estimated for the two designs, is shown in Table 3. The reason why the iron toroid requires about 3000 m\({}^{2}\) less space is that iron-core parts are stored on the surface in batches of relatively small-sized components, which are then lowered into the cavern and assembled underground. In contrast, the air-core barrel coils are fully tested on the surface, two coils at a time. They are then assembled into modules of two or four coils, and these modules are lowered, as a whole, into the cavern.

The accessibility of the detector elements and the associated electronics is of vital importance for repair and maintenance operations. The access to the inner cavity of the iron toroid will require the displacement of the end toroids, which is regarded as a relatively easy operation. The access to some of the muon chambers, situated between the calorimeter and the iron yoke, would require a partial de-mounting of adjacent muon chambers. The open structure of the air toroid provides a rather easy access to the muon chambers, provided that access-platforms can be installed in between the muon chamber layers. The access to the inner detectors requires the displacement of the superconducting end-cap toroid. This

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l r r} \hline  & iron toroid & air toroid \\ \hline Hall space & 1 600m\({}^{2}\) & 4 300m\({}^{2}\) \\ Storage space & 1750m\({}^{2}\) & 2050m\({}^{2}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Necessary assembly hall and storage space.

presents no inherent problems, but will require an additional set of helium ports to keep the endcaps cold in case of prolonged access.

The construction schedule and the installation time for the two magnet versions have been analyzed in great detail [14, 15, 16], and are summarized in Table 3.

The construction schedule indicated above assumes, for both magnet versions, the availability of a surface assembly hall 1.5 to 2 years before the installation in the underground area. The earliest installation date of the magnets in the experimental cavern will depend on civil engineering options and on the overall LHC program. It must be considered as highly unlikely, however, that LHC can be ready within 4 to 5 years and, therefore, neither magnet will be on the critical construction path of the ATLAS experiment. In fact, the most critical part of the construction of either magnet is the interference between the magnet design phase and the design of other parts of the detector. The installation times in the experimental area are only given as indicative of the relative comparison of the different magnet versions. In the overall installation scenario for the complete experiment it is clear that the magnet installation will be interleaved with the installation of other parts of the detector.

The implication of the two magnet versions on the installation of the muon chambers remains to be worked out in detail. This topic has been under active study, resulting in substantial progress since the LoI. Of particular concern at the present time are the two or three lower sectors of the air-core barrel, where support pillars complicate the chamber installation procedure.

## 4 Muon Chambers

It was concluded that with the information currently available, there is no critical or decisive issue in connection with the muon tracking system, which could alter the choice of the magnet system. The options proposed in the LoI for the muon tracking system can be incorporated in either system.

The areas covered by muon chambers are very similar: \(\sim 5350m^{2}\) for the all-air-core, and \(5500m^{2}\) for the all-iron option. The multi-hit capability of the various muon chamber technologies is still under study. For the air core option, the requirements on multi-hit capability are perhaps less stringent than for the iron option. However, in both versions there are chambers behind the calorimeters, which have to deal with particle showers. The required rate capability of the chambers appear similar for both options because the counting rate may be dominated by the neutron background in the experimental hall.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline  & Iron-core toroid & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Air-core toroid} \\ \hline  & & Barrel & End-cap \\ \hline \hline Engineering/design & \(<\)1 year & 2 years & 2 years \\ before first order & & & \\ Construction/assembly & 3 years & 3.5 years & 4 years \\ Installation/test in cavern & 30 weeks & 22 weeks & 12 weeks \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Construction and installation time For the iron toroid, the geometrical acceptance of the chamber system may be slightly larger; the chamber support structures are simpler and less costly. However, a recent proposal to reduce the number of superconducting coils from 12 to 10 in the air-core case, coupled to a simplified cold mass and cryostat design, holds the potential to further reduce the phase space obstructed by cryostats and feet. This new design also simplifies chamber installation, access and maintenance, and reduces to a few percent the fraction of azimuthal space with either no coverage, or multiple-scattering-limited momentum resolution. These topics are being actively studied, and, while they cause justified concern, we recognize that there remains ample opportunity to optimize chamber layout and reduce dead spaces.

The implementation of the muon trigger will differ in detail for the two magnet versions; we do not, however, expect striking differences, which would have an impact on the magnet choice. In both cases, we expect to be driven again by the level of neutron flux in outer (trigger) chambers of the muon spectrometer. In both versions, we may expect counting rates up to 100 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\).

The muon chamber alignment is one of the most critical tasks in the spectrometer. We have developed conceptual alignment schemes for both magnet versions. Again, we do not see any major differences in complexity or costs, which in our view, should enter into the consideration of the magnet choice.

The temperature stabilization of the outside cryostat walls is still under study, but no major problems are expected.

## 5 Cost Estimates

The cost estimates in the LoI were based on the work of experts (Saclay for the air-core barrel, RAL for the air-core end-caps, and CERN for the iron-core magnet) with wide experience in magnet construction. Since the fall of 1992, a number of major industrial companies were extensively consulted [14, 15, 16], resulting in updated and more reliable cost estimates, which are summarized in Table 5.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline  & air-core barrel & iron-core barrel & air-core barrel \\  & + air-core end-cap & + iron-core end-cap & + iron-core end-cap \\  & toroids & toroids & toroids \\ \hline barrel & 84 & MCHF & & 84 \\  & & 71.4 & MCHF & \\ end-caps & 34 & MCHF & & 8.5 \\ \hline  & 118 & MCHF & 71.4 & MCHF & 92.5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Cost estimates of the three magnet options. These include contingencies of 15 % for the air-core barrel, 5 % for the air-core endcaps, and 20 % for the iron-core toroids. In the air-core case, it is assumed that the He-refrigerator from the LHC machine can be used. All other parts of the cryogenic installation are included in the table. The cost would increase by 6 & MCHF for a fully independent refrigeration plant.

These estimates include design studies, manufacturing, transport from the factories to CERN, refrigerator and cryogenics, power supplies and electrical systems, surface assembly and testing at CERN, installation in the underground hall, as well as cryogenic and magnetic acceptance tests after installation is completed. They do not contain infrastructure needs at CERN, such as surface buildings, cranes etc. For the all-air-core and hybrid options, an estimated 5.7 MCHF has to be added for the support structure of the calorimeters and the end-cap magnets; this amount is already included in the updated overall ATLAS cost as quoted, for instance, in the staging document [17].

Manpower needed from CERN during the assembly, test and installation phase is included in the cost quoted for the iron-core toroid. The air-core cost estimate includes all personnel necessary for the design, construction, testing and installation as described above and in Ref. [14, 15]. CERN liaison personnel are not included. Support personnel such as crane drivers are included in the Experimental Infrastructure budget given to the CORE committee. Finally, an additional two or three technicians will be required to operate and maintain the refrigerator and cryogenics plant; these will be needed throughout the life of the experiment, and their cost covered by the ATLAS operating budget.

## 6 Concluding Remarks

The Magnet Panel strongly recommends the all air-core solution for its superior momentum resolution, greater discovery potential, and better stand-alone capability.

The air-core endcap with the new muon chamber layout exhibits, for \(\eta>1.5\), a muon momentum resolution considerably better than that of iron-core end-caps with the inner tracking included in the measurement. In addition, its performance is superior, in the forward direction, to that of either of the high-field solenoids proposed as an LHC detector. For these reasons, the Panel definitely favours the all-air-core over the hybrid option.

It is the Panel's opinion that our recommendation for the highest-performance muon spectrometer must not jeopardize the physics performance of the inner tracking, the electromagnetic calorimetry, and the hermetic hadronic calorimetry with good jet and missing \(E_{T}\) resolution. The Panel recognizes that its recommendation implies the staging of the air-core endcaps in order to meet the current financial constraints. It also encourages the ongoing downgrading studies of the muon spectrometer.
