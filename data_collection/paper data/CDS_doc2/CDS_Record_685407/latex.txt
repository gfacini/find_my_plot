###### Abstract

In the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model two nearly degenerate light Higgs bosons (\(h^{0}\), \(A^{0}\)) exist when \(m_{A}\) is in the range from 90 to 125 GeV. Decay of these Higgs bosons to muons has a small branching ratio, but can be detected taking advantage of the mass resolution. In this note the possibility to extract the \(pp\to b\bar{b}h^{0}/A^{0}\to b\bar{b}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) signal from the background is investigated.

## 1 Introduction

In the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model, three neutral Higgs bosons exist (h, H and A in order of increasing mass). After choosing an appropriate benchmark scenario [1] their relative masses and couplings are determined by two free parameters: the mass of the heavier CP even Higgs boson \(m_{A}\) and the ratio of the expectation values of the vacuum for the two Higgs doublets \(\tan\beta\). In the maximal mixing 1 benchmark scenario, the two lightest Higgs bosons are nearly degenerate up to an \(A^{0}\) mass of approximately 125 GeV. For \(A^{0}\) masses over 125 GeV the \(A^{0}\) is nearly degenerate with the heavy CP-even Higgs boson \(H^{0}\). MSSM Higgs bosons lighter than \(\sim\) 90 GeV have been excluded by the LEP experiments [2, 3, 4].

Footnote 1: Also known as maximal \(m_{h}\) scenario. This choice implies heavy superpartners, ie \(M_{SUSY}=1TeV\) and maximal mixing in the scalar top sector, ie \(X_{t}^{\overline{MS}}=\sqrt{6}\,M_{SUSY}\) (Renormalization Group calculations)

In the ATLAS physics TDR [5], the observability of \(A^{0}\) and \(H^{0}\) (that is for \(m_{A}>125\) GeV) has been studied in detail using the \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) and \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decay channels. The observation of the \(h^{0}\) and \(A^{0}\) bosons (for the MSSM with \(m_{A}<125\) GeV) is more challenging due to the overwhelming Z background. In this note an attempt to use the excellent invariant mass resolution of the \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) channel to extract the \(h^{0}/A^{0}\) signal from the background is reported. The channel has been studied for \(m_{A}\) and \(\tan\beta\) ranging from 70 to 130 GeV and 1 to 50, respectively.

In the MSSM the Higgs bosons are produced directly (\(q\bar{q}\to A^{0}/h^{0}\), \(gg\to A^{0}/h^{0}\) ) or in association with quarks (\(gg\to A^{0}/h^{0}b\bar{b}\) and \(q\bar{q}\to A^{0}/h^{0}b\bar{b}\) ). The associated production cross section is enhanced for large values of \(\tan\beta\). Moreover, tagging one of the b-jets leads to a rather substantial reduction of the background from Drell-Yan production of Z bosons (\(q\bar{q}\to Z^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\)). In this study only the associated channel is investigated.

An important source of irreducible background is associated production of Z bosons (\(pp\to Z^{0}b\bar{b}\)). In this note a first attempt to extract the narrow Higgs signal from the \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) background is reported. The method takes advantage of the similarity of the shape of the irreducible \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) background in the signal sample and in a reference sample that satisfies all kinematical cuts except the b-tag. After extraction of the signal, the significance is estimated and compared to conventional estimators like \(S/\sqrt{B}\) or \(S/B\).

Some properties of the MSSM are discussed in section 2. Section 3 is devoted to the simulation of signal and background events. In section 4 the detector response and the kinematical cuts used to reduce the background are discussed. The method developed to extract the signal from the irreducible background is presented in section 5. Finally, the most important findings of this study and the conclusions are summarised in sections 6 and 7.

## 2 MSSM Higgs properties

The Higgs sector of the maximal mixing MSSM is determined by two free parameters: \(m_{A}\) and \(\tan\beta\). In this section the variation of two important properties of the Higgs sector - the natural width of the \(h^{0}\) and \(A^{0}\) bosons and the mass difference between the two Higgs bosons - is discussed.

The \(A^{0}\) and \(h^{0}\) are nearly degenerate for low values of the \(A^{0}\) mass. Both masses remain close until they decouple quite abruptly when the \(h^{0}\) boson reaches its maximum mass. In the maximal mixing scenario the decoupling limit varies slightly with \(\tan\beta\), but is nowhere larger than approximately 125 GeV. Figure 1 shows the variation of the mass difference between the \(h^{0}\) and \(A^{0}\) across the \(m_{A}-\tan\beta\) plane. Only in a small region the mass difference becomes larger than a few GeV. The possibility of measuring both Higgs separately or alternatively using the effective width of the sum of both signals to determine \(\tan\beta\) is discussed in section 6.

The dependence of the natural width of both Higgs bosons on their mass and \(\tan\beta\) is shown in figure 2. The natural widths depend strongly on \(\tan\beta\). For values of \(\tan\beta\) of up to 20 the Higgs bosons are narrow compared to the invariant mass resolution of the muon pair. For larger values of \(\tan\beta\) the widths increase rapidly to reach approximately 6 GeV for \(\tan\beta=50\). The dependence on the \(A^{0}\) mass is generally smooth, with one exception: the width of the h boson decreases rapidly

The branching ratio of the \(h\) and \(A\) boson to a muon pair is around \(3\!\cdot\!10^{-4}\)[6]. Although the total width of both Higgs bosons varies substantially over the parameter space under study, the branching ratio is nearly independent of

and \(\tan\beta\), with a maximal variation of 10-20 %.

## 3 Event Simulation

In this section the simulation of the signal and background processes is discussed. First, a brief overview of the programs and tools is given. Then, two approaches to the calculation of the signal cross section are discussed. Finally, the relevant background processes are listed.

Signal and background events are generated using PYTHIA 6.157. PYTHIA is also used to calculate the cross sections in the shower approach. The cross section of the Matrix Element cross sections for associated production of MSSM Higgs boson with b-quarks are calculated using the HQQ program [7]. The equivalent process of the Z boson is available in PYTHIA as an external process [8]. The branching ratios of Higgs and Z bosons to muons for different values \(m_{A}\) and \(\tan\beta\) have been calculated using HDECAY [6] and PYTHIA, respectively.

A number of different approaches to the calculation of the signal and background cross sections are available. In the shower approach [9] the cross section of associated production of Higgs and Z bosons is calculated using the diagram of figure 3(a). The associated b-jets in the event originate from the backward evolution of the b-quark to its parent gluon. In this calculation the gluon splitting into \(b\overline{b}\) is factorised into the b-quark density. Cross sections for h/A/Z + light jets can be calculated in a similar way.

In the Matrix Element approach the cross section is calculated using diagrams

like the one in figure 3(b). The gluon splitting into \(b\overline{b}\) is now explicitly calculated as part of the diagram.

Signal and background cross sections in both approaches are shown in figures 4. Some results are listed in table 1. The NLO results obtained using the shower approach deviate considerably from leading order calculations in the Matrix Element approach. For a detailed comparison of both methods the reader is referred to reference [10]. The uncertainty in the production rates will of course carry over into the determination of the significances. The results, reported in section 6, are therefore given for both methods.

In either calculation, the coupling of the Higgs bosons to b-quarks is proportional to \(\tan\beta\) ( \(\sin\alpha/\cos\beta\) for the \(h^{0}\)), leading to a strong enhancement of the cross section at large \(\tan\beta\). For the calculation of the Yukawa coupling a running quark mass of \(m_{b}(M_{Z})\sim 3\) GeV has been used.

Throughout the relevant invariant mass range (70\(-\)130 GeV), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) production is the dominant background. The \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) is produced directly \(q\bar{q}\to Z\) (Drell-Yan production) and in association with b-quarks \(gg\to Z^{0}b\bar{b}\) and \(q\bar{q}\to Z^{0}\,b\bar{b}\).

A second source of background is \(t\bar{t}\) production. The top quarks decay into \(W^{+}b\) (\(W^{-}\overline{b}\)). The subsequent decay of both W boson into a muon and a neutrino produces the muon pair. This background becomes dominant only for \(m_{A}>125\) GeV.

Detector simulation and kinematical cuts

The detection of the current channel in the ATLAS detector relies heavily on the performance of the tracker and the muon system during high luminosity operation. Essential are the efficient reconstruction of muon tracks and the precise determination of the invariant mass of the muon pair from the decay of the Higgs. Also very important is the possibility to tag b-jets with a high rejection of light (uds and c) quarks. In this section the detector simulation and the kinematical cuts used to reduce the background are presented.

To simulate the geometrical acceptance and the detector response, the ATLAS fast simulation (version 00-02-21) is used [11].

The selection cuts used in this analysis are listed below:

* a muon pair with an invariant mass in the window \(m_{A}-4\) GeV \(<M_{\mu\mu}<m_{A}+4\) GeV
* at least one muon with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV
* \(p_{T}>6\) GeV for the second muon
* The missing transverse energy of the event \(E_{Tmiss}<40\) GeV
* at least one tagged b-jet with \(p_{T}>25\) GeV

The minimum \(p_{T}\) for muons is taken to be 6 GeV. In our analysis, at least one of the muons in the pair is required to have a transverse momentum superior to 20 GeV (trigger requirement). Muons are assumed to be identified with an efficiency of 90 % [5]. The intrinsic invariant mass resolution for muon pairs combining the inner detector and the muon system is assumed to be 1.3 GeV in this mass range [11].

Additional rejection of the \(t\overline{t}\) background without much loss of the signal is achieved by requiring the total missing transverse energy in the event to be less than 40 GeV 2

Footnote 2: Setting this value in ATLFAST may be rather optimistic. As the \(t\overline{t}\) background is not dominant anywhere in the mass range under study, loosening this cut to \(E_{T}<100\) does not have a significant effect on the final results.

The minimal transverse energy for a jet to be found and tagged is set to 25 GeV in the simulation. The b-jet energy is recalibrated using the standard ATLFAST procedure. The overwhelming Drell-Yan production is rather efficiently reduced by requiring at least one tagged b-jet in the event. Requiring a double b-tag would lead to an additional reduction of the background, but causes large signal losses due to tagging inefficiency and the geometrical acceptance.

For b-jets of \(p_{T}>25\)GeV the tagging efficiency is taken to be 50 % at high luminosity and 60 % at low luminosity. The corresponding rejection ratio for light and c jets are set to 100 and 10 respectively. These values do not take into account recent changes in the detector layout.

The signal and background processes considered in this analysis are listed in table 1 together with their production rates and the expected number of events after signal selection cuts for an integrated luminosity of 300 \(fb^{-1}\) (3 years at high luminosity).

## 5 Signal extraction

A data set was simulated that contains the contributions of the \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) and \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds and the combined signal from the \(h^{0}\) and \(A^{0}\) bosons. The number of events corresponds to three years of high luminosity running. In this section an attempt is reported to extract the signal from the background.

In a first step all kinematical cuts, except for the b-tag, are applied. Then, the b-tag is used to construct two samples: the signal sample with a single b-tag and a reference sample where the jet(s) was (were) not tagged as b's. Figure 5 shows the invariant mass distributions of both samples for the case \(m_{A}=110\),\(\tan\beta=20\). As expected, \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) production clearly dominates both samples. The number of background events in the reference sample is an order of magnitude larger than in the b-tagged sample. Therefore, the signal is visible only in the b-tagged sample.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Signal and background processes} \\ \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\(m_{A}=90\) GeV} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\(m_{A}=120\) GeV} \\ \hline _process_ & \(\sigma\times BR(pb)\) & _events_ & \(\sigma\times BR(p\,b)\) & _events_ \\ \hline \(b\overline{b}\to A^{0}\) (shower) & 0.17 & 2600 & 0.08 & 1500 \\ \hline \(gg\to A^{0}\,b\overline{b}\) (ME) & 0.037 & 670 & 0.015 & 330 \\ \hline reducible \(Z^{0}\,+\) jets (shower) & 2700 & 320 000 & 2700 & 2100 \\ \hline irreducible \(b\overline{b}\to Z^{0}\) (shower) & 58 & 810 000 & 58 & 3 900 \\ \hline irreducible \(Z^{0}\,b\overline{b}\) (ME) & 23 & 340 000 & 23 & 1500 \\ \hline \(t\overline{t}\to b\overline{b}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\nu_{\mu}\,\vec{\nu_{\mu}}\) & 5.7 & 5 600 & 5.7 & 3 900 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Table 1: A list of the most important processes involved in this measurement. For each process the cross section is given for two \(A^{0}\) masses. A second column lists the number of events expected after kinematical cuts in a mass window is \(\pm 4\) GeV around the \(A^{0}\) mass, for an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). \(\tan\beta=15\).

A fit function is constructed:

\[f(x)=N_{1}\cdot f_{V}(x;\gamma_{L},\gamma_{G},m_{Z})\cdot\left(\frac{m_{Z}}{x} \right)^{n}+\frac{N_{2}}{x^{3}}+N_{3}\cdot p_{3}(x) \tag{1}\]

where \(f_{V}\) is a pseudo-Voigtian function3, used to describe the Z line shape. Apart from the normalisation, the pseudo-Voigtian has three free parameters corresponding to the Z mass and natural width and the muon pair invariant mass resolution. The Z shape is tilted slightly by the \(\left(\frac{m_{Z}}{x}\right)^{n}\) factor to account for the luminosity function - the convolution of the parton density functions of both quarks \(\int f_{q}(x_{1},Q^{2})f_{q}(x_{2},Q^{2})dx_{1}dx_{2}\). The exponent \(n\) is set to 0.9 for light quarks and 1.2 for b-quarks, parametrising the CTEQ5L result of the luminosity function for uds and b-quarks, respectively. The \(\gamma^{*}\) and interference term are accounted for by the second term. The \(t\overline{t}\) is rather flat and is parametrised as a third degree polynomial. In these last two terms the only free parameter is the normalisation, giving a total of six free parameters.

Footnote 3: Approximation to the convolution of a Breit-Wigner and Gaussian, see [12]

The signal extraction procedure is as follows:

* The function is fitted to the light jet sample of figure 5(a) with all six parameters free.
* The Z-mass, width and detector resolution are fixed to the obtained values, leaving only the three normalisation values to vary freely.
* Then, the function is fitted to the signal sample of figure 5(b) with the three

remaining free parameters. For both samples deviations from the fit with respect to the data of up to \(\sim 5\) % remain.
* These deviations can be removed to a large extent by dividing the fit/data result from the b-jet sample by the equivalent histogram for the light jet sample.

Figure 6 shows the invariant mass distribution of the signal extracted from 5(b). The signal stands out clearly over a flat background.

For the signal of single Higgs boson or the superposition of degenerate \(A^{0}\) and \(h^{0}\), a Gaussian is an adequate description of the signal shape. After the fit of the extracted signal, the obtained mass and width are stored. The significance of the signal is estimated from the fit as the normalisation of the function divided by the uncertainty in the normalisation, ie \(h/\Delta h\).

The procedure - generation of the signal, signal extraction, fitting of the signal shape - is repeated for a mesh of points in parameter space in the range \(70\leq m_{A}\leq 130\) and \(1\leq\tan\beta\leq 50\). The results are compared to the conventional significance parameters in the next section.

## 6 Results

As explained in the previous section, the significance, mass and width of an \(A^{0}/h^{0}\) signal have been estimated for a mesh of points in the \(m_{A}-\tan\beta\) plane. In this section, the significance result is compared to more conventional estimators. The results are given for the two different approaches to the calculation of the cross section. Moreover, two integrated luminosities are considered: 30 \(fb^{-1}\), expected to be reached after 3 years of low luminosity operation, and 300 \(fb^{-1}\), corresponding to 3 years of high luminosity. Finally, the possibility to measure the fundamental parameters of the MSSM - \(m_{A}\) and \(\tan\beta\) - in this channel is discussed.

Two estimators are commonly used to determine the significance of a signal in the presence of background:

* For relatively small numbers of signal and noise events, the significance is normally estimated as \(S/\sqrt{B}\).
* For very large numbers of background events a second criterium is often added, requiring that the S/N ratio be superior to 1% to account for the uncertainty in the background description.

In figure 7 the contours of \(S/\sqrt{B}\), \(S/N\) and the \(h/\Delta h\) from the two fits in \(m_{A}\) - \(\tan\beta\) space are compared.

It is clear that the significance estimated as \(h/\Delta h\) coincides with the estimate from \(S/\sqrt{B}\) provided that the signal to background ratio is not deteriorated too much, ie for \(m_{A}\) not too close to \(m_{Z}\). In the region around \(m_{A}=m_{Z}\), where the signal to background ratio falls below 2 %, the \(S/\sqrt{B}\) prediction is more optimistic than the explicit fit result. A combined requirement that \(S/\sqrt{B}>5\) and that the signal is at least 2 % of the background gives rather good agreement with \(h/\Delta h>5\).

The number of signal events is a rather sensitive measure of \(\tan\beta\), but is prone to systematic errors due to uncertainties in the production cross sections and detection efficiencies. Given the discrepancies in the production cross sections of shower and ME approach, discussed in section 3, the peak height information has not been used in this study.

The signal extraction method discussed was designed specifically for the ex

traction of signals from a large background. For a smaller integrated luminosity, problems due to limited statistics may start to play a significant role. This should be kept in mind when evaluating the results. Figure 9 show the significance according to \(S/\sqrt{B}\) and as \(h/\delta h\) of a Gaussian fit to the signal.

On average, the agreement between both significance estimator is still rather good. Again, the prediction of \(S/\sqrt{B}\) is more optimistic than the fit result in

the regions where \(S/B<2\%\).

The uncertainty in the production rates has a considerable effect on the outcome of this study. Using the Matrix Element approach to calculate the \(gg\to A/hb\overline{b}\) (\(q\overline{q}\to A/hb\overline{b}\)) and \(gg\to Zb\overline{b}\) (\(q\overline{q}\to Zb\overline{b}\)) cross sections the predicted significance decreases, as shown in figures 10 and 11 for 300 and 30 \(fb^{-1}\), respectively. The minimum \(\tan\beta\) for a \(5\sigma\) discovery in the range \(105<m_{A}<125\) is raised to around 14 for 300 \(fb^{-1}\).

can provide a competitive measurement of the masses and width. In the mass range under study here the mass determination is complicated by the fact that two Higgs bosons contribute to the signal. Also, the extraction of the signal from the background could introduce systematic errors. The effect on the measurement of the Higgs mass is evaluated here by considering the difference between the simulated \(A^{0}\) mass and the fit result for the center of the Gaussian. No attempt is made to determine the mass if the significance of the signal is less than 5.

The result for 300 \(fb^{-1}\) is shown in figure 12. In a large fraction of the parameter space the center of the signal peak is found within 1 GeV of the simulated \(A^{0}\) mass. At low \(\tan\beta\) the area is limited by the requirement that the signal is significant. At high \(\tan\beta\) the error on the mass measurement increases around the \(Z^{0}\) mass. In this region the natural width of the Higgs bosons is quite large and the signal overlaps significantly with the center of the \(Z^{0}\) line shape. In this situation, both signals cannot easily be disentangled.

Provided the signal is significant and the signal does not overlap with the center of the \(Z^{0}\) peak, neither the signal extraction method nor the mass difference of \(h^{0}\) and \(A^{0}\) signals introduce significant systematic offsets in the mass measurement.

In nearly all of parameter space, the two Higgs bosons are indistinguishable, see figure 1. However, in the presence of other measurements a global fit of the MSSM parameters could well make use of the signal shape to improve the simultaneous determination of \(m_{A}\) and \(\tan\beta\). As the sensitivity to \(\tan\beta\) comes about through its relation to the natural width of the MSSM Higgs bosons - see figure 2 - it is limited to the region where the natural width is significantly larger than the mass resolution, ie \(\tan\beta>20\).

Conclusions

In a maximal mixing MSSM scenario with values of \(m_{A}\) below 125 GeV, the two lightest Higgs bosons - \(h^{0}\) and \(A^{0}\) - are nearly degenerate in mass. Due to the enhanced coupling to b-quarks at large \(\tan\beta\) the decay of both Higgs bosons to muons becomes interesting.

In this note, a first attempt to extract the signal from the overwhelming \(Z\) background is presented. Taking advantage of the similarity of a reference sample, large systematic deviations in the description of the background can be avoided. The significance found as the \(h/\delta h\) of a fit of the signal after signal extraction agrees with the conventional \(S/\sqrt{B}\) estimate provided the signal to background ratio does not become too low (\(S/B>2\%\)).

With an integrated luminosity of \(300fb^{-1}\) the combined h/A signal is observable only for enhanced Higgs to b-quark coupling, ie at large \(\tan\beta\). Using the shower approach predictions for the cross section, the combined \(h^{0}/A^{0}\) signal would yield a 5 \(\sigma\) discovery whenever \(m_{A}\) is in the range from 105 to 125 GeV and \(\tan\beta>10\). Calculating the cross sections in the Matrix Element approach the predicted minimum \(\tan\beta\) increases to 14. The signal would be discovered after tree years of low luminosity operation if the MSSM parameters are in the interval \(105<m_{A}<125\) and \(\tan\beta>18\) assuming the shower approach cross sections. Using the Matrix Element cross sections the prediction for the discovery region is much reduced: \(105<m_{A}<115\) and \(\tan\beta>30\).

If discovered, the excellent di-muon invariant mass resolution can contribute to precise measurement of \(m_{A}\). This channel is sensitive to the value of \(tg\beta\) for large values: \(tg\beta>20\).
