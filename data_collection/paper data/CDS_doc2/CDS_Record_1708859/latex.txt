###### Abstract

This document presents a study of the sensitivity of the ATLAS mono-jet search to pair production of WIMP Dark Matter with \(pp\) collision data at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV in 2015 and beyond. Two different classes of models are investigated: the Effective Field Theory employed in previous ATLAS mono-jet results and simplified models with an explicit light mediator. It is shown based on Monte Carlo simulations that the search will quickly surpass previous mono-jet limits within the first year of data-taking and its reach may be further doubled with respect to the first year of running when considering the full expected dataset from the High-Luminosity LHC corresponding to \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). Limitations of the Effective Field Theory approach are discussed in the context of the energies reached at the LHC.

Introduction

Searches for Weakly-Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) Dark Matter candidates are a well-established part of the physics programme at the LHC. With few clues about the physics that may connect the Standard Model to the dark sector, searches that are broadly sensitive to many types of WIMP pair production are a vital component of this programme. Among these, the search for events with a high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jet and large missing transverse momentum, referred to as the mono-jet search throughout this document, is both one of the most sensitive [1, 2, 3] and one of the most general, as it relies on initial state radiated jet(s) to tag the production of the invisible particles without making narrow assumptions about the nature of the mediating process.

Both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations have provided limits on WIMP pair production within an Effective Field Theory (EFT) approach [4, 5] where the SM-WIMP coupling is via a contact interaction. In this approach, the results from the LHC can be compared to the ones obtained in the direct and indirect Dark Matter detection experiments. The LHC has unique access to low-mass WIMP scenario and is complementary to other types of WIMP detection experiments. The use of EFTs at colliders must be approached carefully, given that the momentum transfer of the hard scattering probed at LHC energies may surpass the cut-off scales above which the EFT is invalid.

The LHC is undergoing its Phase 0 upgrade and will start delivering data at \(\sqrt{s}\) close to 14  with expected instantaneous luminosity \(\mathcal{L}=\)10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) and average number of interactions per bunch crossing \(\mu\) of about 30 in 2015. The increase of the centre-of-mass energy from 8  to 14  after the Phase 0 upgrade will result in increased sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model at the energy frontier.

This study aims to provide an early glimpse of the improved reach of the mono-jet analysis in 2015 and beyond. At present, many of the important inputs to such a study remain unknown or not completely determined. For example, the exact beam energy has not been decided, and not all aspects of the upgraded detector performance have been exhaustively studied. Thus, while this document represents a best effort to quantify the sensitivity of the mono-jet search using the best Monte Carlo simulations available at the time of the study, the results should be carefully regarded as only indicative of discovery and sensitivity prospects, since they depend on a number of experimental performance assumptions and analysis strategies that will only be realized in the future. This is all done under the condition that EFT is valid and the impact of varying this assumption will be quantified.

This note is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the simulation of the backgrounds and signals considered. Section 3 describes the mono-jet event selection used at 8, commenting on the differences with respect to the one used for the preliminary results from 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data by ATLAS [1]. Furthermore, possible modifications that will be necessary for the high pile-up scenarios at 14  are explained. A side-by-side comparison of predicted event yields at 8  and 14  is given in Sec. 4. The expected limits and discovery potential for dark matter with the EFT approach for a given precision in the SM background determination are presented in Sec. 5 under the rather strict assumption of the full validity of the EFT approach. Section 6 discusses the validity of the EFT approach at the LHC for 8  and 14  collisions. Finally, Sec. 7 presents the results in terms of \(s\)-channel simplified models for light mediators for governing the SM-WIMP interactions.

## 2 Simulation

For the Monte Carlo samples used in the 8 analysis, differing pile-up conditions throughout the 2012 data-taking are taken into account by overlaying simulated minimum-bias events generated with Pythia 8.165 [6] onto the hard-scattering process and reweighting them according to the observed \(\mu\) distribution in data. The Monte Carlo samples are then passed through a simulation [7] of the ATLASdetector and trigger, based on GEANT4 [8].

WIMP pair production events are generated in MadGraph 5.1.4.8 [9] using Pythia 6.426 [10] for parton showering and the CTEQ6L1 PDF [11] set. ATLAS and CMS typically investigate a Dark Matter mass range from 1 GeV to 1 TeV. For simplicity, this document focuses only on \(M_{\chi}=50\) GeV and 400  GeV in order to study the low and intermediate mass regimes, which are more relevant for colliders. Samples are produced with the interactions between quarks and Dirac fermion Dark Matter according to the Effective Field Theory operator D5 [4]. Corresponding simplified model samples with a vector mediator are produced for mediator masses ranging from 0.1 TeV to 15 TeV, and with two widths of \(\Gamma=M_{\rm med}/3\) and \(\Gamma=M_{\rm med}/8\pi\) chosen to match the original paper [5].

The Standard Model background to the mono-jet signature consists of electroweak processes resulting in a single boson (\(Z\to\nu\nu\)+jets, \(W\to l\nu\)+jets, \(Z\to ll\)+jets), \(t\bar{t}\) and single top processes, diboson processes, multi-jet processes and non-collision backgrounds. For the \(\sqrt{s}=8\)  TeV study, the electroweak processes are generated using Sherpa 1.4.1 [12] with the CT10 [13] parton distribution function (PDF) set. The \(t\bar{t}\) events and single top production in the \(s\)-channel are generated using MC@NLO 4.06 [14] with the CT10 PDF set, while the \(t\)-channel top events are provided by the AcerMC 3.8 [15] generator interfaced to Pythia 6.426 [10] with CTEQ6L1 [11] PDF set.

While the expected Standard Model background event yields at \(\sqrt{s}=8\)  TeV are taken directly from the Monte Carlo simulations, the \(\sqrt{s}=14\)  TeV background predictions involve substantial approximations intended to compensate for the lack of proper 14 TeV simulation for some processes at the time of the study. In particular, only \(W\to\tau\nu\)+jets, \(W\to\mu\nu\)+jets and \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds are simulated. Other sources of backgrounds are either emulated from the existing ones or omitted as explained in the following:

* Since the muon information is not used in the event selection at 14 TeV, as explained in Sec. 3, the \(Z\to\nu\nu\)+jets background estimate is taken from the \(W\to\mu\nu\)+jets simulation with the cross section adjusted accordingly.
* For the \(W\to e\nu\)+jets processes, \(W\to\mu\nu\)+jets simulation is scaled according to the relative contributions of these backgrounds observed at 8 TeV.
* The available \(t\bar{t}\) simulation is scaled up to account for the whole \(t\bar{t}\) and single top contribution based on the relative fractions of these backgrounds observed at 8 TeV.
* The \(Z\to ll\)+jets background enters the analysis when one or more of the leptons falls out of the selection acceptance or fails lepton identification criteria. At 8 TeV, this background represents an entirely negligible fraction of the total. It is assumed the future acceptance and performance of lepton identification remains similar to past performance, and thus this background can be neglected at 14 TeV as well.
* Full analyses of existing ATLAS data have shown that the multi-jet and non-collision background contributions can be reduced to a negligible level in the 8 TeV analysis. The selections employed to achieve this reduction are presently expected to provide similar performance in the 14 TeV data. Thus, in the 14 TeV study, these contributions are omitted.
* Diboson processes, although they contribute to the total background at 8 TeV at the \(\mathcal{O}\)(1%) level, are not considered at 14 TeV at all. The cross section for the diboson production is expected to grow with the centre-of-mass energy at a similar rate as in the case of the single boson processes [16] which justifies this approximation being made at 14 TeV.

For 14 TeV, pile-up conditions have been chosen according to a series of plausible experimental milestones. Approximately 25 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity is expected by the end of 2015. Although pile-upconditions \(\mu\) around 30 are expected in 2015, \(\mu=60\) is assumed in this study for simplicity as this value is expected for the further LHC upgrade phase. After the Phase 1 upgrade [17] in 2018, the instantaneous luminosity is expected to increase to around \(\mathcal{L}=\) 2\(\times\)10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). This will allow collection of approximately 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity by the end of 2022. A Phase 2 upgrade [18] is proposed to enable High-Luminosity LHC operation at an instantaneous luminosity \(\mathcal{L}=\) 5\(\times\)10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) that could deliver 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data with \(\mu=140\) by 2030. These pile-up conditions, summarized in Table 1, are implemented through smearing factors to the final state particle-level quantities derived from previous performance studies [19, 20]. The average \(\mu\) value at 8 TeV is obtained from the procedure described in Ref. [21] assuming the inelastic cross section of 73 mb.

## 3 Event Selection

The mono-jet analysis selection used here closely follows earlier ATLAS results [1]. It consists of general data quality requirements and a selection of a high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jet and missing transverse momentum, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). In terms of the WIMP pair production, this simple selection is based on the idea of detecting an initial state radiation jet, balanced by \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) in the opposite direction corresponding to the WIMP pair that leaves the detector unseen. Since there are no leptons at the parton level in such processes, a veto on electrons and muons is also imposed in order to suppress Standard Model background. Furthermore, at most two jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV and \(|\eta|<4.5\) are allowed in the final state. A cut on \(\Delta\phi\) between any selected jet and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) above 0.5 is imposed to suppress background from mis-reconstructed multi-jet events. This selection is adopted for the analysis presented here with the following changes.

The current study reports on a selection that is close to what was used for 8  TeV for a direct comparison of the sensitivity of the mono-jet searches at both centre-of-mass energies, even though a number of modifications to the selection are necessary to adapt to the 14  TeV collider, detector and simulation conditions. A reoptimization of the \(\sqrt{s}=8\)  TeV search strategy will certainly be desirable before 14  TeV data taking starts.

In the ATLAS 8 TeV data analysis [1] the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) trigger with an 80  GeV threshold is used, as it is the lowest \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) unprescaled trigger, and the leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) cuts are chosen to be above the trigger turn-on, at 120 GeV. Due to higher pile-up at 14 TeV, the thresholds for \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) triggers will have to be increased. Therefore, the lowest signal region for this study is defined with the leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>300\)  GeV and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>400\)  GeV. This choice is supported by the highest sensitivity to WIMP Dark Matter reached by higher \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) signal regions in the past mono-jet analyses. The choice of asymmetric cuts allows for extra jet radiation in the final states in addition to the first jet. Two additional signal regions are obtained by increasing the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) threshold to 600 and 800 GeV, while keeping the leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)  cut above 300 GeV.

The anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [22] with \(R=0.4\) is used for jet reconstruction. The missing transverse momentum is calculated from the vectorial sum of the hard reconstructed calorimeter-based objects

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c}  & \(\sqrt{s}\) [TeV] & \(\mu\) & \(L\) [fb\({}^{-1}\)] \\ \hline  & 8 & 20 & 20 \\ Phase 0 upgrade (2014-2015) & 14 & 60 & 25 \\ Phase 1 upgrade (2018) & 14 & 60 & 300 \\ Phase 2 upgrade (2022) & 14 & 140 & 3000 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}

(electrons, photons, taus, and jets), as well as calorimeter energy clusters within \(|\eta|<4.9\). Taus are calibrated at the jet energy scale, and muons are not considered in the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) computation.

The selection for the analysis at \(\sqrt{s}=14\)  focused not explicitly include data quality requirements. These are of crucial importance, as the mono-jet topology can easily be mimicked by noise or other sources of non-collision backgrounds such as beam-induced backgrounds [23]. Nevertheless, they are strongly dependent on the yet unknown collider and detector performance in data. It is therefore assumed that the inefficiency due to the jet identification cuts remains small and the relative systematic uncertainty is negligible with respect to other sources.

The lepton veto is emulated by applying the veto efficiency from the 8analysis. This is justified by upgrade performance studies [19, 20] that show that the lepton reconstruction efficiencies will be similar at 14.

Jets and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) in the 14  focused on Monte Carlo samples are reconstructed by applying smearing factors to the final state particle-level quantities reflecting the expected pile-up conditions [19, 20]. The smearing factors for jets are available only up to \(|\eta|\) of 3.6, as it is difficult to foresee the performance of the jet reconstruction in the forward region. Therefore, the jet object definition in the 14analysis is restricted to \(|\eta|<3.6\).

The jet definition \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold is increased from 30 to 50 in order to better suppress pile-up jets at higher luminosities [19]. Additional pile-up suppression techniques [24], involving tracking information, are being developed for \(\sqrt{s}=14\)analyses which may lead to smaller contamination by pile-up jets than at 8. The contamination due to pile-up jets is observed at the \(\mathcal{O}\)(1%) level in the 8 mono-jet analysis using the 30 yield \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold. With the 50 threshold at 14, lower or comparable pile-up jet contamination is expected.

Additional initial state parton emission, parton showering or pile-up jets lead to higher jet multiplicities. While arguing that the effect of pile-up is negligible, it remains to be seen how the jet multiplicity changes when increasing the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold from 30 to 50. The mono-jet analysis selection allows for up to two jets. However, the lower the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold, the more parton shower jets are expected. Therefore, with low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds the jet multiplicity requirement may be too restrictive. Figure 1 shows the jet multiplicities in \(Z\to\nu\nu+\)jets events at 8.5 passing the common event selection where the requirement on the number of jets is removed for two different jet definitions. The one used in the 8analysis, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\)  and \(|\eta|<4.5\), leads mostly to two-jet events whereas with the 14 definition, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>50\)  and \(|\eta|<3.6\), mono-jet events dominate. The figure also reveals that the 14 definition leads to approximately 30% higher \(Z\to\nu\nu+\)jets background. A similar increase is expected for signal.

This document does not aim to study the effect of different jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds on other background processes, nor to optimize the signal sensitivity in terms of the jet definition. The 8 selection is chosen such that it is close to the one used for the actual data analysis and the same is attempted for the future 14data analysis. Therefore, the two different jet definitions used in this study should not be considered as an inconsistency. For completeness, Fig. 1 also compares the jet multiplicity at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) and \(\sqrt{s}=14\)  focused with the same threshold of 50 for both cases. The two distributions are compatible indicating that the large increase in centre-of-mass energy does not lead to qualitatively different topologies in terms of jet multiplicity.

The selection criteria for the 8 and 14analysis are summarized in Table 2.

## 4 Expected Event Yields

Table 3 lists some example event counts obtained by applying the selection described in the previous section. Signal expectations are provided for Dark Matter masses of \(50\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(400\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The expectations for the dominant \(Z\to\nu\nu\)+jets background are also provided. These estimates correspond to \(20\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of data recorded at \(\sqrt{s}=8\,\,\mathrm{TeV}\) and \(14\,\,\mathrm{TeV}\). For the latter centre-of-mass energy, the table provides estimates for two average numbers of interactions per bunch crossing, \(\mu=60\) and \(\mu=140\).

The number of predicted background events is larger for \(\mu=140\) than for \(\mu=60\). This can be explained by the worse energy resolution in the presence of increased pile-up. Larger smearing of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and the fact that the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distribution is exponentially falling result in more events from below the analysis cut values entering the signal regions. The table also shows that harder interactions lead to harder \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) tails, as expected. This is also confirmed by the higher fraction of events at high \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) at \(14\,\mathrm{TeV}\) than at \(8\,\mathrm{TeV}\) in Fig. 2. The change being more significant for signal than for \(Z\to\nu\nu\)+jets background indicates a better sensitivity to new physics at higher \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) in an upgraded LHC scenario. The harder MET spectra for signal compared to the \(Z\to\nu\nu\)+jets background come from the higher mass scale of the interactions. For a fixed \(\sqrt{s}\), increasing the mediator mass from the \(Z\) mass to the contact

As already stated in Sec. 2, the multi-jet and non-collision backgrounds are neglected in this study. The \(Z\to ll\)+jets and diboson processes that are omitted at 14 TeV are still shown in the 8 TeV distribution in order to visualize the approximations made at 14 TeV.

## 5 Sensitivity to WIMP Dark Matter in the Effective Field Theory

The gain in the sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model related to the increase of the centre-of-mass energy from \(8\,\mathrm{TeV}\) to \(14\,\mathrm{TeV}\) depends on various factors such as the magnitude of systematic uncertainties and the amount of Standard Model backgrounds. For the Effective Field Theory Dark Matter operators, ATLAS and CMS have published limits on the suppression scale \(M^{*}\) as a function of Dark Matter mass \(M_{X}\)[1, 2, 3, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31].

The EFT provides a simple framework to describe WIMP pair production in terms of a contact interaction [4], which is the limiting form of a \(2\to 2\) body process where the mediator mass, \(M_{\mathrm{med}}\), is much heavier that the typical scale of the interaction \(Q_{\mathrm{tr}}\). For the mono-jet analysis, \(Q_{\mathrm{tr}}\) refers to the invariant mass of the two DM particles created by the hard process, equivalent to the invariant mass of the two partons entering the hard process after the initial state radiation. The suppression scale \(M^{*}\) in the EFT corresponds to \(M_{\mathrm{med}}/\sqrt{g_{\mathrm{SM}}g_{\mathrm{DM}}}\), where \(g_{\mathrm{SM}}\) and \(g_{\mathrm{DM}}\) are the couplings of the mediator to Standard Model and Dark Matter particles, respectively.

The degree to which the EFT approach is valid, given that LHC energies could provide momentum transfer high enough to directly probe the mediator mass, will be discussed in detail in Sec. 6. For the purpose of comparison with previous results, the assumption that \(\pi<\sqrt{g_{\mathrm{SM}}g_{\mathrm{DM}}}\leq 4\pi\) is made in this section, allowing the EFT to remain a good approximation at the LHC energies.

The improvement in sensitivity with the new LHC data is determined corresponding to the following milestones in terms of data-taking conditions:

* \(L=5\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) corresponding to the first month(s) of the LHC operation in 2015,
* \(L=25\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) the expected amount of acquired data within the first year after the Phase 0 upgrade,
* \(L=300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) at the end of Phase 1 data-taking,
* \(L=3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) as expected from the High-Luminosity LHC in Phase 2.

All limits on the suppression scale \(M^{*}\) in this document are based on simulation only, both at 8 and at 14 TeV. The \(CL_{s}\) modified frequentist approach [32] is used considering systematic uncertainties on the Standard Model backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties on the signal are neglected. The uncertainty on the luminosity measurement is not taken into account for background, since the mono-jet analysis employs a data-driven technique to estimate the dominant Standard Model backgrounds where this source

The \(Z\to ll+\)jets and diboson processes are not shown for \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{\,TeV}\). Pile-up conditions \(\mu=140\) are assumed at \(14\,\mathrm{TeV}\).

of uncertainty cancels. Changing the nominal expected background event yield at the \(\mathcal{O}(1\%)\) level, as could be expected due to missing diboson samples, was seen to result in sub percent-level differences in the limits.

In order to separate the effect on the increase of the sensitivity due to higher centre-of-mass energy from the impact of accumulating more data, we first compare the derived limits on the suppression scale \(M^{*}\), estimated at the 95% confidence level (CL), with a similar amount of data at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV and 14 TeV, assuming a 5% total uncertainty on Standard Model background. This is a relatively safe assumption, as this level of understanding of the background is already met in previous mono-jet searches. Figure 4 shows the \(M^{*}\) limits at both centre-of-mass energies for the three signal regions. The increase of the centre-of-mass energy leads to stronger limits on \(M^{*}\) by more than a factor of 2.

In order to see the effect of accumulating more data, Fig. 5 compares the \(M^{*}\) limits for the milestones of integrated luminosity defined above. The figures stress the importance of high \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) signal regions, as significant improvements in the limits are observed as a function of time. There is almost 50% improvement in the limits from \(5\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) and \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) at high \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). No such increase in sensitivity is observed at low \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) with the addition of further data in the 5% background systematic uncertainty scenario. This is attributed to the large Standard Model backgrounds. For the later stages of data-taking, an additional scenario with only 1% total uncertainty on background is considered. This is a challenging goal, plausible only under sustained performance improvements in the future. With this ultimate 1% uncertainty further improvements in the limits can be expected. Beyond the Phase 2 upgrade, further improvements in the limits on \(M^{*}\) with the full HL-LHC dataset are only visible at high \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\).

The impact of both effects on the sensitivity to new physics, namely the increase in centre-of-mass energy and higher data statistics, are summarized in Fig. 6. The \(M^{*}\) limits with \(5\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) at \(14\,\mathrm{TeV}\) are already almost twice as stringent as the ones obtained with the full \(8\,\mathrm{TeV}\) dataset. Therefore, according

Figure 4: The 95% CL lower limits on the suppression scale \(M^{*}\) from \(20\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=8\)  TeV, equivalent to the full dataset, and \(25\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=14\)  TeV, corresponding to one year of data-taking. The limits for the D5 operators with \(M_{\chi}=50\) and \(400\)  GeV are shown for three signal regions defined by \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>400\), \(600\) and \(800\)  GeV, considering 5% systematic uncertainty on Standard Model background. The \(8\,\mathrm{TeV}\) limits presented are based on simulation only. These results assume that the EFT is a valid approach. The discussion of EFT validity is deferred to Sec. 6.

to these preliminary estimates, the first moments after the Phase 0 upgrade will already be extremely important and the first data delivered early in 2015 may already be sufficient to test the eventual presence of new physics, provided the upgraded detector will be understood promptly in terms of systematic uncertainties. Accumulating \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of data by 2030 and pushing down the systematics to 1% may shift the \(M^{*}\) limits by another factor of 2, when comparing with the first \(5\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) and a 5% systematic. The \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) limit comes from the highest \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) region considered in this study, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>800\,\mathrm{\ Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\). Higher \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) regions are likely to bring further sensitivity.

The improvement in the exclusion limits is not the only benchmark for evaluating the sensitivity of the analysis at 14 TeV. If Dark Matter is within the reach of the LHC, it is useful to know how much data is needed for a 5\(\sigma\) discovery. Once again, it should be stressed that the following results assume specific values for the SM-DM couplings (\(\pi<\sqrt{g_{\mathrm{SM}}g_{\mathrm{DM}}}\leq 4\pi\)) so that, in principle, the EFT approach can be considered valid. This set of coupling values has been confirmed to result in a valid EFT for the full range of \(M^{*}\) considered in the following discovery potential studies.

The limits are shown for the D5 operators with \(M_{\chi}=50\,\mathrm{\ Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) (left) and 400 (right).

(\(L=300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\)) and with the complete expected dataset from HL-LHC (\(L=3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\)). Considering a 5% systematic uncertainty on the background estimation, the LHC could detect a signal within the EFT framework with \(M^{*}\) up to 1500 \(\,\mathrm{GeV}\) at \(5\sigma\) after one year of data-taking. The reach of the LHC with \(L=300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) could grow up to \(M^{*}\) values of 1800 \(\,\mathrm{GeV}\) at \(5\sigma\) with the same background systematic uncertainty. No further improvement in the discovery potential is observed for HL-LHC, considering only the three defined \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) selections, unless the systematic uncertainties are further reduced. Taking into account the ultimate precision on the Standard Model background determination (1% total systematic error), the reach extends to \(M^{*}\sim 2200\,\mathrm{GeV}\) with \(L=300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) and \(M^{*}\sim 2600\,\mathrm{GeV}\) for HL-LHC for a \(5\sigma\) discovery.

As already mentioned, the results presented in this section assume the EFT approach is strictly valid in the phase space covered by the LHC collisions. This is not always a justified assumption, as discussed in the following section.

These results assume that the EFT is a valid approach. The discussion of EFT validity is deferred to Sec. 6.

## 6 Validity of the Effective Field Theory

All the limits in the previous section were presented under the assumption that the EFT is fully valid at the LHC energy scale. Studies on the validity of the EFT and the corresponding impact on the quoted limits have been presented in Ref. [33, 34, 35], which argue that the minimum validity constraint for the EFT is to require \(Q_{\rm tr}<M_{\rm med}\). Note that the EFT is instead parametrized in terms of the suppression scale \(M^{*}\), which is related to the mediator mass and couplings via \(M^{*}=M_{\rm med}/\sqrt{g_{\rm SM}g_{\rm DM}}\). This leads to the requirement of \(Q_{\rm tr}<\sqrt{g_{\rm SM}g_{\rm DM}}M^{*}\), where it is common to make the assumption of \(g_{\rm SM}=g_{\rm DM}=1\) and \(g_{\rm SM}=g_{\rm DM}=4\pi\) is the maximum allowed value in order to stay in the perturbative domain. This study presents a scan over the coupling product \(\sqrt{g_{\rm SM}g_{\rm DM}}\), including the case of \(g_{\rm SM}=g_{\rm DM}=1\), in order to study the evolution of the validity for the EFT operator D5.

The validity of the EFT can be addressed through the following two procedures. They both remove events failing the validity criteria where \(Q_{\rm tr}>M_{\rm med}=\sqrt{g_{\rm SM}g_{\rm DM}}M^{*}\) and define the fraction of valid events \(R^{\rm tot}_{M_{\rm med}}\). One of the methods is based on truncating the phase space and scanning over \(M^{*}\):

1. Scan over \(M^{*}\) and determine \(R^{\rm tot}_{M_{\rm med}}\) for each value of \(M^{*}\).
2. Rescale the original cross section of the signal sample, \(\sigma_{\rm full}(M^{*})\), so that it corresponds only to the

Figure 7: Discovery potential for Dark Matter signal with D5 operator and \(M_{\chi}=50\) GeV with \(25\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) (top left), \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) (top right) and \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) (bottom) data. These results assume that the EFT is a valid approach. The discussion of EFT validity is deferred to Sec. 6.

valid events: \(\sigma_{\rm valid}(M^{*})=\sigma_{\rm full}(M^{*})\cdot R_{M_{\rm mol}}^{\rm tot}( M^{*})\).
3. Determine the point where \(\sigma_{\rm valid}(M^{*})\) and the experimental limit on the visible cross section meet and take the corresponding \(M^{*}\) value as the resulting final limit on the suppression scale \(M^{*}{}_{\rm valid}\).

Alternatively, an iterative method along the lines of Ref. [34] can be used:

1. Start with the nominal expected limit on \(M^{*}\) assuming 100% validity, named \(M^{*}{}_{\rm exp}\).
2. For each step \(i\), obtain the relative fraction of valid events \(R_{M_{\rm mol}}^{i}\) satisfying \(Q_{\rm tr}<\sqrt{g_{\rm SM}g_{\rm DM}}M^{*}{}_{\rm in}\) with respect to all events passing the previous iteration, where \(M^{*}{}_{\rm in}\) is the suppression scale limit obtained in the previous step.
3. Rescale \(M^{*}\) following Ref. [34], noting that D5 is a dimension 6 operator: \(M^{*}{}_{\rm out}=\left[R_{M_{\rm mol}}^{i}\right]^{1/4}M^{*}{}_{\rm in}\).
4. Go to step 2, using the current \(M^{*}{}_{\rm out}\) as the new \(M^{*}{}_{\rm in}\), repeating until the fraction of valid events at a given step \(R_{M_{\rm mol}}^{i}\) reaches 0 or 1.
5. Calculate the total validity fraction \(R_{M_{\rm mol}}^{\rm tot}=\prod_{i}R_{M_{\rm mol}}^{i}\) and the final rescaled limit on the suppression scale \(M^{*}{}_{\rm valid}=\left[R_{M_{\rm mol}}^{\rm tot}\right]^{1/4}M^{*}{}_{\rm exp}\).

Both methods have been shown to produce equivalent results. The latter one is used in this document.

The specific values of \(M^{*}{}_{\rm exp}\) used in these studies come from 20 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data at 8 TeV and 25 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data at 14 TeV, both under the assumption of a flat 5% systematic uncertainty. These correspond to the delivered 8 TeV luminosity and the expected first year of 14 TeV luminosity. The limit on \(M^{*}{}_{\rm exp}\) corresponding to each signal region is used for the corresponding \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) cut, and is listed in Table 4.

Figures 8 and 9 demonstrate the impact of changing the value of \(\sqrt{g_{\rm SM}g_{\rm DM}}\) on the validity of the EFT as a function of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) for \(M_{\chi}=50\) GeV and \(M_{\chi}=400\) GeV, respectively. Under the assumption of \(g_{\rm SM}=g_{\rm DM}=1\), the fraction of valid events for both \(M_{\chi}=50\) GeV and \(M_{\chi}=400\) GeV is zero or very close to zero at 8 TeV, meaning that the EFT is not valid for this choice of couplings. However, the phase space at \(\sqrt{s}=14\)  TeV is much less constrained, and the \(M_{\chi}=50\)  GeV point in particular leads to \(\sim\)40% valid events for all three \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) cuts. In addition, it appears that the assumption of \(\sqrt{g_{\rm SM}g_{\rm DM}}=1\) is an uncharacteristically restrictive scenario, and small increases in the coupling strengths lead to fractions of valid events quickly approaching 100%. As the figures show, there is no need to go to the maximum perturbative coupling limit of \(\sqrt{g_{\rm SM}g_{\rm DM}}=4\pi\) for the EFT to be completely valid, and in fact all of the scenarios considered are valid by \(\sqrt{g_{\rm SM}g_{\rm DM}}\sim\pi\) or earlier. Thus, while some regions of the parameter space are clearly invalid, there are still interesting regions where the EFT approach is fully justified.

The change in the validity fraction observed in these figures when comparing 8 TeV and 14 TeV for a fixed DM mass and coupling strength is due to multiple competing effects. For a given \(M^{*}\) value, the fraction of valid events is smaller at higher \(\sqrt{s}\). This is expected, as increasing the centre-of-mass energy naturally increases the average momentum transfer, and thus the validity fraction decreases as more events enter the UV regime. However, this is balanced by the large increase in the limit on the visible cross section, leading to improved limits on the Dark Matter suppression scale \(M^{*}{}_{\rm exp}\). Given that the scheme used for determining EFT validity relies on either the visible cross section or the resulting limit \(M^{*}{}_{\rm exp}\), the final result is an increase in validity. This is an important distinction, and would not be the case if the EFT validity was in comparison to a fixed scale of absolute value.

One other constraint to consider is the effect of the Dark Matter mass on the validity fraction, since \(M_{\chi}\) and \(Q_{\rm tr}\) are not independent quantities. There is a strong requirement of \(2M_{\chi}\leq Q_{\rm tr}\leq\sqrt{g_{\rm SM}g_{\rm DM}}M^{*}\) in order to produce the final Dark Matter particles. This can be clearly seen in Fig. 9, where the expected 8 TeV limit is 840 GeV for \(M_{\chi}=400\)  GeV, rendering the model invalid until much larger values of the coupling than observed for \(M_{\chi}=50\,\GeV\). The corresponding \(14\,\TeV\) plot is instead valid for a much larger coupling range, but still less than for the lighter Dark Matter of \(M_{\chi}=50\,\GeV\). This demonstrates the trend where increasing the Dark Matter mass results in a smaller validity fraction.

These validity fractions can then be turned into rescaled limits. Following the procedure defined above, where \(M^{*}_{\rm valid}=\left[R_{M_{\rm med}}^{\rm tot}\right]^{1/4}M^{*}_{\rm exp}\), one obtains the results seen in Fig. 10 for \(M_{\chi}=50\,\GeV\) and Fig. 11 for \(M_{\chi}=400\,\GeV\). The values of the rescaled limits for a few specific choices of couplings are listed explicitly in Table 4. Due to the validity fraction being raised to the power of \(\frac{1}{4}\), the rescaled limit quickly approaches the nominal limit so long as \(R_{M_{\rm med}}^{\rm tot}\neq 0\). For all scenarios considered, this results in rescaled limits at the level of the nominal limit well before \(\sqrt{g_{\rm SM}g_{\rm DM}}=\pi\).

Limits generally increase with higher \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) cuts, until statistics becomes the dominant limitation, but higher \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) also comes with higher average \(Q_{\rm tr}\). These two effects must both be considered, and the interplay between the two is clear in Fig. 8. At \(8\,\TeV\) and for \(\sqrt{g_{\rm SM}g_{\rm DM}}\leq 1.4\), there is a region where the

A scan over different values of couplings \(\sqrt{g_{\rm SM}g_{\rm DM}}\) for three \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) thresholds is shown. Each \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) threshold uses the associated nominal limit \(M^{*}_{\rm exp}\) for the threshold in question.

A scan over different values of couplings \(\sqrt{g_{\rm SM}g_{\rm DM}}\) for three \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) thresholds is shown.

selection with larger \(M^{*}_{\rm\,exp}\) (\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>600\,\) GeV) has a lower validity fraction than a selection with a lower threshold (\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>400\,\) GeV). Above 1.4, the increased \(M^{*}_{\rm\,exp}\) again dominates, leading to an improved \(R_{M_{\rm med}}^{\rm tot}\). Figure 10 also shows how the impact of the validity fraction is reduced when considering the full limit rescaling procedure. Starting from a higher \(M^{*}_{\rm\,exp}\) provides a linear dependence, while the validity fraction only enters under a power of \(\frac{1}{4}\) for the D5 operator. As such, the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) cut of \(600\,\)GeV still provides the strongest rescaled limit for \(\sqrt{g_{\rm SM}g_{\rm DM}}\geq 1.1\) among the three considered signal regions, despite only having a higher validity fraction from 1.4.

It is also important to consider how these conclusions will change for each of the typical EFT operators. Comparing the observed limits for different operators from the 7 ATLAS mono-jet result [2] shows that D5 is one of the operators with stronger limits on \(M^{*}\), and thus will have a larger validity

[34]. Three different coupling assumptions are provided for all three \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) thresholds considered. All numbers are given with a precision of two significant digits.

Simplified Models

Given the issues with the validity of the EFT, a reasonable step forward is to move toward the use of simplified models, where the mediator is no longer integrated out. This naturally addresses the question of validity at high \(Q_{\mathrm{tr}}\). This scenario is parametrized by a mediator mass \(M_{\mathrm{med}}\) and two mediator couplings \(g_{\mathrm{SM}}\) and \(g_{\mathrm{DM}}\). These parameters are related to the EFT suppression scale via \(M^{*}=\frac{M_{\mathrm{med}}}{\sqrt{g_{\mathrm{SM}}g_{\mathrm{DM}}}}\). Note that the couplings must exist and remain perturbative, but there is no way to set a lower bound without knowledge of the full UV-complete theory, which implies a validity requirement of \(0<g_{\mathrm{SM}},g_{\mathrm{DM}}\leq 4\pi\).

One such simplified model is \(Z^{\prime}\), in which two quarks in the initial state couple to a vector mediator \(Z^{\prime}\) via \(g_{\mathrm{SM}}\) (whether virtual or on-shell), which then decays to two DM particles via \(g_{\mathrm{DM}}\). Such samples for various mediator masses \(M_{\mathrm{med}}\) and two mediator widths \(\Gamma=M_{\mathrm{med}}/3\) and \(\Gamma=M_{\mathrm{med}}/8\pi\) are studied again for \(M_{\chi}=50\,\) GeV and \(M_{\chi}=400\,\) GeV.

An interesting use of simplified models is to study the transition between production domains. For very low mediator masses, the high \(Q_{\mathrm{tr}}\) results in off-shell production. At medium to high mediator masses, the resonant production regime is accessed, leading to a large cross section boost and corresponding strong limits. At the highest masses, the mediator is no longer within the energy reach of the collider and the production can be described as a contact interaction, analogous to the effective field theory picture. These three domains are clearly visible in Fig. 12, where the limits from the EFT are also shown for comparison. This demonstrates the conservative nature of EFT limits for all but the lowest mediator masses, where off-shell production dominates.

The two plots in Fig. 12 show the effect of changing the collision energy. When the average momentum transfer increases, the mediator mass which provides the strongest limit shifts up. Moving from low to high \(M_{\mathrm{med}}\), the class of interaction switches from off-shell production to resonant production to contact interactions. The strong limits from enhanced cross-sections are visible as a peaked structure at the \(\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TeV})\) range, where the exact location of the peak changes from \(\sim 1\,\) TeV to \(\sim 2\,\) TeV when going from \(\sqrt{s}\) of \(8\,\)TeV to \(14\,\)TeV. Limits generally increase by a factor of 1.5 to 3, depending on the mediator mass, when increasing the collision energy. This is consistent with the improvements in the EFT bounds shown in Fig. 4.

Figure 13 is an alternate portrayal of the same information. It demonstrates exactly where the simplified model breaks down due to non-perturbative couplings. Unlike in EFT, the validity constraints are very clear for simplified models. The non-perturbative region corresponds to phase space where the limits are too weak to say anything. When comparing the \(8\,\)TeV to \(14\,\)TeV results within the subfigures of Fig. 13, the limits become much stronger at \(14\,\)TeV as already discussed and therefore a larger portion of phase space is within the perturbative regime.

Corresponding limits from EFT models are shown on the same plot as green dashed lines to show equivalence between the two models for high mediator masses.

Conclusion

The Monte Carlo study presented in this note highlights the importance of the first \(pp\) collision data at \(\sqrt{s}=14\)  TeV for searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.

In terms of Dark Matter production in the mono-jet topology, under the assumption of full EFT validity, the exclusion limits on the suppression scale are almost doubled from the first 5 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data after the Phase 0 upgrade. Further improvements are foreseen for future datasets and conditions.

Even though the EFT remains a useful benchmark approach due to its simplicity, its limitations have to be carefully considered and clearly stated when employed for LHC results. This study considers the dependence of the EFT validity on couplings, adopting the requirement \(Q_{\mathrm{tr}}<\sqrt{g_{\mathrm{SM}}g_{\mathrm{DM}}}M^{*}\). It is shown that the commonly used assumption on the coupling strengths \(g_{\mathrm{SM}}=g_{\mathrm{DM}}=1\) renders the majority of the events in the mono-jet signal region invalid. The EFT validity issue can be resolved by using simplified models, such as a \(Z^{\prime}\) light mediator. The increased sensitivity of the search at the 14 TeV LHC observed with the EFT approach is confirmed when switching to simplified models.
