## Abstract

The comparative study of neutron shielding based on boron and lithium is presented. The absorption of neutrons in both cases is shown to be similar, while the substantial advantage of the lithium based shielding with respect to the gamma-rays emission is demonstrated.

The proposed shielding against fast neutrons inside the ATLAS apparatus is based on borated polyethylene (BPE). Hydrogen contained in polyethylene (PE) is responsible for neutron slowing down while boron is added to capture slowed neutrons. This prevents transport of neutrons and their radiative capture in surrounding material (e.g. in Fe, Cu, Si) or in PE itself (mainly due to the \({}^{1}H(n,\gamma)\) reaction, \(E_{\gamma}=2224\)\(keV\)), thus suppressing significantly the background. The disadvantage of boron based shield comes from the gamma-ray production in the reaction \({}^{10}B(n,\alpha)^{7}Li^{*}\), \(E_{\gamma}=478\)\(keV\), which is the main channel responsible for neutron capture.

To avoid this disadvantage it is suggested to use as a neutron shield lithium doped polyethylene (LiPE), where the reaction responsible for the neutron capture is \({}^{6}Li(n,\alpha)^{3}H\) with no gamma-ray production. To check this idea, experiments have been carried out in which shielding efficiencies of PE, BPE, water, water solution of boric acid, and water with dissolved lithium nitrate were investigated. Experimental setups with a \({}^{252}Cf\) neutron source (\(2.5\times 10^{6}\)\(s^{-1}\) total neutron emission), HPGe gamma-ray detector and slow neutron detector are shown in Fig. 1 (8 \(cm\) thick shielding layer of PE bricks or BPE bricks between source and detector) and Fig. 2 (source in the middle of a polyethylene bottle filled with water or a solution).

Spectra of gamma-rays produced inside the shield and slow neutron flux behind the shield have been measured. Examples of relevant parts of gamma-ray spectra are shown in Fig. 3. The gamma-ray detection efficiency for 478 \(keV\) boron line is about 2-times higher than for 2224 \(keV\) hydrogen line. The results are summarized in Tab. 1, Tab. 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4.

Tab. 2 and Fig. 4 demonstrate that both shields, with boron (1%) and with lithium (4.5%), have similar efficiency for the neutron absorption. From Fig. 3 one can see that the boron based shield substantially suppresses the hydrogen line (2224 _keV_) in gamma-ray spectrum but at the price of photon (478 _keV_) production from neutron capture in boron. Obviously, in the case of lithium shield the boron line is absent and at the same time, shield with 4.5% of lithium provides the same suppression of hydrogen line (see Fig. 4b).

In view of this test it is proposed to take into account above discussed advantages of lithium based neutron shielding (e.g. _Li\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)_, _LiF_ or _LiH_ filled PE) in the ATLAS apparatus design.
