###### Abstract

We have measured the distribution in wire position with respect to the center of the tube as defined by the cradle in which the tube is held using X-ray images. A dental X-ray system and dental film was used in the measurements. The end plugs were provided by the Pavia group. The projected wire position in each of two orthogonal views was found to fit a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of \(18.6\pm 1.5\) microns.

**Introduction**

To achieve the desired position accuracy of the MDT chambers all contributions to the error must be kept as small as reasonably possible. Although it is in principle possible to X-ray the positions of all the wires in an MDT chamber and correct the track hit positions accordingly, it is clearly desirable to keep the wire position uncertainties below the level at which they contribute significantly to the hit measurement error.

This study investigates the cumulated errors due to how well the wire locator centers the wire with respect to its perimeter, how well the locator itself centers within the tube during swaging and finally how well the tube centers on the positioning cradle. At least part of these contributions can be calculated under certain assumptions, although the assumptions are certainly subject to challenge or a refined interpretation.

Let us assume that the hole in the locator is larger in radius than the wire by \(\rm l_{h}\). Further let us assume that the wire is held randomly within the hole by fuzz left over from drilling the hole. Then the projected rms error from this source is \(\rm l_{h}/2\). If the alignment hole itself is not centered on the alignment disk by a distance \(\rm l_{c}\) then the projected rms contribution from this displacement is \(\rm l_{c}/\sqrt{2}\). If the alignment disk radius is smaller than the tube inner radius by an amount that ranges randomly from \(\rm l_{i}\) to \(\rm l_{o}\) then the projected rms contribution is given by \(\sqrt{\rm l_{i}^{2}+\rm l_{o}^{2}}/2\). It should be noted that opposite end errors from this last contribution might be highly correlated since gravity might align the locator offsets in the same direction. If gravity determines the direction of the offset, then this contribution could be

The proportional tube rests in three cradles laid out on the laboratory floor. The cradles were aligned and leveled to about 100 microns. The end of the tube under the X-ray overlaps the cradle about 4.5 cm because we used only about a 600 gm weight to hold the tube in the cradle. This amount of weight was not sufficient to straighten a slightly bent tube so that the alignment section could be certain to rest in the cradle. Hence we reduced the overlap with the cradle to reduce this source of error. The weight has a slot in it as indicated in the schematic to allow the x-rays to pass. There is a 600 micron slot in the bottom of the cradle beneath the X-ray tube to allow the X-rays to pass to the film. The film compartment is offset with respect to this slot so that by rotating the film 180\({}^{\circ}\) two exposures could be put on one film. Each end of a tube was X-rayed in two orthogonal views that were contained on a single film.

### Measurements

The measurements of the X-ray films was done on a _Smartscope_ manufactured by Optical Gauging, Inc. of Rochester New York. The scope accuracy is better than 1 micron and the measurement of the wire position is better than 5 microns as determined by repeated measurements of the same wire. Fig. 1 shows the computer screen image from the _Smartscope_ of the slot and wire. The image is made under full zoom although no significant improvement in accuracy was achieved using this full zoom mode. The alignment disk shows up as the light band at the bottom of the figure and the sides of the slot define the dark area in which the 50 micron wire is observed. The film is rotated by hand to align the wire along the y-axis. A region 1.2 mm long starting 0.1 mm from the edge of the alignment disk is the fiducial region used for the measurements. A variable width box target is used to measure the center of the slot and the center of the wire. By adjusting the box width appropriately, the box target allows the measurement to be done on both sides of the slot simultaneously. Similarly both edges of the wire are measured simultaneously. The difference of these two measurements gives the wire location with respect to the slot. The slot was off center with respect to the cradle by 89 microns and parallax from the X-ray tube, wire and slot alignment adds an additional _a priori_ unknown instrumental offset.

After X-ray images from about 60 tubes were taken, it was found that the X-ray tube alignment could be rather easily changed by a bump on the X-ray tube by the operator's head. An alignment change modifies the parallax correction and results in a shift in the mean wire position. Such bumps occurred several times during the data taking due to the close proximity of the film and the X-ray tube. We have no method of detecting small changes after the fact, but large changes are noted by the observance of a large shift in the mean wire position. We have broken the data into four groups corresponding to such large alignment shifts. The first group corresponds to 30 tubes or 120 measurements and each of the other three groups contain about 10 tubes. Following the exposures of the first group, the X-ray head was adjusted again so this is a reasonable termination for that group. Also at the beginning of the first group we checked the instrumental offset by measuring the tube at an arbitrary \(0^{\circ}\) and then again a \(180^{\circ}\) from that angle. The offset can then be calculated by averaging the two wire displacements. We did this seven times for an average of \(53.2\pm 2.5\) microns. This is purely an instrumental offset and is not at all related to the positioning of the wire in the tube. We present the results for the first large group although the other three groups give similar results.

Figure 2 shows the distribution in wire position from the 120 measurements taken on 30 tubes. Except for three high data points, the distribution is fitted nicely by a Gaussian. The interesting number is the width of the distribution. The Gaussian fit gave a wire distribution having a standard deviation of \(18.6\pm 1.5\) microns.

The center of the distribution is at 50.6 microns which agrees well with the purely instrumental offset of 52.3 microns found by direct measurement at the beginning of the sequence. The rotational orientation of the tube is chosen randomly for the wire position measurements so that the instrumental offset is due entirely to the parallax and the offset of the slot. If there were a systematic offset in the wire alignment within the tube the offset would only contribute to the width of the distribution as discussed above.

The origin of the three high points is unknown if they are other than a statistical fluke. The three points occurred in the first 26 measurements and may have been due to a learning curve concerning proper seating of the tube in the cradle.

The offsets of the other three groups each containing about one third the data of the first group were 108.7 microns, 34.5 microns and 42.4 microns. The corresponding rms widths were 19.2 microns, 19.0 microns and 14.0 microns.

Summary

We have used a dental X-ray system to measure the wire position of a sample of tubes made at the University of Washington using the Pavia end plug assemblies. The distribution appears to be well contained within a standard deviation of 20 microns. It is speculated that if the wire locator is undersize, it may be profitable to record the direction of gravity on the tube at the time of swaging the end plug so the tube could be placed with this direction approximately perpendicular to the MDT chamber.
