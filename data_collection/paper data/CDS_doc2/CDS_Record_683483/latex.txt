The Tile-Calorimeter consists of a cylinder constructed of steel plates that are trapezoidal in shape and formed into wedge shaped structures that are 2250 mm at their inner radius and 4200 mm at their outer radius. Each wedge module in the barrel is constructed of 5 or 6 approximately 1 meter long modules. The extended barrel consists of two 1 meter long modules that form a similar cylinder that extends from each end of the barrel. The barrel cylinder is approximately 5990 mm long, and each of the extended barrel cylinders is approximately 2700 mm each. Each cell in the construction consists of two long trapezoidal plates 5 mm thick. A series of shorter plates 4 mm thick are staggered in between to form a checkerboard pattern when assembled. Each module is stacked with approximately 325 cells arrayed along the barrel axis. The total weight of the steel plates in the detector is approximately 2000 metric tons.

### Organization

The U.S. participation in the Atlas Collaboration will require that some portion of the steel for the Tile-Calorimeter, and its subsequent fabrication into the appropriate shapes, plus the assembly into the prescribed modules be carried out by institutions in the U.S. At the present time the U.S. institutions responsible for this effort are: Argonne National Laboratory, the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois, Harvard University, Brandeis University, and Michigan State University.

### Technical Specification

The punched steel plates that will be used to construct the calorimeter described above, have applied tolerancing that is more stringent than is normally encountered for these manufacturing processes. It is therefore incumbent on the fabricator to understand the tolerancing and its effect on the overall assembly. The tolerancing for the location of the holes, slots, and plate dimensions are identified on the applicable drawings.

**Material**

The material to be used for fabricating these plates is identified in the material specification, ANL-HEP-TR-94-48. The general description of the plates is that of hot rolled, pickled, and annealed steel. Additional cold reduction may be used to achieve the required thickness tolerance. This additional reduction is at the discretion of the supplier and is not required if the thickness tolerances can be achieved without it. It will be the responsibility of the fabricator to procure the necessary material, and inspect to assure compliance with the aforementioned material specification. The raw plate sizes will be determined by the fabricator and based on the die size and design. Minimization of waste should be considered.

Some number of plates, as yet undetermined, of thickness 4 mm and 6 mm,(drawing #AT-10-1-12) will be required to use as correction plates in the even-tual stacking of the modules.

**Plate Punching**

_Master Plates_

The master plates (Drawing # AT-10-1-12) are to be die punched in two steps. The first step will produce the holes and slots, and the second step will reduce the raw plate size to final dimension. This second step is necessary since the key slots punched in the first step will be used to maintain the required tolerances on the width and the included angle on the finished plate.

_Spacer Plates_

It is suggested that the spacer plates be punched using a fine blanking technique; however, any method that is cost effective and will meet the specification is acceptable. Stack machining like sizes of spacer plates in multiples can be used as an alternative to punching if it is more cost effective.

**Flattening and Deburing**

All out of plane distortions, including burrs, must be removed from the plates after punching. The use of abrasive belt grinding is suggested for this process. Upon completion of this step, no out of plane distortions should be detectable when a straight edge is passed over the plate in both the radial (Y) and the \(\phi\) (X) directions.

**Stacking and Sorting**

Depending on how the raw plates are cut from the original sheet or coil, the individual plate thickness variations should be randomized. The material specification calls for turning and inverting every other sheet to nullify any systematic out of parallelism. The plate stacking orientation should follow this sequence after punching to eliminate the need for sorting prior to stacking in the final assembly.
