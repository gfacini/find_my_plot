###### Abstract

The aim of this note is to compare the discovery potential of ATLAS and CMS for the direct \(\PH\to\gamma\gamma\) channel, based on the results presented in the Technical Proposals of the two experiments, but treating in the same way those aspects which are detector independent, as for instance the signal and background cross-sections. A detailed comparison is presented for one mass point (\(m_{H}=110\) GeV) at both low and high luminosity.

Introduction

It is well known that the two photon decay mode is the most clean and promising way to detect a Standard Model Higgs at the LHC in the mass window \(80<~{}m_{H}<\)130 GeV. It is also known that the observability of this channel relies heavily on the performance of the electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter within the overall detector.

The \(\PH\to\gamma\gamma\) discovery potentials presented in the Technical Proposals of the two LHC experiments, ATLAS [1] and CMS [2], are quite different. This is shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, which give the expected significances for the direct \(\PH\to\gamma\gamma\) signal for one year of data taking at high luminosity (\(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)) and three years at low luminosity (\(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)). The significance is defined, for each mass point, as \(S/\sqrt{B}\), where \(S\) and \(B\) are the expected numbers of signal and background events in the chosen mass bin. It can be seen that the CMS results are a factor of two or more better than those of ATLAS (depending on the luminosity) over the mass range of interest.

Since the two experiments have treated in different ways aspects which are detector in dependent, such as the values for the production cross-sections or the choice of the kinematic cuts, this note is an attempt to understand which part of the difference in the results comes from the detector (mainly the electromagnetic calorimeter) performances and which part is due to the initial assumptions and specific choices. If the latter are assumed to be the same for the two experiments, then the ratio (\(R_{CMS/ATLAS}\)) between the CMS and the ATLAS significances is expected to scale roughly as

\[R_{CMS/ATLAS}\sim\sqrt{\frac{\Delta_{m}(ATLAS)}{\Delta_{m}(CMS)}}\times\frac{ \epsilon_{\gamma}(CMS)}{\epsilon_{\gamma}(ATLAS)}\]

where \(\Delta_{m}\), the chosen mass bin, and \(\epsilon_{\gamma}\), the total photon efficiency (trigger, identification, reconstruction), are detector dependent.

The comparison has been done in detail for one mass point, \(m_{H}=\) 110 GeV, and both the high luminosity case (Section 2) and the initial low luminosity period (Section 3) have been considered.

Table 1 summarizes the main numbers from the ATLAS and CMS analyses of a 110 GeV mass Higgs, as presented in the Technical Proposals and used for the comparison discussed below.

## 2 High luminosity case

Table 1 shows that at the LHC design luminosity the quoted significances for \(m_{H}\)=110 GeV are 5.1 and 10.4 for ATLAS and CMS respectively. However several differences between the two analyses have to be considered.

### Production cross-sections

In both experiments signal and background events are produced with PYTHIA 5.7, using one example of recent parametrizations of the proton structure functions [3].

Signal.Table 1 shows that the cross-section for Higgs production and decay to two photons used by CMS is a factor 1.58 larger than the one used by ATLAS. Most of the difference is due to the fact that the CMS cross-section includes a K-factor of 1.5, which takes into account higher order QCD corrections, while ATLAS does not use K-factors because these higher order corrections have not been calculated for all signal processes (in particular in the case of non-Standard Model Higgs bosons) nor, more importantly, for the irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) background to the \(\PH\to\gamma\gamma\) signal. The rest of the difference comes from the branching ratio for the two photon decay mode. The values given by PYTHIA are systematically lower than the results of recent theoretical calculations [4, 5]. Therefore CMS used the branching ratio given in [5], while the value of ATLAS is based on the calculation of the partial width \(\Gamma(\PH\to b\bar{b})\) of Ref. [4] (see [6] for more details).

Irreducible background.The irreducible background consists of genuine photon pairs produced via the following three diagrams: Born (\(\qq\to\gamma\gamma\)), Box (\(gg\to\gamma\gamma\)) and Bremsstrahlung (\(qg\to q\gamma\to q\gamma\gamma\)). These diagrams, although of similar magnitude in rate (see Table 2), correspond to different orders in QCD. Full calculations of the \(\gamma\gamma\) background, including next-to-leading order contributions, do not exist at present and are unlikely to become available in the near future. The cross-sections considered by ATLAS, therefore, do not include any K-factor, while CMS used a K-factor of 1.5 applied to the Box diagram alone. This explains the difference between the two experiments for the Box rates given in Table 2.

The Bremsstrahlung contribution is discussed in Section 2.2.

Conclusion.If the same values for the signal and background cross-sections are used in the two experiments, i.e. the ATLAS cross-section for the Higgs signal is multiplied by a factor 1.58 and the Box background in the first column of Table 2 by a factor 1.5, the ATLAS significance increases from 5.1 to 7.6, as shown in Table 4.

### Kinematic cuts

A common set of kinematic cuts for all values of \(m_{\PH}\) is used in both analyses: the two photon candidates, ordered in \(p_{T}\), are required to satisfy \(p_{T}^{1}>40\) GeV, \(p_{T}^{2}>25\) GeV, and to be in the rapidity region \(|\eta|<2.5\). Furthermore in the ATLAS analysis the photon candidates must satisfy \(p_{T}^{1}/(p_{T}^{1}+p_{T}^{2})<0.7\) ("\(p_{T}\)-balance") while in CMS this cut is not applied. The acceptance of these selections on the signal events is shown in Table 1 for the two experiments. The almost 20% higher value of CMS is due to the absence of the \(p_{T}\)-balance cut.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:4]

far been modelled using the parton shower approximation in PYTHIA and cross-checked to a certain extent with semi-analytical calculations. More work in this field, using also PHOTOS[11], will allow us to assess more accurately the importance of these contributions with respect to the Born and Box terms in Table 2.

### Photon reconstruction and identification efficiency

In addition to the set of kinematic cuts, other selections are needed to properly reconstruct and identify photons. These selections and their efficiencies, which are strongly detector dependent, are listed in Table 3 for the two experiments and discussed in detail below.

Fiducial cuts.In both analyses geometrical cuts are used to exclude regions of the EM calorimeter where the performance is significantly deteriorated with respect to the rest of the coverage. In ATLAS, photons traversing the transition between the barrel and the end-cap calorimeters, where the relatively large amount of passive material in front of the Accordion spoils the energy resolution, were rejected. A careful optimization of the detector layout in this region[12], leading for instance to a thinner cryostat wall and a shorter solenoidal coil than in the Letter of Intent, allowed to limit the geometrical cut to a small rapidity range: \(1.42<|\eta|<1.57\). The average efficiency of this selection is **96.4%** per photon for \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) events and **93%** per photon for the \(\gamma\gamma\) irreducible background.

In the CMS analysis, the acceptance of the fiducial cuts is **90%** per photon. These cuts are needed to reject photons crossing the transition between the barrel and the end-cap calorimeter or the borders between the mechanical sub-units containing the crystals (baskets).

Photon identification efficiency.In ATLAS the photon identification efficiency is **80%** and comes from the set of calorimeter cuts needed to trigger the experiment and to reduce the jet-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet backgrounds (see Section 2.4). The effect of these cuts was evaluated on a sample of \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) events after superimposing the expected pile-up at full luminosity.

In CMS the photon efficiency is **71%**. Part of this value (88%) comes from the cuts used for the jet and \(\pi^{0}\) rejection, while the rest (81%) is due to the fact that, in the CMS analysis, photons which convert in the inner detector are rejected. For converted photons, the energy resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter and the signal acceptance in the mass bin would be significantly deteriorated by the effect of the 4 T magnetic field (see Fig. 11.19 of the CMS Technical Proposal).

Acceptance in the mass bin.The mass bins chosen to compute the number of signal and background events, and therefore the significance, are \(\pm 1.15\sigma_{m}=2\) GeV in the CMS analysis and \(\pm 1.2\sigma_{m}=3.36\) GeV in ATLAS, where \(\sigma_{m}\) is the expected mass resolution. The fraction of signal events contained in these mass bins is estimated to be 75% for both experiments 1. The mass bin acceptance is very sensitive to tails in the distribution of the \(\gamma\gamma\) invariant mass, coming for instance from photon conversions in the tracker or from regions of the electromagnetic calorimeter with degraded energy resolution (near to the transition between barrel and end-cap, cracks, etc.). In ATLAS the mass bin acceptance was determined with a full simulation of \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) events in the inner detector and calorimeter, which included also the expected number of pile-up events at full luminosity, whereas in CMS it was computed at particle level.

Footnote 1: An acceptance of 70% is quoted in the ATLAS Technical Proposal before the fiducial cuts rejecting photons in the barrel/end-cap transition region.

Conclusion.The total photon reconstruction and identification efficiencies are therefore

\[\epsilon_{\gamma}=0.96\times 0.8=0.77\] ( \[ATLAS\] )

\[\epsilon_{\gamma}=0.9\times 0.88\times 0.81=0.64\] ( \[CMS\] )

The ATLAS efficiency given above was decreased by an additional factor 0.9 for the case \(m_{H}\)=90 GeV, in order to account for the rejection of the very dangerous resonant background from \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\). This explains the difference in shape between the ATLAS and CMS significance curves in Figs. 1 and 2.

In summary the signal cross-section accepted after kinematic cuts has to be further reduced by a factor 0.44 in ATLAS and 0.31 in CMS. These factors include also the acceptance in the mass bin.

### Reducible background

The main reducible background to the \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) signal comes from \(\gamma\)-jet and jet-jet events where one or two jets are misidentified as photons. For pairs of calorimeter clusters which pass the kinematic cuts and have an invariant mass between 70 and 170 GeV, the ratios of the jet-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet cross-sections to the irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) cross-section are \(2\times 10^{6}\) and \(8\times 10^{2}\) respectively. There are large uncertainties (up to a factor of five [7]) on the rates of jet-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet events which are expected to satisfy the photon identification criteria, arising from theoretical uncertainties on the production cross-sections, from uncertainties on the jet fragmentation into leading \(\pi^{0}\)'s, and from uncertainties in the simulation of the detector response. Therefore the jet backgrounds, as simulated at present, must be reduced well below the level of the irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum, which requires rejections of the order of \(2\times 10^{7}\) against jet-jet and \(8\times 10^{3}\) against \(\gamma\)-jet events.

Figure 3 shows the rejection of the reducible background achieved in ATLAS with a full simulation of the calorimeters and inner tracker. It can be seen that after the \(\gamma\)/jet identification cuts, including the rejection of isolated \(\pi^{0}\)'s in the strip section of the EM calorimeter, the dominant contribution comes from \(\gamma\)-jet events. For \(m_{H}\)=110 GeV, the total jet background amounts to about 16% of the \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum, with 4% coming from jet-jet and 12% from \(\gamma\)-jet. This factor was included in the significances given in the ATLAS Technical Proposal (see Table 11.2 in [1]). Without using the fine granularity of the strip section of the calorimeter, the total jet background would increase to about 65% of the irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum (see Fig. 11.2 in [1]).

CMS did not include the contribution of the reducible background in the significances [2]. The residual jet-jet background at 110 GeV after the identification cuts amounts to 10% of the irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) (Fig. 11.18 of the CMS Technical Proposal). When one considers also the (dominant) \(\gamma\)-jet contribution, the total jet background becomes 30% of the continuum [13]. This value has recently been reduced to 14% [14], for the same photon efficiency. Figure 1 in [14] shows that, for \(m_{H}\)=110 GeV, the jet-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet backgrounds contribute 3% and 11% of the \(\gamma\gamma\) background respectively. Therefore it seems that similar rejections against the jet backgrounds are achieved by the two experiments for an estimated photon efficiency of 80% in ATLAS (studied with full simulation of large statistics di-jet and \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) samples) and of 88% in CMS (studied at particle level). In addition Ref. [14] stresses that the fine granularity of the silicon preshower, available in front of the end-cap calorimeter at all luminosities and in front of the barrel calorimeter at high luminosity, has not been used to obtain the results of Fig. 1, which nevertheless demonstrates a rejection of about three against \(\pi^{0}\)'s, almost independent of mass, for 94% photon efficiency. In contrast Fig. 11.17 of the CMS Technical Proposal shows, for the same photon efficiency, a \(\pi^{0}\) rejection of 1.5 for \(p_{T}\)=50 GeV, and less than three down to \(p_{T}\)=30 GeV.

We believe that the detector performances in this important aspect of the \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) physics can only be realistically compared using studies based on full simulations of the whole detector. To compare the two experiments on equal grounds, we have excluded the residual jet background from the ATLAS significance, which consequently increases to 9.3 (Table 4).

### Summary for high luminosity

If the same assumptions are made for the signal and background cross-sections in the two experiments, if the same kinematic cuts are used, and if the residual jet background is excluded from the calculation of the significances, the discovery potentials of ATLAS and CMS at high luminosity for a 110 GeV mass \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) are the same within \(\sim 10\%\) (line five of Table 4). This result, which can be easily extrapolated to the whole mass range of interest (Fig. 1), is roughly explained by noting, as suggested in the Introduction, that what CMS gains in mass resolution, thanks to the expected better performance of the crystal calorimeter (see Table 1), is lost in acceptance due to the rejection of the converted photons, namely

\[R_{CMS/ATLAS}\sim\sqrt{\frac{3.36\ \mathrm{GeV}}{2.0\ \mathrm{GeV}}}\times 0.83 \simeq 1.08\]

where 0.83 is the ratio between the total photon efficiencies expected by ATLAS and CMS (last line of Table 3).

Some room for improvement exists in both experiments. In ATLAS, since the Technical Proposal, the analysis of \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) events in the final (optimized) detector layout resulted in a decrease of the mass resolution to 1.3 GeV for \(m_{H}\)=110 GeV, which would increase the expected significance from 9.3 to 9.7. Furthermore the use of liquid krypton instead of argon 2 as an active medium for the barrel EM calorimeter would allow to improve the mass resolution to 1.15 GeV and the significance to 10.4, as shown in Table 4. In CMS a fraction of the rejected photons, mainly those converting at the largest radii of the inner detector, may be recovered.

Footnote 2: The choice between the two liquids is still open.

Finally, the last line of Table 4 gives the expected significances in case the constant term of the calorimeter energy resolution were 1%, instead of 0.7% (ATLAS, measured in test beam) and 0.5% (CMS). Liquid argon was assumed as an active medium for ATLAS.

Since the residual jet background (15% at least) has not been included in the last three lines of Table 4, the significances quoted there should be taken as optimistic.

In conclusion, although the results presented in the ATLAS Technical Proposal might be considered conservative, the uncertainty arising from the lack of knowledge of the \(\gamma\gamma\) background cross-sections remains large. Therefore we believe that the significances in the ATLAS Technical Proposal are our present best estimates.

## 3 Low luminosity case

At low luminosity, the reconstruction of the \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) mass benefits from the absence of the high pile-up level which affects the data taken at full luminosity. This has two effects: the calorimeter energy resolution improves because the pile-up term is largely reduced (a factor of three); improved knowledge of the vertex position along the \(z\)-axis reduces the contribution of the angular measurement to the mass resolution (see Fig. 11.20 in [2]).

The resulting gain in the \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) mass resolution, and therefore in the significance, is detector dependent. In ATLAS the energy resolution is dominated by the sampling term, which contributes about 1 GeV out of 1.4 GeV, and removing the pile-up has a relatively small incidence on the total mass width (Table 1). In CMS a larger improvement is expected for two reasons. At low luminosity there will be no preshower detector in front of the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter, therefore the sampling term of the energy resolution for non-converted photons will approach the intrinsic performance of the crystals (\(2\%/\sqrt{\mathrm{E}}\) compared to \(5\%\sqrt{\mathrm{E}}\) at high luminosity). Furthermore the various contributions to the mass resolution (sampling term of the energy resolution, pile-up, constant term, electronic noise of the electromagnetic calorimeter and angular resolution) are similar in size, therefore the absence of pile-up has a larger impact on the total mass resolution (see Table 1).

The \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) discovery potential after three LHC years at low luminosity is given in the last line of Table 1 for the two experiments.

If the same procedure as in the high luminosity case is followed, namely:

* the CMS choices of K-factors are included in the signal and background cross-sections of ATLAS as explained in Section 2.1
* the \(p_{T}\)-balance cut is removed from the ATLAS analysis
* the jet background is not included in the \(S/\sqrt{B}\) of ATLAS

the significances of the two experiments evolve as shown in Table 5. It can be seen that in this case a difference of \(\sim\)30% in favour of CMS persists even after the two analyses have been treated consistently. This is because of the larger improvement in the mass resolution of CMS with respect to ATLAS at low luminosity, as explained above, which is not balanced anymore by the lower photon efficiency:

\[R_{\mathit{CMS/ATLAS}}\sim\sqrt{\frac{3.0\ \mathrm{GeV}}{1.24\ \mathrm{GeV}}} \times 0.83\simeq 1.3\]

The latest results of the ATLAS simulations since the Technical Proposal allowed to improve the mass resolution to 1.18 GeV, and therefore the significance from 5.8 to 6.0. Furthermore the use of liquid krypton in the barrel EM calorimeter is expected to improve the mass resolution to 0.98 GeV for \(m_{H}\)=110 GeV, and hence the significance to 6.5 (Table 5).

Finally Table 5 gives also (last line) the expected significances in case of a 1% constant term of the energy resolution in the calorimeters of both experiments. Liquid argon was assumed as an active medium for ATLAS.

## 4 Conclusion

In this note we have presented a comparison of the ATLAS and CMS discovery potentials for the \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channel at the LHC. The main conclusion of this study, which is based only on the results presented in the Technical Proposals, is that using the same cross-sections for signal and irreducible background leads to rather similar performances for the two experiments. More work, however, has to be done on the rejection of the jet backgrounds and of the Bremsstrahlung process.
