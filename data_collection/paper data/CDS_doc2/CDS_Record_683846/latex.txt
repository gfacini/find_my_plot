The different analytical expressions for matrix element for \(B_{d}^{0}\to{K^{*}}^{0}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) were implemented into PYTHIA and compared with results obtained with standard PYTHIA matrix element. It is shown that the matrix elements do not change an inclusive parameters of muons and K\({}^{*0}\)-meson, but strongly influence on the spectra of dimuon mass and forward-backward charge asymmetry. The signal-to-background ratio for the worse case is expected to be 1. It will allow us to measure the characteristics of \(B_{d}^{0}\to{K^{*}}^{0}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decay with sufficient accuracy to make choice between SM and some variants of MSSM after 3 years LHC run at low luminosity.

**1.Introduction.**

The rare semileptonic \(B\)-decays with \(b\)-quark transition \(b\to(s,d)l^{+}l^{-}\) are foreseen to be sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model ( SM ). The reason for such hopes is that these transitions are caused by Flavor Changing Neutral Current ( FCNC ) and forbidden at the tree level in the SM [1]. They are predicted to have a very small probabilities of \(10^{-5}\) - \(10^{-11}\). In the nonstandard models of electroweak interactions FCNC processes are allowed at tree level. In addition, the one-loop diagrams connected with new vertices between SUSY particles play a dominant role in the non-standard physics. It may lead to increasing of branching ratios for rare FCNC decays. So, an experimental studies of such decays open a window on physics beyond the SM. In this paper only \(b\to s\) transitions are considered.

The effective Hamiltonian for \(b\to s\) in the SM at hadronic mass scale corresponding to the \(B\)-meson mass can be expanded over operators describing all possible \(B\)-decays and has the form [1]

\[{\cal H}_{eff}=\frac{4G_{F}}{\sqrt{2}}V_{tb}V_{ts}^{*}\,\sum_{i}C_{i}(\mu)\,O_ {i}(\mu), \tag{1}\]

Here \(O_{i}(\mu)\) are basis operators, \(C_{i}(\mu)\) are Wilson coefficients, parameter \(\mu\sim m_{b}\) separates a soft and hard contributions of strong interactions. A hard contribution is calculated with the perturbative QCD analysis and presented in Wilson coefficients. A soft contribution should be included specially in the matrix elements, calculated with operators \(O_{i}\) between initial and final hadron states. The effective Hamiltonian for the decay \(b\to(s,d)l^{+}l^{-}\) is:

\[{\cal H}_{eff}(b\to sl^{+}l^{-})=\frac{G_{F}}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{ \alpha_{em}}{2\pi}V_{ts}^{*}\,V_{tb}\left[\,-2\frac{C_{7\gamma}(m_{b})}{q^{2} }\left((m_{b}+m_{s})(\bar{s}i\sigma_{\mu\nu}q^{\nu}b)+(m_{b}-m_{s})(\bar{s}i \sigma_{\mu\nu}q^{\nu}\gamma_{5}b)\right)(\bar{l}\gamma^{\mu}l)+\right. \tag{2}\] \[\left.C_{9V}^{eff}(m_{b},q^{2})(\bar{s}\gamma_{\mu}(1-\gamma_{5}) b)(\bar{l}\gamma^{\mu}l)+C_{10A}(m_{b})(\bar{s}\gamma_{\mu}(1-\gamma_{5})b)(\bar{l} \gamma^{\mu}\gamma_{5}l)\right]\]

Here \(q^{2}\) is the invariant mass squared of the lepton pair. The amplitude of the \(B\)-decay \(B\to K(K^{*})l^{+}l^{-}\) contains the hadronic matrix element of the operator (2) between the initial and final mesons state. Long-distance dynamic effects related to meson structure are contained in relativistic-invariant form factors. They appear in bilinear quark current \(\bar{s}\Gamma b\) from the effective Hamiltonian (2) in Lorents covariant expansion of the meson transition amplitude. The \(q^{2}\)-dependence of the form factors gives the realistic estimations for the cross sections of \(B\)-decays. Results of such estimations for \(B\to K(K^{*})\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) are presented in Sec. 2. The matrix elements for these decays are implemented in the PYTHIA event generator.The expected event numbers for different theoretical form factor calculations, or different sets of model parameters, are shown for the ATLAS Detector. The comparison of the samples of events, generated by PYTHIA with the implemented matrix elements and without it is presented in Sec. 3.

The sensitivity of ATLAS experiment in rare semileptonic \(B\)-meson decays to the physics beyond the SM is considered in Sec. 4. The conclusions are presented in Sec. 5.

**2. Form factors and decay widths for \(B\to K(K^{*})\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\).**

Generally the matrix elements of operators \(O_{i}\), presented in effective Hamiltonian (1), (2) have the forms [2]:

\[<P(M_{2},p_{2})|V_{\mu}(0)|P(M_{1},p_{1})> = f_{+}(q^{2})P_{\mu}+f_{-}(q^{2})q_{\mu},\] \[<V(M_{2},p_{2},\epsilon)|V_{\mu}(0)|P(M_{1},p_{1})> = 2g(q^{2})\epsilon_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}\epsilon^{*\nu}\,p_{1}^{ \alpha}\,p_{2}^{\beta},\] \[<V(M_{2},p_{2},\epsilon)|A_{\mu}(0)|P(M_{1},p_{1})> = i\epsilon^{*\alpha}\,[\,f(q^{2})g_{\mu\alpha}+a_{+}(q^{2})p_{1 \alpha}P_{\mu}+a_{-}(q^{2})p_{1\alpha}q_{\mu}\,],\] \[<P(M_{2},p_{2})|T_{\mu\nu}(0)|P(M_{1},p_{1})> = -2i\,s(q^{2})\,(p_{1\mu}p_{2\nu}-p_{1\nu}p_{2\mu}),\] \[<V(M_{2},p_{2},\epsilon)|T_{\mu\nu}(0)|P(M_{1},p_{1})> = i\epsilon^{*\alpha}\,[\,g_{+}(q^{2})\epsilon_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta} P^{\beta}+g_{-}(q^{2})\epsilon_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}q^{\beta}+h(q^{2})p_{1 \alpha}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\beta\gamma}p_{1}^{\beta}p_{2}^{\gamma}\,], \tag{3}\]where \(V_{\mu}=\bar{s}\gamma_{\mu}b\), \(A_{\mu}=\bar{s}\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5}b\), \(T_{\mu\nu}=\bar{s}\sigma_{\mu\nu}b\) vector, axial-vector and tensor currents, \(q=p_{1}-p_{2}\), \(P=p_{1}+p_{2}\)1. \(g\), \(g_{+}\), \(g_{-}\), \(f\), \(h\), \(a_{+}\), \(a_{-}\), \(f_{+}\), \(f_{-}\) and \(s\) are the relativistic invariant form factors, which calculated within the relativistic invariant quark model with the constituents at the mass surface [3].

Footnote 1: We use the following notations: \(\gamma^{5}=i\gamma^{0}\gamma^{1}\gamma^{2}\gamma^{3}\), \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}=\frac{i}{2}[\gamma_{\mu},\gamma_{\nu}]\), \(\epsilon^{0123}=-1\), \(\gamma_{5}\sigma_{\mu\nu}=-\frac{i}{2}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}\sigma^{ \alpha\beta}\), and \(Sp(\gamma^{5}\gamma^{\mu}\gamma^{\nu}\gamma^{\alpha}\gamma^{\beta})=4ie^{ \mu\nu\alpha\beta}\).

From formula (2) and (3) the expressions for differential decay widths may be obtained in the following forms:

\[\frac{d^{2}\Gamma(B\to Kl^{+}l^{-})}{dsd\hat{t}}=-\frac{G_{F}^{2}M_{1}^{5}|V_{ ts}^{*}V_{tb}|^{2}\alpha_{em}^{2}}{56\pi^{5}}\hat{\Pi}(\hat{s},\hat{t})\beta, \tag{4}\]

where

\[\beta=|C_{9V}^{eff}(m_{b},q^{2})f_{+}(q^{2})+2(m_{b}+m_{s})C_{7\gamma}(m_{b}) s(q^{2})|^{2}+|C_{10A}(m_{b})f_{+}(q^{2})|^{2},\]

and \(\hat{s}=q^{2}/M_{1}^{2}\), \(\hat{t}=(p_{1}-p_{l^{+}})^{2}/M_{1}^{2}\), \(k=(M_{2}/M_{1})^{2}\) and \(\hat{\Pi}=(\hat{t}-1)(\hat{t}-k)+\hat{s}\hat{t}\).

\[\frac{d^{2}\Gamma(B\to K^{*}l^{+}l^{-})}{dsd\hat{t}}=\frac{G_{F}^{2}M_{1}^{5}| V_{ts}^{*}V_{tb}|^{2}\alpha_{em}^{2}}{512\pi^{5}}(\beta^{(1)}+\beta^{(2)}). \tag{5}\]

Here

\[\beta^{(1)}=2\hat{s}(\frac{\phi}{2}+\hat{\Pi})|G(q^{2})|^{2}+\left[\hat{s}- \frac{\hat{\Pi}}{2k}\right]|F(q^{2})|^{2}-\frac{\phi^{2}}{2k}\hat{\Pi}|H_{+}( q^{2})|^{2}+2\frac{\hat{s}+k-1}{2k}\hat{\Pi}R(q^{2}),\]

\[\beta^{(2)}=2\hat{s}[2\hat{t}+\hat{s}-k-1]R_{1}(q^{2}),\]

\[\phi=1+k^{2}+\hat{s}^{2}-2k-2\hat{s}-2k\hat{s}\equiv\lambda(1,k,\hat{s})\]

and [4]:

\[|G(q^{2})|^{2}=\left|C_{9V}^{eff}(m_{b},q^{2})M_{1}g(q^{2})-\frac{2C_{7\gamma }(m_{b})}{\hat{s}}\frac{m_{b}+m_{s}}{M_{1}}g_{+}(q^{2})\right|^{2}+|C_{10A}(m _{b})M_{1}g(q^{2})|^{2},\]

The \(q^{2}\)-dependencies of the form factors have been obtained using two sets of quark model parameters, shown in Table I. The first set of parameters corresponds to the ISGW2 approximation. The second set corresponds to GI parametrization. The coefficients for these two parametrizations of form factor \(q^{2}\)-dependence can be found in [5]. Using of the different parametrizations of form factors leads to the different predictions of cross-sections and dimuon mass distributions.

The theoretical predictions for the branching ratios for \(\rm B\to K\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(\rm B\to K^{*}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays are presented in Table II for two sets of the Quark Model parameters. The differences in predicted values are rather large, the ratios of them reach factor about 2. It should be noted that the difference between predictions of Quark Model with GI and ISGW2 form factor parametrizations can be considered as the theoretical uncertainty of Quark Model predictions. To compare the branching ratios obtained with Quark Model with calculations of Ali based on heavy quark symmetry relations, we present the average value for two sets of quark model parameters in the Table II in the third line. One can see the bad agreement between quark model approach and old Ali results [6] ( difference about factor 2 ), which have been used in our previous estimations for ATLAS [7]. The predictions, presented in [6] are shown in fourth line of Table II.

The analytical expressions for the widths of rare semileptonic B-decays include the matrix elements between initial and final hadron states. As it was shown in [12] these matrix elements are sensible to the value of soft contribution of strong interaction.

In the calculation of decay width and asymmetry, the sign of Wilson coefficient \(C_{7\gamma}\) is very important. It was found in [8] that at \(m_{SUSY}>200GeV\) the sign of interferent members is defined by the ratio \(R_{7\gamma}=C_{7\gamma}(M_{W})_{MSSM}/C_{7\gamma}(M_{W})_{SM}\). The fact that asymmetry is not affected by soft contribution of strong interaction and that it depends on the interferent members, or the sign of ratio \(R_{7\gamma}\), allows us to assume that the study of behaviour of asymmetry will help us to reject a very large interval of the ratio \(R_{7\gamma}\).

The conclusion is that results of this work decrease the probabilities for rare semileptonic \(B\)-decays in SM. It should be noted, that new results of A.Ali [9] have the lower value of branching ratios and are in the good agreement with Quark Model results. They are shown in the last line of Table II.

**3. Study of the possibility to search for \(\rm B_{d}^{0}\to K^{*0}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays with ATLAS detector.**

In order to study the dependence of characteristics of the decay \(B_{d}^{0}\to K^{*0}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) on different matrix elements, 3 sets of signal events have been generated with PYTHIA. The first set of events was generated using the phase-space decay of B-meson. The second sample of events included decays with GI matrix element and the last set was generated with ISGW2 matrix element. Quark model parameters used at generation of the last two samples of events are shown in the Table 1. The particle parameters were smeared according to the expected experimental resolution. The probability to identify a muon was assumed to be \(\epsilon_{\mu}=0.8\)[7].

In the Fig.1 (a,b) the distributions of largest \(p_{T}\) of muon and of \(p_{T}\) of second muon are shown for 3 sets of events. The corresponding average values \(p_{Tmin}^{\mu}\) and \(p_{Tmax}^{\mu}\) for three samples are presented in Table III. One can see from the spectra and average values that muon \(p_{T}\)-distributions in rare semileptonic \(B\)-decay are not sensitive to the \(q^{2}\)-dependence of matrix element. So, any deviation of muon \(p_{T}\) distribution from the predicted by SM one, can be considered as the indication of physics beyond SM. Due to the absence of any dependence of muon \(p_{T}\) spectra on the matrix elements we expect that the sharp cuts on \(p_{T}\) of muons ( caused by the trigger requirements and muon identification) will not reduce the expected cross-section of \(B_{d}^{0}\to K^{*0}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) signal stronger than we assumed in our previous studies.

The similarity of muon parameters means that decay kinematics of the events is practically the same. It is demonstrated by the results in Table IV, where the sensitivity of signal event samples to cuts is shown with corresponding cross-section of background events. The cuts proposed in [7] and have the following form (see also Table IV):

1) The decay lengths of the reconstructed \(\rm B_{d}^{0}\) and \(\rm K^{*0}\) were required to be more than 1 mm and \(\chi^{2}\) per number of degrees of freedom of the reconstructed \(\rm B_{d}^{0}\) vertex was required to be smaller than 3. This cut is expected to be effective in suppressing tracks from the primary vertex and Drell-Yan pairs.
2) Angle between the vector directed from primary vertex to the vertex of \(\rm B_{d}^{0}\) decay and the vector of \(\rm B_{d}^{0}\)'s transverse momentum \(\alpha<3^{\circ}\). This cut suppresses the background combinations in the case where particles are from different jets.

3) Requirement of absence of charged particles with \(p_{T}>1\) GeV/\(c\) in the cone \(<9^{\circ}\) around the B-direction. This cut suppresses background combinations from two b-quarks produced by a gluon splitting.
4) The effective dimuon mass should be out of the J/\(\psi\) and \(\psi^{\prime}\) mass regions. To exclude the muons from J/\(\psi\), the mass region \(3.009<M_{\mu\mu}^{eff}<3.185\), corresponding to \(\pm 5\) standard deviations of the J/\(\psi\)-mass with ATLAS resolution, was rejected. The muon paires with masses \(\pm 100\) MeV/\(c^{2}\) around the average \(\psi^{\prime}\)-mass were also excluded.
5) The transverse momentum of the K\({}^{*0}\) should be greater than 5 GeV/\(c\).

The probabilities to pass rejection cuts are the same for all three event samples. The most sensitive to event kinematics could be the cut on \(p_{T}\) of \(K^{*0}\)-meson. The normalized \(p_{T}\) distributions of \(K^{*0}\)-meson are shown in Fig. 1 (c). No disagreement between all three samples of events is observed. It should be noted, that the presented inclusive one particle distributions depend mainly on the \(B\)-meson production inclusive spectra and acceptance of the detector.

The particle distributions in \(B\)-meson c.m.s. could be more sensitive to the decay form factors. The dilepton mass distributions for events of three samples are presented in Fig. 1 (d). In this figure all distributions have the same normalization to unity and the relative differences in dilepton mass distributions could be observed. The peak at small \(\hat{s}\) is observed in the samples with decays with included matrix elements, while in the simplest case the distribution has approximately flat at small \(\hat{s}\). In the case of IGSW2 parametrization the peak is more pronounced than in the case of GI parametrization.

In Fig. 2 the same dilepton mass distributions are normalised in accordance with predicted branching ratios. Here the differences between the predicted spectra are more clear as it could be observed in the experiment.

The expected signal event numbers for one year (\(10^{-7}\) sec.) LHC run at low luminosity are presented in Table 5. The cross-sections for background events are calculated by renormalisation of background estimations, obtained in [7].

**4. The possibility to measure Forward-Backward charge asymmetry in decay \(B_{d}^{0}\to K^{*0}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\).**

The \(B_{d}^{0}\to X_{s}l^{+}l^{-}\) decay rate and distributions can demonstrate large deviations from the SM induced by the SUSY correction to \(C_{7}(M_{W})\). SUSY contributions will be largest if \(\mu\) is very large and tan\(\beta\) is not too large (\(<30\)) [8]. Examining the charged Higgs boson contribution to \(B_{s}\to X_{s}\gamma\) showed [8] that Wilson coefficients \(C_{7}\) and \(C_{8}\) are always larger than those of the SM, independent on tan\(\beta\). This leads to the familiar bound \(m_{H^{\pm}}>260\) GeV.

As was pointed in [7], two important distributions for \(B_{d}^{0}\to K^{*0}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decay mode can be investigated in experiment:

1) Invariant dilepton mass distribution \(d\Gamma\big{/}d\hat{s}\), which obtained after integration on the \(\hat{t}\) variable in (4) - (5) and

2) Forward-backward charge asymmetry \(A_{FB}(\hat{s})\), defined by equation:

\[A_{FB}(\hat{s})=\frac{\int\limits_{0}^{1}\frac{d^{2}\Gamma}{d\hat{s}d\cos( \theta)}d\cos(\theta)-\int\limits_{-1}^{0}\frac{d^{2}\Gamma}{d\hat{s}d\cos( \theta)}d\cos(\theta)}{\int\limits_{0}^{1}\frac{d^{2}\Gamma}{d\hat{s}d\cos( \theta)}d\cos(\theta)+\int\limits_{-1}^{0}\frac{d^{2}\Gamma}{d\hat{s}d\cos( \theta)}d\cos(\theta)}, \tag{6}\]

where \(\theta\)-is the angle between the \(l^{+}\) and \(B\)-meson direction in the rest frame of the lepton pair.

The calculation of FB-asymmetry in SM and MSSM were fulfiled in [12]. In Fig. 3 the FB-asymmetry distributions for SM is shown for two sets of quark model parameters (see Table 1). There are no differencies between two curves. So, long-distance effects practically don't influence the asymmetry distribution. The comparison of asymmetry distributions for SM and MSSM is shown in Fig. 4(a). The asymmetry distributions are shown for resonanse and non-resonanse event samples. From this figure the \(q^{2}\)-region with resonanse contribution could be seen clear. To exclude the resonanse region of \(d\Gamma\big{/}d\hat{s}\) distribution the following \(\hat{s}\)-intervals can be used in analysis:

1) low \(\hat{s}\)-range \(\hat{s}_{min}<\hat{s}<0.33\), where \(\hat{s}_{min}=4m_{l}^{2}/M_{1}^{2}\),

2) high \(\hat{s}\)-range \(0.55<\hat{s}<\hat{s}_{max}\), where \(\hat{s}_{max}=(M_{1}-M_{2})^{2}/M_{1}^{2}\).

Besides, one can see from Fig. 4(a) that the asymmetry predicted by SM, changes its sign in the first \(\hat{s}\)-range and its average value is close to zero. So, it is reasonable to measure the asymmetry in the intervals \(\hat{s}_{min}<\hat{s}<0.14\) and \(0.14<\hat{s}<0.33\) separately. The event number shared for three \(\hat{s}\)-ranges are shown in Table 6.

In Table VI the theoretical predictions of FB-asymmetry in different models for three \(\hat{s}\)-ranges (from \(\hat{s}_{1}\) to \(\hat{s}_{2}\)) are presented. They were calculated according to the following expression:

\[<A_{FB}>_{[\hat{s}_{1},\hat{s}_{2}]}=\frac{<N_{F}>_{[\hat{s}_{1},\hat{s}_{2}]}-<N _{B}>_{[\hat{s}_{1},\hat{s}_{2}]}}{<N_{F}>_{[\hat{s}_{1},\hat{s}_{2}]}+<N_{B}>_ {[\hat{s}_{1},\hat{s}_{2}]}} \tag{7}\]

where \(<N_{F}>_{[\hat{s}_{1},\hat{s}_{2}]}\) and \(<N_{B}>_{[\hat{s}_{1},\hat{s}_{2}]}\) are the numbers of positive leptons moving in the forward and backward directions of B-meson correspondingly and are defined by the next expressions:

\[<N_{F}>_{[\hat{s}_{1},\hat{s}_{2}]}\sim\int\limits_{\hat{s}_{1}}^{\hat{s}_{2}} [\beta_{V}(\hat{s})+3\hat{s}\phi^{1/2}R_{1}(\hat{s})]d\hat{s},\qquad<N_{B}>_{ [\hat{s}_{1},\hat{s}_{2}]}\sim\int\limits_{\hat{s}_{1}}^{\hat{s}_{2}}[\beta_{ V}(\hat{s})-3\hat{s}\phi^{1/2}R_{1}(\hat{s})]d\hat{s},\]

\[\beta_{V}(\hat{s})=2\hat{\phi}\hat{s}|G(q^{2})|^{2}+\left[2\hat{s}+\frac{(1- k-\hat{s})^{2}}{4k}\right]|F(q^{2})|^{2}+\frac{\phi^{2}}{4k}|H_{+}(q^{2})|^{2} -2\frac{\phi}{4k}(\hat{s}-1+k)R(q^{2}).\]

One can see from the Table VI that SM and MSSM predictions for both types of form factors are in a very good agreement at \(\hat{s}\geq 0.55\). At other values of \(\hat{s}\) there is some probability to separate these models if the accuracy of asymmetry measurement would be enough.

The expected parts of events in the different \(\hat{s}\)-intervals for GI and ISGW2 parametrisations are shown in the Table VII. Let us estimate the lower limits of asymmetry value in these three \(\hat{s}\)-intervals after 3 year LHC run at low luminosity in the worst case ( ISGW2 form factor parametrization predicted the lower value of cross-section). Studying the dimuon mass spectrum at this case we can expect \(N_{s}=1323\) signal and \(N_{BG}=552\) background events in the \(\hat{s}_{min}<\hat{s}<0.14\) region. The asymmetry

\[<A_{FB}>_{[\hat{s}_{1},\hat{s}_{2}],means}=\frac{<N_{F}>_{[\hat{s}_{1},\hat{s }_{2}]}-<N_{B}>_{[\hat{s}_{1},\hat{s}_{2}]}}{<N_{F}>_{[\hat{s}_{1},\hat{s}_{2} ]}+<N_{B}>_{[\hat{s}_{1},\hat{s}_{2}]}+N_{BG}}=\frac{\Delta N}{N_{s}+N_{BG}} \tag{8}\]

can be reliably measured if the \(\Delta N\) would exceed \(2\sigma\) (where \(\sigma=\sqrt{N_{s}+N_{BG}}\)). So, measured asymmetry \(\mid A_{means}\mid\) would be of 4.6 % and corresponding real value \(\mid A_{real}\mid=\Delta N/N_{s}\) of 6.5 %. It means that in this \(\hat{s}\)-region the asymmetry may be measured only if it would be greater than 7 %. The same estimations show that in the \(0.14<\hat{s}<0.33\) range the lower limit for measurement of the real asymmetry is 6 %. The obtained estimations for ISGW2 and GI parametrization are presented in the Table VIII.

It is obvious that at expected lower limit for measurements of asymmetry of batter than 10 % there will be possible to reject a very large class of MSSM with \(R_{7\gamma}<0\) if a measured asymmetry occured to be positive in the interval \(\hat{s}_{min}<\hat{s}<0.14\).

Let us consider the more complex case when a measured asymmetry has a positive sign in the first \(\hat{s}\)-region. MSSM predictions are out of expected accuracy ( smaller than 9 %). Fortunately the measurements in the second \(\hat{s}\)-range will allow us to discuss more definitely about presence or absence of a new physics. In high \(\hat{s}\)-region SM and MSSM are not distinguished. Here the measurements can be used for general analysis of experimental sensitivity.

**5. Conclusions.**

The estimation of possibility of the detail study of the rare \(B\to K^{*}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decay was obtained using the latest predictions of quark model for form factor of this decay.

1) There is uncertainty in form factor calculations in the quark model. It influences the branching fraction of the decay and dimuon mass distribution, but does not change the forward-backward charge asymmetry. The behaviour of asymmetry as a function of the dimuon mass strongly differs in SM and some classes of MSSM.
2) Use of different matrix element shows that one-particle spectra are not sensitive to them. The spectrum of dimuon mass and FB-asymmetry are changed by matrix elements strongly.
3) It was shown, that it will be possible to measure the branching fraction of rare decay \(B\to K^{*}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) with high accuracy. The expected ration Signal/BG is within the \(2\div 4\) for different matrix elements.
4) Even for the ratio R=Signal/BG=2 it will be possible to measure the asymmetry with accuracy of 10% after 3 years LHS at low luminosity. This is sufficient to make choice between SM and some variants of MSSM.

Table 7: Expected absolute lower limits for asymmetry measurements after 3 years LHC run at low luminosity (\(\hat{s}_{min}=4m_{l}^{2}/M_{B}^{2}\), where \(m_{l}\) is lepton mass and \(\hat{s}_{max}=(M_{B}-M_{K^{*}})^{2}/M_{B}^{2}\)).

Figure 1: The different characteristics for decay \(B_{d}^{0}\to K^{*0}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) for different matrix elements. Solid line corresponds to phase-space calculation, dashed – GI parameters (set 2) and dotted – ISGW2 parameters (Set 1). For other determination see text in Sec. 3.

Figure 3: Forward–backward asymmetry \(A_{FB}\) for decay: \(B\to K^{*}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\). Solid - ISGW2 parameters, dashed - GI parameters.

Figure 2: Invariant dilepton mass distribution, normalised on the cross section corresponding PYTHIA calculation. Solid line corresponds to phase-space calculation, dashed – to GI parameters (set 2) and dotted – to ISGW2 parameters (Set 1). For other determination see text in the end of Sec. 3.

Figure 4: Forward–backward asymmetry \(A_{FB}\) for decay \(B\to K^{*}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) for GI parameters: (a)non–resonant and (b) and the sum of non–resonant and resonant contributions. Solid - SM, dashed - MSSM for \(1.2>R_{7\gamma}>0.4\), dotted - MSSM for \(-2.4>R_{7\gamma}>-4.2\), where \(R_{7\gamma}=C_{7\gamma}(M_{W})_{MSSM}/C_{7\gamma}(M_{W})_{SM}\) (see text in Sec.2 and Ref.8).
