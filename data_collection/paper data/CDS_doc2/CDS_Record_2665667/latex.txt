# Probing the \(\mathcal{CP}\) nature of the Higgs boson coupling to \(\tau\) leptons at HL-LHC

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

This note presents a study for the prospective measurement of the \(\mathcal{CP}\) quantum number of the Higgs boson coupling to \(\tau\) leptons with 3000 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV using the ATLAS detector at the HL-LHC. Only \(H\to\tau\tau\) events where both \(\tau\) leptons decay via the \(\tau^{\pm}\to\rho^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\to\pi^{0}\pi^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\) chain are analysed and the acoplanarity angle \(\varphi^{*}_{\mathcal{CP}}\), the angle between the planes spanned by the pion pairs, is used to determine the \(\mathcal{CP}\)-mixing angle. It is shown that considering only statistical uncertainties, a pseudoscalar Higgs boson can be excluded at 95% confidence level. The \(\mathcal{CP}\)-mixing angle can be measured with a statistical precision ranging between \(\pm 18^{\circ}\) and \(\pm 33^{\circ}\), depending on the precision of the \(\pi^{0}\) reconstruction.

## 1 Introduction

The nature of the spin-\(\mathcal{CP}\) state of the Higgs boson is a fundamental property which is expected to be tested at the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics predicts the Higgs boson to be a scalar (\(J^{\mathcal{CP}}=0^{++}\)) with no \(\mathcal{CP}\)-violating interactions. The measurement of a \(\mathcal{CP}\)-odd contribution in the Higgs boson couplings would constitute a discovery of physics beyond the SM. This note presents a prospect for testing the existence of \(\mathcal{CP}\)-odd interactions in the \(H\to\tau\tau\) decay within the context of the HL-LHC.

Measurements from ATLAS and CMS have searched for \(\mathcal{CP}\)-odd contributions in the Higgs boson couplings to gauge bosons, but so far all results show no deviations from the \(\mathcal{CP}\)-even SM prediction [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. These measurements, however, probe only the bosonic couplings in which \(\mathcal{CP}\)-odd contributions can enter only via higher order operators that are suppressed by powers of \(1/\Lambda^{2}\), where \(\Lambda\) is the scale of the new physics of an Effective Field Theory. The measurement of the Higgs boson's couplings to fermions are expected to yield higher sensitivity and be more model independent since \(\mathcal{CP}\)-odd terms can enter at the same order of the \(\mathcal{CP}\)-even terms of the Standard Model and are not suppressed by powers of \(1/\Lambda^{2}\). In a \(\mathcal{CP}\)-violating Lagrangian, the SM Yukawa term can be extended as

\[\mathcal{L}=g_{\tau\tau}(\cos(\phi_{\tau})\overline{\tau}\tau+\sin(\phi_{ \tau})\overline{\tau}i\gamma_{5}\tau)\,h, \tag{1}\]

where \(g_{\tau\tau}\) represents the overall coupling strength of the Higgs boson to \(\tau\) leptons, and the mixing parameter \(\phi_{\tau}\in(-\pi/2,\pi/2]\) determines the relative strengths of the \(\mathcal{CP}\)-even and \(\mathcal{CP}\)-odd interactions. The SM coupling corresponds to \(\phi_{\tau}=0\), while a maximally \(\mathcal{CP}\)-odd coupling is realised when \(\phi_{\tau}=\pi/2\). The mixing parameter \(\phi_{\tau}\) can be probed experimentally in the \(H\to\tau\tau\) decays via the correlations of the \(\tau\) leptons' spins. The orientations of the spins can be determined from the angular directions of the \(\tau\) decay products thanks to the maximally parity-violating nature of the decay. Ideally, the \(\tau\) momenta in the Higgs boson rest frame can be used to give maximal sensitivity to \(\phi_{\tau}\). However, the presence of two or more neutrinos in the final state prevents the reconstruction of these key kinematic variables. Among all decays, those where both \(\tau\) leptons decay hadronically are expected to retain the most sensitivity because only two neutrinos are produced.

Several proposals exist to attempt to measure the Higgs boson \(\mathcal{CP}\) state in \(H\to\tau\tau\) decays using different \(\tau\) decays and different experimental observables [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. While all decay modes can in principle be used, the \(\tau\) decays via \(\tau^{\pm}\to\rho^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\to\pi^{\pm}\pi^{0}\nu_{\tau}\) are particularly interesting. In these decays, the directions of the pions retain a strong correlation to the \(\tau\) spin direction and they allow for the construction of a simple observable, the acoplanarity angle \(\varphi_{\mathcal{CP}}^{*}\)[14]. This angle is defined by the two \(\tau\) decay planes spanned by the pion pairs, as shown in Fig. 1, in the rest frame of the vectorial sum of all the four pions. The distribution of \(\varphi_{\mathcal{CP}}^{*}\) is expected to have sinusoidal shape with a phase that varies linearly with \(\phi_{\tau}\). However, in order to observe such sinusoidal modulation, events need to be categorised based on the sign of the product \(y_{+}y_{-}\), where \(y_{\pm}=(E_{\pm}-E_{0})/(E_{\pm}+E_{0})\) are the asymmetries of the energies of the pions from each \(\tau\) decay. To remedy this, the \(\varphi_{\mathcal{CP}}^{*}\) in events with \(y_{+}y_{-}<0\) is shifted such that the maxima of the distribution match with the maxima of the distribution in events with \(y_{+}y_{-}>0\). For more details, see for instance Ref. [14]. In this study, only the \(\tau^{\pm}\to\rho^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\to\pi^{\pm}\pi^{0}\nu_{\tau}\) decays are analysed and these correspond to 25% of all the \(\tau\) decays and approximately 6% of all \(H\to\tau\tau\) decays [20]. The sensitivity estimated in this study is therefore based on a small fraction of \(H\to\tau\tau\) events (about 6%) and can be improved when more \(\tau\) decays are included.

At present, such measurement has never been performed as the available data is not sufficient. The purpose of this note is to test the viability of measuring \(\phi_{\tau}\) at the HL-LHC, which is expected to provide 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) ofproton-proton (\(pp\)) collision data at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. The expected signal and background yields are based on estimates from the measurement of the \(H\to\tau\tau\) cross-section with \(36.1\) fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV data [21]. As was the case for the study of the prospective measurement of the \(H\to\tau\tau\) coupling at the HL-LHC [22], the results presented in this note are based on predictions on the performance of the upgraded ATLAS detector, as detailed in Section 2. Furthermore, the uncertainties quoted in the results account solely for the statistical uncertainties of the expected data sample.

## 2 Modelling of Signal and Background Events

The \(H\to\tau\tau\) decays analysed in this study are simulated at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV with a setup similar to the one implemented in Ref. [21], using Powheg[23; 24; 25; 26; 27] for the matrix element generation and Pythia for the parton shower modeling [28]. Both the gluon-gluon fusion (ggH) and the vector boson fusion (VBF) modes are considered for the Higgs boson production, while only the \(\tau^{\pm}\to\rho^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\to\pi^{\pm}\pi^{0}\nu_{\tau}\) decays are simulated.

In order to produce events with different \(\phi_{\tau}\), the \(H\to\tau\tau\) decay is simulated without accounting for the \(\tau\) spin correlations. Event weights are then computed with the TauSpinner program [29] for each of the analysed values of \(\phi_{\tau}\). Couplings of the Higgs boson to all other particles are assumed to be as predicted in the SM. The expected signal yields are estimated as detailed in Sec. 4.

The simulation of the signal events is performed at particle level and does not include the full simulation of the detector response. Rather, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) components of the particle four-momenta are smeared by gaussian distributions to account for the expected resolutions of the upgraded ATLAS detector. For charged pions, the resolutions are parameterised according to performance functions which are derived from studies of simulated events which have passed a Geant 4 simulation [30] of the upgraded detector [31]. More details can be found in Ref. [22]. Neutral pions are smeared according to the core resolution, as estimated with a full simulation of the ATLAS detector at the LHC Run-1 [32], with a single gaussian independent of the neutral pion transverse momentum. HL-LHC simulation studies show that the \(\pi^{0}\)\(p_{\rm T}\) and directional core resolutions in correctly reconstructed decays, do not degrade in pileup of \(<\mu>\sim 200\) by more than a few percent compared to Run-1. However, scenarios with worse resolutions are also considered, since this resolution is expected to have a leading effect on the precision of \(\varphi^{*}_{C\mathcal{P}}\) reconstruction. The expected \(\varphi^{*}_{C\mathcal{P}}\) distributions in signal events for 1.0, 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 times the nominal resolutions are shown in Fig. 2. The resulting worsening of the resolution in \(\varphi^{*}_{C\mathcal{P}}\) manifests as a reduction in the amplitude of the sinusoidal modulation. However, no bias on the phase of the modulation is seen. The momenta of jets and of the missing transverse energy, that are used in the classification of the simulated signal events, are smeared based on the expected performance of the upgraded ATLAS detector [33].

The two main sources of background events are the \(Z\to\tau\tau\) decays and the multi-jet events where jets are misidentified as the visible products of a hadronically decaying \(\tau\) lepton (\(\tau_{\rm had}\)). Other SM processes yield contributions that are small in the range of reconstructed \(m_{\tau\tau}\) mass between 100 and 140 GeV and are safely neglected in this study.

The \(Z\to\tau\tau\) events are expected to produce a uniform \(\varphi^{*}_{C\mathcal{P}}\) distribution [34] and no effects from reconstruction or event selections are expected to induce any modulation. The misidentified \(\tau_{\rm had}\) background is also expected to be flat with respect to \(\varphi^{*}_{C\mathcal{P}}\). Therefore, in this study both these background contributions are estimated to be uniformly distributed in \(\varphi^{*}_{C\mathcal{P}}\). Their yields are estimated via extrapolations from the \(H\to\tau\tau\) measurement at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV [21], as detailed in Sec. 4.

## 3 Event Selection

As the \(\mathcal{C}\mathcal{P}\) state of the Higgs boson has no significant effect on the overall kinematics of the Higgs boson nor on the acceptance of the \(\tau\) decay products, this study uses the same object and event selections used for the measurement of the \(H\to\tau\tau\) cross-section with 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV collisions [21]. Also, since the decay of the Higgs boson can be factorised from its production, measurements of \(\phi_{\tau}\) in event categories targeting the VBF and ggH productions can be combined. The Run-2 event selection is expected to be achievable since the \(p_{\rm T}\) thresholds of the online and offline selections of the \(\tau_{\rm had}\) candidates at the HL-LHC are expected to be similar to those used during the LHC Run-2 [35]. In the following, the selection of the \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV analysis that is used as baseline for the estimate of the signal and background yields is described. The extrapolation of these yields from the \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV measurement to the dataset considered in this study is detailed in Section 4.

Events with two opposite-charge \(\tau_{\rm had}\) candidates with transverse momentum above 40 and 30 GeV are selected [32]. These \(\tau_{\rm had}\) candidates are required to be reconstructed with one charged and one neutral pion. Events are also required to have one jet candidate with a transverse momentum above 70 GeV. The selected events are assigned to event categories targeting either the VBF production or the ggH production where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a jet. These are the "VBF" and the "Boosted" categories, respectively, as described in Table 1. The VBF categories require the presence of a second jet in the event and the pair of jets needs to fulfil a set of requirements to match the VBF topology. The Boosted categories include all events that fail the VBF selections and that pass selections on the di-\(\tau_{\rm had}\) system. More details can be found in Ref. [21].

This selection is optimised for the measurement of the Higgs boson coupling to \(\tau\) leptons in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV including all the \(\tau\) decays and using the reconstructed \(m_{\tau\tau}\) mass as discriminating variable. The event selections may be reoptimised when taking into account: effects from the higher collision energy, the different signal-to-background purities for the exclusive \(\tau\) decay analysed in this study and for the selected \(m_{\tau\tau}\) range around the signal peak. Moreover, detector effects on the resolution of the signal-to-background purities are also included in the analysis.

Figure 2: Expected \(\varphi^{*}_{\mathcal{CP}}\) distribution in signal events in each of the signal regions (Section 3) for different hypotheses on the resolution of the \(\pi^{0}\) reconstruction. To better visualise the amplitudes and phases of the modulation, the distributions are fitted with the function \(A\cdot\cos(x+B)+C\). Statistical uncertainties on the simulated signal samples are shown.

\(\varphi^{*}_{\mathcal{CP}}\) observable may motivate the need for a different event categorisation, but also this optimisation is not considered in this study. Finally, the larger coverage of the tracking system, which will increase the acceptance of \(\tau\) leptons from \(|\eta|<2.5\) to \(|\eta|<4\), is not exploited in this study.

## 4 Extrapolation Methodology

The measurement of the \(H\to\tau\tau\) cross-section with 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(\sqrt{s}=13\)  data [21] forms the basis for the expected yields used in this note. The difference in the luminosity is accounted for with a multiplicative factor of 3000/36.1 = 83.1. Corrections for the increase in cross-sections between \(\sqrt{s}=14\)  (for the HL-LHC) and \(\sqrt{s}=13\)  (for the current dataset), are derived identically to a study of the prospects for a \(H\to\tau\tau\) cross-section measurement at the HL-LHC [22].

With respect to the event selections used in Ref. [21] to analyse events with two \(\tau_{\rm had}\) candidates, there are two main differences which are accounted for when estimating the signal and background yields used in this note. First, the cross-section measurement is performed on the entire range of the reconstructed \(m_{\tau\tau}\) mass of the Higgs boson candidate [36], since the \(m_{\tau\tau}\) mass is used as the discriminating variable. In contrast, this study analyses only events within the \(m_{\tau\tau}\) mass window 100-140   in order to reduce background contributions, in particular from \(Z\to\tau\tau\) events. Second, in Ref. [21] all the \(\tau\) decays are included, while this study is performed only with \(\tau_{\rm had}\) candidates reconstructed with one charged and one neutral pion. To address both issues, signal and background event yields are taken from Ref. [21] requiring both the mass window selection and that reconstructed \(\tau_{\rm had}\) candidates contain one charged and one neutral pion. Such yields are then scaled to account for the increased luminosity and cross sections at the HL-LHC. Effects from the higher collision energy or the higher pileup on yields and acceptances in the difference signal regions are not accounted for.

The background contributions are estimated using these event yields and assuming flat distributions in \(\varphi^{*}_{\mathcal{CP}}\)[34]. The signal contributions also use these yields but the distributions in \(\varphi^{*}_{\mathcal{CP}}\) are obtained from a smearing of the particle-level simulation of the signal events with only \(\tau^{\pm}\to\rho^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\to\pi^{\pm}\pi^{0}\nu_{\tau}\) decays, as described in Section 2. That means that signal events are modelled assuming all selected \(\tau\) decays to be correctly reconstructed with one neutral and one charged pion. Effects from mis-reconstructed \(\tau\)

decays are not taken into account. HL-LHC simulations indicate that about 65% of the \(\tau_{\rm had}\) candidates with one neutral and one charged pion are correctly reconstructed \(\tau\) decays. The rest is from decays with one charged and zero neutral pions, where one neutral pion originates from pileup, or from decays with one charged and two or more neutral pions. Both types of mis-reconstruction are expected to contribute a uniform \(\varphi^{*}_{CP}\) distribution. To match the Run-2 \(\tau_{\rm had}\) reconstruction acceptance, simulated charged and neutral pions are required to have \(p_{\rm T}>1\) GeV and \(p_{\rm T}>2.7\) GeV, respectively. The simulated signal events are categorised based on the smeared particle momenta.

The expected signal and background yields are presented in Table 2 and a summary plot of all regions is presented in Fig. 3.

The lower panel shows the ratio of the signal plus background yield over the background yield. Uncertainties account only for the statistical uncertainties of the expected data sample.

## 5 Statistical Analysis

A maximum likelihood estimator is utilised to test the sensitivity of the measurement of the \(\phi_{\tau}\) mixing angle. For each \(\phi_{\tau}\) hypothesis, a binned likelihood is constructed from the expected \(\varphi^{*}_{C\mathcal{P}}\) distributions in each of the five signal regions defined in Section 3. The likelihood is a function of the expected data yields in all the signal regions and of the signal strength \(\mu\), which is the ratio of the signal yield over the expected SM yield. The expected data is created as the sum of the expected \(Z\to\tau\tau\) and misidentified \(\tau_{\rm had}\) background contributions and of the signal events under the scalar hypothesis. A fit is performed under each \(\phi_{\tau}\) hypothesis minimising the negative log likelihood (NLL) and the best-fit \(\phi_{\tau}\) value is determined as the one that yields the lowest NLL. The distribution of \(\Delta\mathrm{NLL}=\mathrm{NLL}(\phi_{\tau})-\mathrm{NLL}_{\rm min}\) values is presented in Fig. 4 for different scenarios of \(\pi^{0}\) resolutions. The \(\Delta\mathrm{NLL}\) curve shows that the pseudoscalar hypothesis can be excluded at more than 95% confidence level even with a \(\pi^{0}\) resolution as large as 1.5 times the nominal one. The mixing angle \(\phi_{\tau}\) can be measured at 68% confidence level with a statistical precision of approximately \(\pm 18^{\circ}\) and \(\pm 33^{\circ}\) assuming the nominal or a twice as large \(\pi^{0}\) resolution, respectively.

## 6 Conclusions

A prospect of measuring the \(C\mathcal{P}\) quantum number of the Higgs boson in its decay to \(\tau\) lepton pairs with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collision data at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the HL-LHC is presented. The study tests the viability of utilising the \(H\to\tau\tau\) decays where both \(\tau\) leptons decay via \(\tau^{\pm}\to\rho^{\pm}\nu\tau\to\pi^{\pm}\pi^{0}\nu_{\tau}\). Expected signal and background yields are based on prospects for the measurement of the Higgs boson couplings to \(\tau\) leptons at the HL-LHC [22] and on the measurement at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV [21]. The precision in the reconstruction of charged and neutral pions are based on the expected performance of the upgraded ATLAS detector and on the full simulation of the ATLAS detector in the LHC Run-1, respectively. Given the strong effect that the precision of the \(\pi^{0}\) reconstruction is

Figure 4: \(\Delta\mathrm{NLL}\) distributions computed for different scenarios of \(\pi^{0}\) resolution. The \(\phi_{\tau}\) value at which the \(\Delta\mathrm{NLL}\) curve intersects the dashed red and blue lines correspond to the 68% and 95% confidence intervals, respectively.

expected to have in this analysis, scenarios with different \(\pi^{0}\) resolutions are considered. Furthermore, only statistical uncertainties on the expected data sample are accounted for.

Even with \(\pi^{0}\) resolutions 1.5 times as large as during Run-2, it is expected that the pseudoscalar hypothesis can be excluded at \(2\sigma\) analysing only the \(H\to\tau\tau\) decays where both \(\tau\) leptons decay via \(\tau^{\pm}\to\rho^{\pm}\nu\tau\to\pi^{\pm}\pi^{0}\nu_{\tau}\) (about 6% of the \(H\to\tau\tau\) events). The mixing angle \(\phi_{\tau}\) can be measured at 68% confidence level with a statistical precision of approximately \(\pm 18^{\circ}\) and \(\pm 33^{\circ}\) assuming the nominal or a twice as large \(\pi^{0}\) resolution, respectively.
