###### Abstract

Measurements of attenuation in double clad WLS fiber Y11(200)MS [1] have been carried out using blue LED source and angular positioning of photo-detector. Data obtained for the external polar angle range up to 60\({}^{\circ}\) allowed to separate the bulk attenuation and reflection in-efficiencies for the fiber core and core-clad1 interface as well as for clad1 - clad2 one.

The fibers of this type have been used for the optical instrumentation of Tile Hadron Calorimeter of ATLAS project [2].

## 1 Introduction

The WLS double clad fibers provide readout of blue light emitting scintillating plates of calorimeter with subsequent light re-emission in green wave length range using 3HF type shifter(3-hydroxyflavone) implemented in the core material. Part of the light, re-emitted through the shifting mechanism, is transported to the remote photo-detector through internal reflections undergoing an attenuation losses which may be decomposed into "bulk" one having mainly Rayleigh diffuse scattering nature and reflection in-efficiency due to non-perfectness of core-clad1 and clad1-clad2 interfaces. The optical properties of Y11(200)MS fiber have been mainly studied in geometry of the practical use in calorimeter, at the air contact of fiber exit with photo-multiplier allowing to sum over wide angular range of output light. The single date on average attenuation length obtained for this geometry doesn't allow to separate a mentioned components of attenuation and there is the need in angular measurements. In the recent paper [3] devoted to attenuation study in double clad WLS fibers of different producers, including Y11(200)MS one, an idea of exploiting a geometry of different distances between fiber output and photo-detector has been realized. Similar approach has also been proposed and realized earlier [4] for study of attenuation in plastic scintillating plates. Using this approach the core's bulk attenuation and average in-efficiency of reflections in core-clad 1 and clad 1-clad 2 interfaces were determined [3].

In this paper we present the results of direct measurement of attenuation's angular dependence allowing to separate and determine the core's bulk attenuation and angular dependence of reflections' in-efficiency for core -clad 1 interface as well as to subtract it for clad 1-clad 2 one averaged over angular range measured.

The preliminary results have been presented in [5].

Light attenuation in WLS double clad fiber

Structure of double clad fiber Y11(200)MS consists of polystyrene core, with refractive index \(n_{1}\)=1.58 and 950 \(\mu\)m in diameter, 20-30 \(\mu\)m thick clad 1 and clad 2 with \(n_{2}\)=1.49 (polymethylmethacrylate(PMMA)) and \(n_{3}\)=1.42 (fluorinated PMMA) respectively. Coordinate systems and notations are shown in Fig.1 for the general case of non-axial rays, where internal reflection angle \(\alpha\) in core-clad 1 interface is defined as a:

\[\alpha=arc\cos\{\sin\theta[1-\left(r_{c}/r\right)^{2}\sin^{2}\varphi]^{1/2}\} \tag{1}\]

and condition of the full internal reflection as a:

\[\sin\theta[1-\left(r_{c}/r\right)^{2}\sin^{2}\varphi]^{1/2}\leq\left(1-n_{21}^ {2}\right)^{1/2}\;, \tag{2}\]

where \(n_{21}\) denotes the ratio of clad 1 to core refractive indexes and \(r\), \(r_{c}\) are the core radius and distance from the ray trace to the fiber center respectively. Similar expression may be written for clad1-clad 2 interface.

Figure 1: Coordinate system

Light propagation in fiber is accompanied by bulk attenuation and reflection inefficiencies leading to the intensity decrease:

\[I/I_{0}=\rho^{N}\,\exp(-z/\lambda\,\cos\theta)\, \tag{3}\]

where \(\rho=(1-\varepsilon)\) is the reflection efficiency (\(\varepsilon\) -inefficiency one), out of geometrical optics relations, \(\lambda\) is the bulk attenuation length and N is the reflections number that may be written as a \(N=z\tan\theta/2{(r^{2}-r_{e}^{2})}^{1/2}=n(\theta)z\), where \(\texttt{n}(\theta)\) is the reflection number per length unit along the fiber axe.

Expression (3), within assumption of \(\varepsilon\)'s smallness may be replaced by single exponent:

\[I/I_{0}=\exp(-z(1/\lambda\,\cos\theta+n(\theta)\varepsilon(\theta)))\, \tag{4}\]

where reflection inefficiency \(\varepsilon\) is in general angular dependent and both \(\varepsilon\) and \(\lambda\) depend also of the light wavelength.

The experimental bulk attenuation (\(1/\lambda\)) is in general a convolution of wavelength dependent bulk attenuation itself with WLS fiber emission and photo-detector sensitivity spectra. So the variation of those parameters may cause the change in the "attenuation" length measured. In particular the use of photomultipliers with green extended cathode will essentially increase the measured transparency of WLS fibers.

As it is seen from expression (4) a separation of both attenuation components may be done exploiting their different angular dependence.

However, the placement of photo-detector at fixed external polar angle corresponds to spectrum of internal reflection ones (1), so a detailed Monte-Carlo assistance within geometrical optics is needed for correct application of expression (4) (see section 4 for details).

Experimental setup and method

The sketch of experimental setup is shown in Fig.2. As a light source the blue light diode with emission maximum at 400\(\pm\)30 nm has been chosen for its closest to the emission maxima of blew scintillators (420-450 nm). As a photo-detector a photo-multiplier tube XP2012B with spectral sensitivity in the 300-600nm range has been used. PMT's signal has been integrated and obtained DC output measured by ADC.

The fibers, taken from Tile Hadron Calorimeter Instrumentation area at CERN, have been cutted to the length of 140 cm. Their ends have been carefully polished and tested for optical quality by transmission of collimated red laser light (\(\geq\)600 nm) which could not be shifted by WLS mechanism to the spectral range of PMT sensitivity. The angular distribution at the exit of the fiber has been measured with good resolution using vertical slit at the photo-cathode position and maximal permitted voltage on PMT aimed to increase its sensitivity. The standard deviation of app.1.5\({}^{\circ}\) has been obtained by means of Gaussian fit.

The black rubber mask has then been installed on photo-cathode providing resolution of \(\pm\)1.5\({}^{\circ}\) for external polar angle. After this procedure one of the

Figure 2: Sketch of experimental setup

fiber ends has been blackened and fibers preliminary scanned at \(\theta^{ext}\) =0\({}^{\circ}\) for the quality test. Four fibers having comparatively few problems with surface damage and showing relatively smooth variation of light yield with z have been selected.

Two sets of measurements have been carried out, without and with green filter installed on photo-cathode. The green filter usage had the following sense: with transmission maximum at appr.530 nm and bandwidth from 440 to 620 nm it provides mainly cut of the short waves range having relatively high bulk attenuation. As a consequence the measured transparency is noticeably increased, so the green filter acts similar to green extension of photo-cathode (Fig. 3).

Measurements of attenuation have been done by the z-scan with angle step of 3\(\div\)5\({}^{\circ}\) for external angles up to 43\({}^{\circ}\) while the angular measurements of light yield at fixed z until 60\({}^{\circ}\). Data of z-scan have been fitted by single exponent at starting point of 60-70 cm or two exponents at the lower z-start. Practically no difference have been found for the values of the effective attenuation

\[1/\lambda_{eff}(\theta)=1/\lambda\,\cos\theta+n(\theta)\varepsilon(\theta) \tag{5}\]

in both cases.

Need in the short length attenuation describing the losses at the first 50 cm even for angular range of core propagation (\(\theta\leq 18^{\circ}\)) is mainly due to strong bulk attenuation of short wavelengths and great sensitivity of photo-detector response to this spectral range [6]. Partly it is also due to contribution of light rays propagating in core and clad1 regions with bigger \(\theta\) (\(\geq 18^{\circ}\)) and consequently with higher frequency of reflections and exiting fiber end in the zone of clad1-air interface with the same \(\theta^{ext}\). However this contribution is evaluated to be relatively small at \(\theta^{ext}\leq 30^{\circ}\).

## 4 Data analysis and results

### Propagation in core region

Results of attenuation angular measurements of \(\lambda_{eff}\) in the core region (\(\theta\leq 18^{\circ}\)) are shown in Fig.4 for one of the fibers for the green filter case. There is clearly seen an attenuation length decrease mostly attributed to the increase in the reflections' number since the total path of the rays determining the size of the bulk attenuation is slowly varied as a \(1/\cos\theta\). For reflection inefficiency contribution the polar angle dependence in general is more complex except axial ray's trajectories. As it has been mentioned above in sec.2 each polar angle \(\theta(\theta^{ext})\) corresponds to spectrum of reflection angles \(\alpha\) in core-clad1 interface according to expression (1).

Data of Monte-Carlo simulation for \(\alpha\) distributions are shown in Fig.5 for the six fixed values of \(\theta^{ext}\) between 5 and \(30^{\circ}\). As it is seen from figure, distributions are peaked at minimal reflection angle \(\alpha^{min}=90^{\circ}-\theta\) and extended to the maximal value of \(90^{\circ}\). Distributions are broadened with \(\theta\) increase and strongly overlapped, creating the problem of angular identification. To solve this problem the subtraction procedure has been developed, consisting of following stages:

- The bulk attenuation has been determined first for each fiber using data at \(\theta^{ext}=0^{\circ}\).The contribution of reflection in-efficiency is evaluated to be less than \(1\%\) for \(\varepsilon\sim 10^{-4}\) at this angle and therefore neglected.

- The average number of reflections \(N(\theta)\) has been calculated at each external angle \(\theta^{ext}_{i}\) over the corresponding \(\alpha\)'s range shown in Fig.5 and the average reflection in-efficiency \(\varepsilon(\theta^{ext}_{i})\) determined according to (5) using the bulk attenuation length obtained.

- With results on \(\varepsilon(\theta^{ext}_{i})\) obtained, subtraction of \(\varepsilon(\alpha)\) values for narrow angular interval around \(\alpha^{min}\) is realized according to following iterative algo

rithm:

\[\varepsilon(\alpha_{i})=\varepsilon(\theta_{i}^{ext})-\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}\varepsilon( \alpha_{j})\,\omega_{j} \tag{6}\]

started at \(\theta^{ext}=\) 5\({}^{\circ}\) (i=1) until \(\theta^{ext}=\) 30\({}^{\circ}\) (i=6),where \(\omega_{j}\) is a calculated weight of each \(\alpha_{i}\)- th interval of \(\alpha\)-spectrum at fixed \(\theta_{j}^{ext}\) (Fig. 5). Thus one obtains:

\[\varepsilon(\alpha_{1})=\varepsilon(\theta_{1}^{ext}),\;\varepsilon(\alpha_{2 })=\varepsilon(\theta_{2}^{ext})-\varepsilon(\alpha_{1})\omega_{1}\;\text{et al,}.\]

Data for attenuation length \(\lambda\) and \(\varepsilon\) (\(\alpha\)) are presented in Table 1 and shown in Fig. 6, averaged over all fibers' data, assuming the same reflection in-efficiency at individual bulk attenuation lengths. This assumption seems is reasonable due to different mechanisms of both attenuations and is also justified by relatively great and compatible errors in \(\varepsilon\) (\(\alpha\)) data (20 to 80%) as compared to bulk attenuation ones (app. 1.2 to 1.4%).

As a common feature there is clearly seen an increase in \(\varepsilon(\alpha)\) with \(\alpha\) decrease giving practically coincident results for non-filtered and filtered cases, while for bulk attenuation length a noticeable difference has been observed.

Assuming that the origin of the light losses in reflection corresponds to the small diffusing spots in core-clad1 interface, one may explain an observed angular dependence in terms of visible surface, driven by \(\cos(\alpha)\)[7] where angle is defined between the normal to the surface and incident rays direction.

Data in Fig.6 as it is seen are fairly well described within this assumption. Results presented may be compared to the data of [3] (0.6 \(\div\)1.3)\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\), obtained for the best samples of different producers and attributed to the extracted average of \(\varepsilon\) over the core propagation angular range.

Assuming angular independence of \(\varepsilon\) and taking it as a parameter we may fit the data on \(\lambda_{eff}(\theta)\) in Fig.4 according to expression (5), using Monte-Carlo calculations of \(N(\theta)\). As it is seen from figure, in general fit reproduces satisfactory the behavior of \(\lambda_{eff}(\theta)\) giving a reasonable values for \(\lambda\) and \(\varepsilon\)(402\(\pm\)4 cm and (6.8\(\pm\)0.8)\(\times\)10\({}^{-5}\) respectively). However the quality of the

description(\(\chi^{2}/n\)) is not good so angular dependence of \(\varepsilon\) should be taken into account.

### Propagation in core \(\&\) clad1 region

Three values of angular setting have been used for this study at \(\theta^{ext}=33\), \(38\) and \(43^{\circ}\) (\(\theta=20.2\), \(22.9\), \(25.6^{\circ}\) and \(\theta_{cl1}=5.5\), \(12.4\), \(17^{\circ}\) are correspondingly angles in core and clad1 zones respectively). Transition from pure core region(\(\theta\leq 18.44^{\circ}\)) to the zone of combined core-clad1 propagation requires an introduction of new missing parameters describing a bulk attenuation in clad 1, reflection and penetration in-efficiencies in core-clad1, clad1-core and clad 1-clad 2 interfaces. To simplify the situation and reduce the number of missing parameters the following assumptions are made:

a. The bulk attenuation length of clad1, made of PMMA, is much more than in polystyrene core(see f.e. data of [8]). From the other hand the total path in clad1 is much less as compared to the core one, so by these two reasons the bulk attenuation in clad1 is neglected.

b. The angular dependence of reflection inefficiency \(\varepsilon\) (\(\alpha\)) for core-clad1 interface might be extrapolated to the range of \(64^{\circ}\leq\alpha\leq 72^{\circ}\) according to fit in the region of \(\alpha\geq 72^{\circ}\).

c. The angular dependence of reflection inefficiency \(\varepsilon(\alpha)\) for the internal part of clad1-core interface is determined by the same dependence for the external part one (clad 1-core).

Within these assumptions the one missing parameter remains: a reflection in-efficiency of clad1-clad2 interface. Measured attenuation in this angular range might be written similar to expression (5):

\[1/\lambda_{eff}(\theta)=1/\lambda\,\cos\theta+n_{c}(\theta)\varepsilon_{c-cl1} (\theta)w_{c}+n_{el}(\theta)w_{cl}[\varepsilon_{cl1-c}(\theta)+\varepsilon_{ cl1-cl2}(\theta)] \tag{7}\]Where:

* \(n_{c}\), \(n_{cl}\) and \(w_{c}\), \(w_{d}\)- are the average numbers of reflections per unit of fiber length and the fractional weights of events for rays propagating in pure core or mixed core-clad1 regions at fixed \(\theta^{ext}\).
* \(\varepsilon_{e-cl1}\), \(\varepsilon_{cl1-c}\) and \(\varepsilon_{cl1-cl2}\) are the reflection inefficiencies for core-clad1, clad1-core and clad1-clad2 interfaces respectively. Notation \(\varepsilon_{e-cl1}\) used here for convenience instead of \(\varepsilon\) in previous sections.

Due to smaller number of measured points in this angular range, subtraction procedure(6) has not been applied and results are obtained in assumption of angular independence of \(\varepsilon_{cl1-cl2}\). Corresponding values averaged over the four fibers are \((1.3\pm 0.2)\times 10^{-4}\) and: \((2.1\pm 0.3)\times 10^{-4}\) for the filtered and non-filtered cases respectively. Observed difference shows some sensitivity of clad1-clad2 interface to the light wavelength as compared to the core-clad1 case. Data of [3] obtained for \(\varepsilon_{cl1-ct2}\) result to higher values \((3\div 4)\times 10^{-4}\) for the best cases.

### Angular measurements at fixed source position and comparison with Monte-Carlo simulation

Angular dependence of the fiber light yield at fixed source position (90 cm from PM tube) has been simulated using obtained data for bulk attenuation and reflection inefficiency. Distributions for non-filtered and filtered cases are similar, so Fig.7 shows the data for filtered case at external polar angles up to \(60^{\circ}\). Results of Monte-Carlo simulations are shown as for full light yield as well as for contribution of clad1 separately.

As it is seen from figure there is observed a fairly well agreement between experimental data and simulation results almost in whole angular range except angles above \(45^{\circ}\) where experimental data are higher than simulation Figure 7: Angular dependence of the fiber light yield: Experimental data and MC simulation results

have been separated and determined for core, core-clad1 and clad1-clad2 interfaces respectively.

A visible angular dependence of \(\varepsilon_{c-d1}\) has been observed and described by contribution of light diffusing mechanism. No noticeable difference in values of \(\varepsilon_{c-cl1}\) has been seen between non-filtered and green filtered light spectra, while it reaches app.40% for the values of attenuation lengths. Some spectral sensitivity is also seen in \(\varepsilon_{cl1-cl2}\) values averaged over corresponding angular range. Experimental data on the light yield angular dependence are fairly well agreed with Monte-Carlo simulation, based on the results for \(\lambda\), \(\varepsilon_{c-cl1}\) and \(\varepsilon_{cl1-cl2}\) obtained.
