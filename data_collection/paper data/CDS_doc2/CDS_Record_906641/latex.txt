###### Abstract

This paper contains the results of the analyses done on the following electron Tilecal test-beam data: 20 GeV electrons - June 2003 (\(\eta\) scan, \(\pm 20^{\circ}\) scan, \(\pm 90^{\circ}\) "tile" scan) and 180 GeV electrons - August 2003 (\(\eta\) scan). Correction of the position dependence was applied. A Gaussian distribution was fitted to the corrected spectrum and as result the values of the calibration constant and the resolution were obtained. Fit method of the cell signal reconstruction was used.

## 1 Introduction

In June 2003 the Barrel module labelled "JINR 12" was tested. On the top there were two Extended Barrel modules labelled "ANL 03" and "ANL 23". During August 2003 instead of two Extended Barrel modules there was one more Barrel module. The middle module was "JINR 63" and the top module was "JINR 13".

At the beginning of this paper two classes of used selection cuts are described. The first class (the "Beam cuts") ensures the proper beam parameters. The second class of cuts (the "Electron separation cuts") was applied in order to get rid of non-electron beam contamination. Then the observed position dependence of the electron response is shown and the way of applying corrections of this effect is described. Finally, the results of the analyses are presented.

The EM shower is narrow and therefore we restricted the calculations only to cells in relatively small area around the beam direction. By such restriction we avoided adding of noise to the signal. For \(\eta\) scan we chose to sum the region 3 \(\times\) 3 \(\times\) 3 cells in \(\eta\)\(\times\phi\)\(\times\)\(D\)1. For other runs we chose approximately equivalent area.

## 2 Beam cuts

### Cuts on the S1 and S3 scintillators signal

We applied cuts to select the events for which the signal from S1 and S3 scintillators corresponds to a MIP signal. We excluded events with too low or too high signal. One of the explanations of the too low signal can be that the incidental particle did not cross the scintillator. On the other hand, too high signal can be caused, for instance, by two particles crossing the scintillator during very short time.

We used following algorithm to set the lower and the upper bounds for rejecting or admitting an event. For each scintillator (S1 and S2) we fitted a Landau distribution to its spectrum. Then we set the lower bound on \(MPV-3.5\,\sigma\) and the upper bound on \(MPV+8\,\sigma\), where \(MPV\) (Most Probable Value) and \(\sigma\) are the parameters obtained from the fit (see Figures 1 and 2).

We used this algorithm as an systematic rule for setting the bounds instead of setting them "by hand". For this reason its sufficient to use only the Landau distribution instead of using the convolution of Gaussian and Landau distribution. This approach sets the bounds satisfyingly and saves computing time.

### Beam Geometry Delimitation Cuts - 20 GeV

For most of the beam particles, their trajectory leads close to the center of the beam and the direction of their movement is parallel to the beam axis. For such particles we can rely on that they have the proper energy (in our case 20 GeV or 180 GeV). There is significant amount of particles whose trajectories are far from the beam axis and/or are deflected from the straight direction. For these particles the energy is not well defined. Moreover, it can happen that their impact position on the face of the module is far from the desired position (for instance, far from the cell center).

We already restricted the distance between the beam center and the trajectory of the particle by using S1 and S3 scintillator cuts. This restriction is a consequence of the limited size of the scintillators, but this is not a very strong restriction condition.

For additional restrictions we utilized the information from the two beam chambers. We restricted the angle between the beam axis and the particle trajectory. After we applied the cut on the angle, only one common cut is needed to restrict satisfyingly the impact position on the face of the module and the distance of the trajectory from the beam axis. For this purpose we chose to use a impact position cut. In Figure 3 is a contour plot which shows the surface density of the impact points on the face of the module. We excluded events outside the rectangular area (see Figure 3) from the analysis. We set the size of the rectangular area "by hand".

Figure 2: S3 scintillator spectrum fitted by landau distribution. The events in between the vertical lines are admitted. (run r0330401, \(\eta=-0.65\))

### Beam Geometry Delimitation Cuts - 180 GeV

Since the 180 GeV beam has smaller spread we used ellipsoidal area instead of the rectangular area with borders set "by hand" shown in Figure 3. We found the position and dimension parameters of this ellipsoidal area by fitting two dimensional Gaussian to the surface density of impact points on the front face of the module. Then the center of the border ellipse corresponds to the position of the Gaussian maximum; the length of the semimajor and semiminor axis is \(2.3\,\sigma_{x}\) and \(2.3\,\sigma_{y}\) respectively, where \(\sigma_{x}\) and \(\sigma_{y}\) are the 2D Gaussian \(\sigma\)s. Figure 4 shows the surface density of impact points and the border ellipse. The events inside the ellipse were admitted.

## 3 Electron separation cuts - 20 GeV

The beams for measurements of the electron responses are far from "pure electron beams". They contain large amount of muons and pions. In order to get rid of the contamination by muons and pions we applied several electron separation cuts.

Figure 3: Beam Geometry Delimitation Cuts - 20 GeV. Contour plot of the surface density of the impact points on the face of the module. The plot contains only events which successfully pass the S1 and S2 scintillators cuts and the angle cut. (run r0330401, \(\eta=-0.65\))One of the quantities which we use for electron identification was the ratio \(w_{1}\):

\[w_{1}=\frac{R_{imp}}{R_{imp}+\sum\limits_{j}R_{j}} \tag{1}\]

where \(R_{imp}\) is the response of the impact cell2. In the denominator is the response of the impact cell plus the sum over the responses of all cells in the second sampling (depth). Then we can distinguish electrons from muons and pions, as the electrons lose large fraction of their energy already in the first sampling. We consider events for which the value of \(w_{1}\) is above some bound to be electron events. For different impact angles the particular value of the bound slightly changes. This is due to the fact that for different angles the effective thickness of the first sampling is different. The typical border values of \(w_{1}\) were between 0.8 and 0.9.

Footnote 2: \(R\) will always denote the signal from the given cell (i.e. sum of the signals of the two PMTs, which provide the read-out of this cell).

This cut is useful at the beginning of the procedure of applying the position dependence correction (see Section 4). It helps to separate electrons before applying the position dependence correction. By using this cut we get better starting position for applying the position dependence correction. After applying the correction the other two electron separation cuts (which are described in next paragraphs) are doing their job very well and then

Figure 4: Beam Geometry Delimitation Cuts - 180 GeV. Contour plot of the surface density of the impact points on the face of the module. The plot contains only events which successfully pass the S1 and S2 scintillators cuts and the angle cut. 2D Gaussian fit parameters and the border ellipse are also shown.(run r0360448, \(\eta=-0.65\))

there is no need of using the cut based on \(w_{1}\) any longer. When we apply the other two electron separation cuts there are no events which do pass those two cuts, but do not pass the cut based on \(w_{1}\).

Figure 5 shows the \(w_{1}\) distribution.

Another quantity, which can be used for electron separation, on the basis of the different longitudinal profile of the EM and hadronic showers, is (according to [1]) \(w_{2}\):

\[w_{2}=\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^{2}\sum_{selected\ i}R_{ik} \tag{2}\]

where K is constant factor in GeV and the index \(k\) denotes the sampling number (\(k=1\) is the first radial sampling). The second sum runs only over the cells within the region 3 \(\times\) 3 cells in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) around the impact cell.

If for given event the value of \(w_{2}\) is higher than some border value, then the particle is considered to be an electron. However, for the distributions of \(w_{2}\) for most of the runs it is not sufficiently clear where the border is (see Figure 6). The situation is worse for higher values of \(|\eta|\). This is due to the fact that the effective thickness of the first two samplings grows with the growing absolute value of \(\eta\) and thus the difference in \(w_{2}\) between electrons and pions obliterates. To determine the border value of \(w_{2}\) we used the plot which is shown in Figure 7. This plot also includes information from the Cherenkov counter3.

Footnote 3: The Cherenkov counter used in H8-beamline is usually able to provide up to 20 GeV electron-pion separation with good efficiency. However, for runs we analysed, this was not

Figure 5: The histogram shows the distribution of \(w_{1}\). The electron events are on the right of the vertical border line. (run r0330401, \(\eta=-0.65\)).

In addition to the selection condition related directly to the value of \(w_{2}\), we added one more condition. This additional condition is related to the fact that for electrons not only the value of \(w_{2}\) is higher, but also the response of the Cherenkov counter is higher. More specifically, the condition is:

\[w_{2}\,>\,\kappa_{2}\times(Cher1)+\epsilon_{2} \tag{3}\]

where \(\kappa_{2}<0\). We determined the values of the parameters \(\kappa_{2}\) and \(\epsilon_{2}\) for each run by using plots like the one shown in Figure 7.

For some runs the cuts based on the value of \(w_{2}\) and the Cherenkov counter were inapplicable. This was due to the obliteration of the difference in \(w_{2}\) for larger pseudorapidities and due to the poor Cherenkov signal. Also the position dependence of the response (described is Section 4) affected these cuts.

Figure 6: The distribution of \(w_{2}\) (run r0330401, \(\eta=-0.65\)). The electron events are on the right of the vertical border line.

The last quantity we used in electron separation cuts is the ratio \(w_{3}\)[1]:

\[w_{3}=\frac{\sqrt{\frac{\frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{i}\left(R_{i}^{\alpha}-\sum \limits_{i}\left(R_{i}^{\alpha}/N\right)\right)^{2}}{\sum\limits_{i}R_{i}^{ \alpha}}} \tag{4}\]

The power parameter \(\alpha=0.6\) has been chosen to achieve maximum separation efficiency [1]; \(N\) is the number of summed PMTs. All the sums in (4) were done over the whole region which was selected for the analysis (i.e. 3 \(\times\) 3 \(\times\) 3 cells in \(\eta\)\(\times\)\(\phi\)\(\times\)\(D\)).

By using the ratio \(w_{3}\) in cuts, we can utilize not only the longitudinal difference between the hadronic and EM shower but also the different lateral properties. As the hadronic shower is larger in both longitudinal and lateral direction, the ratio \(w_{3}\) for pions should be lower than some border value. Figure 8 shows the distribution of \(w_{3}\).

Again, similarly to previous case, we added a cut which combines \(w_{3}\) and the Cherenkov counter signal. We admitted as electron events those events for which the following condition was satisfied:

\[w_{3}\,>\,\kappa_{3}\times(Cher1)+\epsilon_{3} \tag{5}\]

where \(\kappa_{3}<0\). We used plots similar to the one shown in Figure 9 to determine the parameters \(\kappa_{3}\) and \(\epsilon_{3}\) for each run.

Figure 7: Contour plot of the surface density of the events in the \(Cher1\)\(\times\)\(w_{2}\) plane (run r0330401, \(\eta=-0.65\)). The border value of \(w_{2}\) is demarcated by the horizontal line. Also the border line for \(w_{2}\) is plotted (the sloping line). Electron events are the events which are placed above both lines.

In Figure 9 the border value of \(w_{3}\) is demarcated by the horizontal line and the sloping line corresponds to the condition (5).

The ratio \(w_{3}\) is not suitable quantity for distinction between electrons and muons. For rejecting muons we use the previously mentioned cuts.

Also the border line for is plotted (the sloping line). Electron events are the events which are placed above both lines.

### Cuts - summary

We used three types of cuts:

1. Physics events; The spectrum after applying only this cut is in Figure 10 - black line.
2. Beam cuts; The spectrum after adding these cuts is in Figure 10 - blue line.
3. Electron separation cuts; The spectrum after applying all cuts is in Figure 10 - red line.

## 4 The position dependence of the response

For electrons, the module response is significantly dependent on the \(Ximp\) coordinate of the impact position. This dependence appears as a consequence of the sampling fraction variation within one period (basic repeatable geometrical unit of Tilecal modules).

Looking at the front face of the modules, two types of regions alternate in the \(Ximp\) direction. Regions, where the first tile is close to the surface, and regions, where the first tile is much deeper4. This is the reason for the periodically alternating response. For regions, where the active medium is

Figure 10: Comparison of the cuts effects (run r0330401, \(\eta=-0.65\)). See the text for detail explanation.

near the front plate, the EM shower is not very developed when it reaches the active medium. Therefore the response is lower. On the other hand, if there is larger amount of absorber material in front of the active medium, the response is larger. Figure 11 shows the dependence of the response on the \(Ximp\) impact point coordinate.

We fitted to the points in Figure 11 following periodical function:

\[f\left(Ximp\right)=p_{0}\left(1+p_{1}\sin\left(\frac{2\pi\,Ximp}{p_{2}}+p_{3} \right)\right) \tag{6}\]

where \(p_{0}\), \(p_{1}\), \(p_{2}\) and \(p_{3}\) are free parameters. Afterwards we used those parameters for following correction of the response:

\[R^{\prime}=\frac{R}{1+p_{1}\sin\left(\frac{2\pi\,Ximp}{p_{2}}+p_{3}\right)} \tag{7}\]

where \(R\) is the original response and \(R^{\prime}\) is the corrected value.

The position dependence of the response is of course much higher for electrons than for pions. Therefore, the applied corrections have influence on the separation cuts. This influence is strongest for cuts based on the value of \(w_{2}\), for other cuts the influence is less important. On the other hand, the electron separation has influence on the parameters used for the response correction. We repeated following chain of operations until we iteratively reach the stable configuration:

1. Applying electron separation cuts.
2. Fitting (6) on the dependence of the electron response.
3. Applying the correction (7).

The parameter \(p_{2}\) in (6) and (7) (i.e. the period) should be dependent on the impact angle. For impact angle \(\theta_{TB}=0\) we expect \(p_{2}\simeq P\) (\(P=18.3\,\)mm is the designed width of the module period). For impact angles which differ from \(\theta_{TB}=0\) we expect for purely geometrical reasons following behavior of \(p_{2}\):

\[p_{2}=P\,\cos(\theta_{TB}) \tag{8}\]

The dependence of \(p_{2}\) on the impact angle \(\theta_{TB}\) is shown in Figure 12.

For \(\theta_{TB}=|90^{\circ}|\) we obtain \(p_{2}=0\,\)mm from the equation 8 and for these runs (tile scans) there is no position dependence of the response.

## 5 Results for 20 GeV electrons

After applying all cuts and correction (7), we fitted a Gaussian distribution to the spectrum in the range \(\pm 2\sigma\) from the mean value. The fitted Gaussian mean (\(R^{g}\)) and sigma represent the final output of the whole procedure. An example how the final spectrum looks like together with the fitted Gaussian is in Figure 13.

Figure 12: The dependence of \(p_{2}\) on the impact angle \(\theta_{TB}\) for 20 GeV electrons extracted from the \(\eta\) scan. The expected dependence (8) was fitted to the points, with \(P\) as the only free parameter. The value of \(P\) obtained from the fit is close to the desired \(18.3\,\)mm

All the errors in the following sections are statistical errors only. The errors of the mean values of the calibration constant and of the resolution ware calculated as \(RMS/\sqrt{N}\) where \(N\) is the number of points used for calculating the mean.

### 20 GeV electrons, \(\eta\) scan

In Figure 14 are plotted the values of the calibration constant (i.e. \(R^{g}/E_{beam}\)). The plot of the energy resolution (i.e. \(\sigma/R^{g}\)) values is in Figure 15.

One of the PMTs for cell A-4 in the production module is reported as bad. For this cell we used the signal from the good PMT multiplied by two instead of the sum of both PMTs signals. The resulting value of the calibration constant corresponds well to the other results, but the energy resolution deteriorates (see Figure 15).

Figure 13: Detailed view of the final electron spectrum. Gaussian fit in the range \(\pm 2\sigma\). (run r0330401, \(\eta=-0.65\)).

Figure 14: Calibration constant. The plotted points bellow \(\eta=-1\) and above \(\eta=1\) are the values for the Extended Barrel modules. The horizontal line denotes the mean value.

Figure 15: Energy resolution. We excluded the range of small angles (\(\eta=-0.25\) up to \(\eta=+0.25\)) from the calculation of mean value (the horizontal line). For the small angles, the worsening of the energy resolution is related to the large signal corrections on \(Ximp\). We excluded also the value for \(\eta=-0.35\) (bad PMT) from the calculation of the mean value.

For comparison we present also the results for modules JINR-55, IFA-42 and ANL-44 (i.e. for other modules than we had analysed) published in [2]. For these modules the average value of the calibration constant is \((1.047\pm 0.008)\,\)pC/GeV with average \(RMS=0.03\,\)pC/GeV.

The difference of the average calibration constant between our results and the results from [2] is by one order of magnitude smaller than the RMSs and it is roughly the same as the errors.

### 20 GeV electrons, \(\pm 20^{\circ}\) scan

The values of the calibration constant are plotted in Figure 16. The EM calibration constant obtained from \(\pm 20^{\circ}\) scan has been agreed as the calibration of the Tilecal (i.e. for the \(e/\pi\) ratio). We call the ratio \(R^{g}/E_{beam}\) "calibration constant" also for other scans (\(\eta\) or \(\pm 90^{\circ}\) scans). It is natural to do so, as this ratio is the conversion factor between pC and GeV. However, the Tilecal response to electrons depends slightly on the impact angle (this is so called "transition effect" [3]). With respect to this the data used for calibration should be taken under the same conditions (i.e. the same impact angle), in order to enable for instance cell to cell comparisons.

Figure 17 shows the energy resolution. The resolution for cell A-4 is significantly worse than the mean resolution. As mentioned before one of the PMTs which provides the read-out of this cell is reported as bad. For cell A-16 we observed also worse energy resolution, moreover, the value of the calibration constant is lower than the mean. This can be caused by residual pion contamination. This cell is close to the edge of the module and there is no other module on the top, therefore, there are only few cells which can be used in electron separation cuts.

For comparison we present also the results for modules JINR-55, IFA-42 and ANL-44 (i.e. for other modules than we had analysed) published in [2]. For these modules the average value of the calibration constant is \((1.060\pm 0.005)\,\)pC/GeV with average \(RMS=0.023\,\)pC/GeV.

The difference of the average calibration constant between our results and the results from [2] is by one order of magnitude smaller than the RMSs, the results equal within their errors.

Figure 16: Calibration constant. The mean value is shown (the horizontal line). We excluded from the calculation of the mean the cells A-4 and A-16. The uniformity of the calibration constant (i.e. RMS in %) is 1.5%.

Figure 17: Energy resolution. We excluded from the calculation of the mean the cells A-4 and A-16.

### 20 GeV electrons, \(\pm 90^{\circ}\) (tile) scan

For most of the tile scans the energy resolution for the first and last tile (tile-row) is worse than the mean value. This can be caused by the closeness of the module edge and thus worse electron pion separation.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:21]

For the data used in this study the response of these modules at \(\pm 90^{\circ}\) is higher than at \(\pm 20^{\circ}\). The average difference is 1.7 %. This difference occurs due to the "transition effect" [3], which is result of the inner structure of the modules.

For comparison, we present the values of the calibration constants published in [2] for other modules than we had analysed:

* Barrel module JINR 55 at \(-90^{\circ}\): \(R^{g}/E_{beam}=1.086\pm 0.012\); \(RMS=3.5\%\)
* Barrel module JINR 55 at \(+90^{\circ}\): \(R^{g}/E_{beam}=1.078\pm 0.016\); \(RMS=5\%\)
* Extended Barrel module IFA 42 at \(-90^{\circ}\): \(R^{g}/E_{beam}=1.101\pm 0.016\); \(RMS=5.2\%\)
* Extended Barrel module ANL 44 at \(+90^{\circ}\): \(R^{g}/E_{beam}=1.052\pm 0.012\); \(RMS=3.8\%\)

For the Barrel modules the difference of the average calibration constant between our results for \(-90^{\circ}\) and for \(+90^{\circ}\) is approximately two times higher than the errors. The average values of the calibration constant for the Barrel modules from [2] are within the interval defined by the our values.

The difference of the calibration constants, we obtained for the two Extended Barrel modules, is very small (smaller than the errors). Both our values lie inside the interval defined by the values from [2].

## 6 Results for 180 GeV electrons

For the analyses of the 180 GeV electron runs we used cuts similar to the cuts used for the 20 GeV electrons, but in this case we didn't use the Cherenkov counter, which cannot provide the electron/pion separation at such high energy. The procedure of applying position dependence correction was exactly the same as for 20 GeV runs.

Figure 26 shows the values of the calibration constant (i.e. \(R^{g}/E_{beam}\)) and the resolutions are shown in Figure 27.

For cell A-2 (i.e. \(\eta=-0.15\)), there is a difference of about 20% in the signal of the PMTs. In the calculations we used sum of the PMTs signal as usually. The result of the run for which the cell A-2 is the impact cell is marked in the plots.

The lower value of the calibration constant at \(\eta=-0.85\) can be a consequence of the following: Firstly, the measurement is performed near the edge of the module and therefore there is only small number of "neighbor" cells usable for electron separation cuts. This can worsen the electron separation. Secondly, in one of those "neighbor" cells one of the PMT is reportedas bad. Double value of the good PMT signal is used instead of the sum of the PMTs.

For comparison we present the results published in other papers for other modules then we had analysed:

* Barrel module JINR 55 [2]: The calibration constant Barrel module \(R_{fit}^{g}/E_{beam}=1.062\pm 0.013\);
* Barrel module JINR 12 [4]: The calibration constant Barrel module \(R_{fit}^{g}/E_{beam}=1.014\pm 0.011\);

The value of the calibration constant obtained by us for JINR 63 is between the two values stated above.

Figure 26: Calibration constant. The horizontal line is the mean value. See the text for detail explanation.

## 7 Results Summary

The summary of the uniformity of the response is in Table 2. The larger spread of the values of the calibration constant for \(\pm 90^{\circ}\) runs than for \(\pm 20^{\circ}\) runs is consequence of the Cesium calibration method. Since the high voltage level is set for given PMT, it has to be set according the average Cesium response of the tiles in the cell. It cannot be set for individual tilerows.

Figure 27: Energy resolution. We excluded the range of small angles (\(\eta=-0.25\) up to \(\eta=+0.25\)) from the calculation of mean value (the horizontal lines).

Then if the shower crosses higher number of tilerows (the case of \(\pm 20^{\circ}\) runs) the uniformity is better. If the shower is contained only inside one tilerow (the case of \(\pm 90^{\circ}\) runs) then the uniformity is worse.

Remarkable result is the relatively small difference (0.6 %) of the calibration constants for 20 GeV and 180 GeV \(\eta\) scans. This reveals the proper behavior of the bi-gain readout system, as for 20 GeV electrons the response of all channels is in HIGH Gain mode and for 180 GeV the largest contribution to the response comes from channels in LOW Gain mode.
