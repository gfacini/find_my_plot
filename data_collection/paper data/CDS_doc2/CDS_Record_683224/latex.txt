## 1 Introduction

Muon spectrometers in experiments at future supercolliders will be systems of large dimensions. The final muon momentum resolution will strongly depend on the precise alignment of the muon chambers. In systems like the superconducting toroid of the ASCOT protocol-laboration [1], the correct measurement of the sagitta of the muon track would require a full systematic error less than 50 \(\mu m\).

The alignment can be controlled with mechanical or opto-mechanical thecliques [2]; in the L3 experiment it has been achived an accuracy of \(\sim\,30\mu m\)[3].

Another complementary method that could be used to monitor the alignement is the offline analysis of the \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) events, largely produced at the LHC [4]. In this note we consider an air core toroid spectrometer and a three-points detection for the muon track sagitta measurement. This implies three chambers layers, located at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the magnet (see fig. 1). So far, we have considered only the muon chambers positionned at \(\eta=0\).

## 2 The method.

Any deviation of the chamber alignment brings to a systematic error to the sagitta measurement. Out of the many aspects to be controlled for a complete alignment, the more important one is the "vertical alignment", i.e. the relative position of the middle chamber (MM) with the respect to the inner and outer chambers (MI and MO), along the beam direction. This is the only type of alignment surveyed during the data taking in the L3 experiment. The method presented here is intended to check this vertical alignment; all other sources of possible systematic effects are neglected.

Consequently, for a given muon chamber module there is one single parameter to be measured: the misalignment \(x\) of the MM chamber with the respect to the MI and MO chambers for which the measured sagitta \(s\) have to be corrected: \(s\to s+x\).

The idea is to study a given pair of muon modules. They are choosen back to back in the transverse plane; namely most of the leptons from \(Z\) decay are produced in opposite directions in this plane. For that module pair we can measure for each event the sum \(\Sigma=s_{1}+s_{2}\), where the \(s_{i}\) (\(i=1,2\)) are the two sagittas. For a perfect alignment, because the \(\phi\) simmetry we expect that \(\Sigma\) is distributed with vanishing mean value. The smearingaround zero is due to the fact that Z are produced with a not vanishing transverse momentum. If a misalignment \(-x_{i}\) (\(i=1,2\)) takes place then it turns out that

\[<\Sigma>=-(x_{1}+x_{2}) \tag{1}\]

In order to identify the individual correction constants \(x_{i}\) the \(Z\) mass constraint can be used.

If we write the inverse of the squared invariant mass of the two muon system as a function of the sagittas we find

\[-m^{-2}=Ks_{1}s_{2} \tag{2}\]

The K-factor includes the space opening angle between the two muons and the bending power of the magnet seen individually by each muon; it is measured event by event. By correcting the two sagittas for \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) we have

\[-m^{-2}=K(s_{1}+x_{1})\times(s_{2}+x_{2})\] \[-m^{-2}=K(s_{1}s_{2}\ +\ s_{1}x_{2}+s_{2}x_{1}\ +\ x_{1}x_{2}) \tag{3}\]

for small value of \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) the quantity \(x_{1}x_{2}\) is a second order term and can be ignored. So,

\[-m^{-2}-Ks_{1}s_{2}=s_{1}x_{2}+s_{2}x_{1} \tag{4}\]

by forcing the mass to be equal to the nominal value of the \(Z\) mass and introducing (1) in (4), we obtain the individual alignment corrections:

\[x_{1}=\frac{Km_{Z}^{-2}\ +\ s_{2}(s_{1}-\Sigma)}{s_{2}-s_{1}} \tag{5}\] \[x_{2}=\frac{Km_{Z}^{-2}\ +\ s_{1}(s_{2}-\Sigma)}{s_{1}-s_{2}} \tag{6}\]

## 3 Results.

We have simulated \(pp\to Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) events using the ISAJET Monte Carlo [5]. The muons have been traced in a omogeneus magnetic field of 0.6 T. The magnetic region is 5m thick; so the bending power is 3 Tm for normally incident muons. As already stated, the detector planes are located at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of this region. The hit position have been smeared with a gaussian distribution with \(\sigma=50\ \mu m\) and the ultimate sagitta value is smeared with a gaussian distribution of \(\sigma(s)/s=0.05\), in order to simulate the effects from the muon multiple scattering in the spectrometer and the energy losses in the central calorimeter of a LHC detector. Finally, the opening angle in space between the two muons has been smeared with a gaussian distribution with \(\sigma=50\) mrad.

Fig. 2 shows the \(p_{T}\) distribution of the generated \(Z\)s; an average \(p_{T}=12\ GeV/c\) is predicted. Fig. 3 shows the sagittas as they are measured in this spectrometer; the approximative value of \(1\ cm\) is expected by a muon of about 50 GeV momentum. The measured \(Z\) invariant mass is shown in fig. 4; the r.m.s. of the distribution of about \(4\ GeV/c^{2}\) is consistent with a resolution \(\sigma(p)/p=0.05\). Fig. 5a shows the distribution of \(\Sigma\) of 2000decays after having applied all the smearing effects already mentioned. The width of the distribution is largely due to the fluctuation of the \(Z\) transverse momentum. The statistical error of the mean value has been determined fitting in fig. 5b the observed distribution with a gaussian curve from \(-5\) mm to \(5\) mm. The result is \(\sigma(\Sigma)=50~{}\mu m\). This result depends weakly on the choice of the fit interval. In fig. 6 and 7 the distribution for \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) are shown. The statistical error, on them once \(<\Sigma>\) is perfectly known, is around \(13~{}\mu m\): this means that the final accuracy on this alignment monitor is dominated by the degree of accuracy of the quantity \(\Sigma\) ( the degree of accuracy on the alignment of the Z-mass constraint alone is particularly good). By combining properly the errors here discussed we find that the individual corrections \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) are determined with an accuracy of \(40~{}\mu m\) at \(1\sigma\) for \(2000~{}Z\) decays.

As an example, we...we moved the two middle chambers in the simulator of \(200\) and \(300\)\(\mu m\) respectevely. In fig. 8 we show the distribution of \(\Sigma\); the deviation of the peak from \(0\) is clearly visible. Finally in fig. 9 and 10 we show the distribution for \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\). The correction constant for the alignment have been correctly found within the statistical errors.

## 4 Z rates.

The rate of events \(Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) with both \(p_{T}\geq~{}20~{}GeV/c\) (this could be a possible threshold for a dimuon trigger) predicted by the Monte Carlo is \(20\) Hz at the nominal luminosity \(L=10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\); assuming to have muon system granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.4\times 2\pi/12\) it results that the acceptance of the Z detection in a given sector pair is \(7\times 10^{-4}\). So the final rate would be \(1.4\times 10^{-2}\). This implies that the time needed to collect \(2000\) Z is about \(40\) hours. In a week of data taking it is possible to achieve an alignment of \(40\mu m\) with \(2\sigma\) accuracy.

It is worthwhile to remark that possible misalignments due to thermal drifts with short periods will be not, of course, accessible to this procedure.

## 5 Conclusion.

In this note we have presented a possible offline procedure to monitor the alignment of a large muon spectrometer based on a air core magnet system, in an experiment at the LHC. This method consists on the analysis of the \(Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) events largely produced in this machine. The performances of this alignment monitor have been studied at \(\eta=0\) for a sample of Z. It turns out that with \(8000\) Z an accuracy of \(40~{}\mu m\) at \(2\sigma\) can be achieved. This amount of events would be collected in one week of data taking.

It remains to extend this study in the full barrel region (\(\mid\eta\mid<1.2\)). Also effects from a possible contamination of background events have to be considered; however a dimuon event selection based on invariant mass and isolation cuts should lead to a very good Z sample.
