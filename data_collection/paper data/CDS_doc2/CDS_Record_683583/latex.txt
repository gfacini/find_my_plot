ABSTRACT

We report submodule envelope measurements made on the submodules used for the assembly of AE0. The standard height measurements,show an interesting systematic effect which is not understood, but does not have a significant affect on the mechanical assembly of the prototype. A set of precision measurements of the submodule envelope was made by the inspection group here at Argonne on one of the 5 submodules fabricated for the extended barrel prototype module. The submodule envelope fitted well within the envelope defined by the design, calculated by us to be +/- 0.275mm for the net effect of tolerances in the master plate keypay and envelope and the stacking fixture key. The maximum deviation from nominal was found to be 0.214mm

**1. Introduction**

This report documents the measurements made on submodules used for the assembly of AB0. In Section 2, we present a compilation of the standard height measurements made with submodules lying flat on a marble table. In Section 2, we present the result of a series of high precision inspection measurements made of the azimuthal envelope of a single (arbitrary) submodule. Since the stacking fixture outer radius key used on our fixture has been used for the assembly of the largest number of submodules to date, we document measurements made on the key width to look for wear or other problems in Section 3. Some conclusions are presented in Section 4.

**2. Submodule Standard Height Measurements**

The standard set of submodule height measurements were made at the locations indicated in figure 1. The data for the 8 standard submodules and the one special submodule are shown in Table 1. ANL5-8 refer to the 4 standard submodules stacked at Argonne in October and November 1996 (1-4 representing the first four constructed for the barrel prototype). The one special submodule (SPEC)was also constructed at Argonne in this period. The Argonne stacking fixture was then shipped to the University of Illinois and 4 additional standard submodules constructed there. These are identified as UI1-4.

The standard height variation as a function of position relative to the inner and outer radius which we associate with weld deformation is seen in all submodules at about the same relative level. One aspect of considerable interest seen in this data is that, despite being constructed using the identical stacking fixture, the average height relative to nominal is -0.047mm for the ANL submodules, whereas it is -0.450mm for the UI submodules. Although part of this comes from the UI modules apparently having more weld deformation there appears to be a global difference. The source of such a difference is difficult to envisage.

## 3 Submodule Phi Envelope Measurements

The submodule azimuthal tolerance envelope is a critical aspect of the tile calorimeter design. Measurements made at CERN, have indicated that there might be significant excursions outside this envelope within a submodule. We have therefore carried out an independent inspection of the submodule envelope using the first submodule from the production of submodules for the extended barrel prototype assembly.

The first issue which must be addressed is the definition and specification of

the design envelope. Following the approach discussed in reference 1, the submodule (and module) envelope analysis is shown in figure 2. Of relevence to this note is the stacking offset (1), of 0.275mm. This number may be interpreted in the following way. If the centerline of the submodule is chosen to be the point midway between the edges of the keyway, then relative to this line, all points on the envelope of the submodule must lie within 0.275mm of their nominal dimension. Note that although other design issues are relevent in the discussion of figure 2, they will not be addressed further here.

The measurements were made by the Inspection Group in Central Shops at Argonne National Laboratory. All inspection equipment used by this group is required to be kept in constant calibration against US Bureau of Standards requirements.

Our objective is to determine the submodule envelope and therefore we have chosen to determine the extreme points of the module envelope on the phi surface. The measurement technique is shown schematically in figure 3. The measurements were made on a three axis coordinate measuring machine manufactured by....... This machine was calibrated most recently on Jan. 1997. The interpreted accuracy of the machine probe in any direction is approximately 0.005mm. Two additional items were used for the measurement. These items were two precision machin

ist squares and a precision straight edge. These squares and the straight edge were checked for perpendicularity and straightness before using them to make these measurements. The repeatability of these measurements is estimated to be 0.025mm.

The submodule was oriented on the bed of the machine in the same orientation in which it was constructed. the maximum length of the y-axis travel (radially along the length of the submodule) was 1 meter. For this reason, one shift was made during the measurement. This was accomplished by measuring one of the source holes that was not occupied by a spring pin and zeroing the probe on the axis of that hole (determined to high precision by tracing the hole.) The centerline of this hole was then centered on the small radius key and the y-axis re-established. This same hole and the large radius key were used to establish the centerline before the shift. The mechanical centerline used to carry out the measurements was established by using calipers to determine the center of the inner and outer radius keys and setting the precision straight edge on these two locations. The final data were corrected to account for a slight mis-alignment of this straight edge, using the measurements of the key edges themselves on the machine. This correction was of order 0.050mm. All envelope measurements were made by setting the large square on the machine bed and touching the high spot on the submodule. Before taking the measurement, a small square was used to assure that the large square was perpendicular to the masterplate edges (as indicated in figure 3.) The repeatability of these measurements was estimated by the inspection group to be 0.025mm.

The nominal dimension and deviation from the nominal at each location is

Table 3: Period location of extremumspecification.) The stacking fixture used for these modules has seen the most use of any fabricated to date for use in TileCal. The width of this key has been measured at CERN in Nov. 1995 and at Argonne in Feb 1997, following its use for the production of 15 submodules. The measurements made on the outer radius key are shown in Table 4. The points are taken approximately every inch along the height of the key (point 1 being at the base of the key and 13 at the top). The measurements made at CERN were taken using a CERN micrometer, which had been zeroed against a calibration block. This recalibration amounted to an offset of 0.015mm from the initial reading of the instrument and may be used to represent the intrinsic precision of these data. The measurements made at Argonne were taken using a Mitutoyo 12 inch vernier caliper allowing a repeatability of 0.01mm.

The data are consistent with a stacking key width of 180.81 to 180.83mm and with no measureable wear resulting from the stacking of the 15 submodules for which is was used. They support the hypothesis that the minimum width of the keyway on a submodule is determined entirely by the width of the stacking key (as expected for a random distribution of plates during stacking.)

## 3 Conclusions

We have carried out a detailed inspection of the envelope of a single submodule from the production for AE0. The envelope is fully within the design specification. The width of the keyway is marginally below the design tolerance zone. This, however, is not anticipated to cause a problem for module assembly since the deviation is not much larger than the diameter of a human hair. We antici
