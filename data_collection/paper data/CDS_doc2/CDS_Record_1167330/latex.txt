This section summarizes the general aspects of jet reconstruction with the ATLAS detector. General but brief descriptions of the available jet algorithms are provided, together with a discussion of the performance expectations for the various algorithm configurations in different detector regions and for different physics environments. The emphasis is on realistic estimates for the initial jet reconstruction performance, determined in the absence of experimental data. The corresponding expectations for important jet reconstruction parameters like signal linearity and uniformity, the relative energy resolution, and the jet reconstruction efficiency and purity, are presented.

## 1 Introduction

High quality and highly efficient jet reconstruction is an important tool for almost all physics analyses to be performed with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The requirements especially for the absolute precision on the jet energy scale often exceed the corresponding achieved performance in previous experiments. Typically, an absolute systematic uncertainty of better than 1% is desirable for precision physics like the measurement of the top quark mass, and the reconstruction of some SUSY final states.

The principal detector for jet reconstruction is the ATLAS calorimeter system, with its basic components depicted in Fig. 1. It provides near hermetic coverage in a pseudorapidity range \(-4.9<\eta<4.9\). The technology choices are well suited for high quality jet reconstruction in the challenging environment of the proton-proton (\(pp\)) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV at the LHC. The electromagnetic liquid argon/lead calorimeters feature an accordion geometry homogeneous in azimuthal coverage for \(|\eta|<3.2\). The hadronic calorimeters surrounding them are iron with scintillating tile readout in the central region (\(|\eta|\lower 2.15pt\hbox{$\;\buildrel<\over{\sim}\;$}1.7\)) and parallel plate liquid argon/copper in the endcap region (\(1.7\lower 2.15pt\hbox{$\;\buildrel<\over{\sim}\;$}|\eta|\lower 2.15pt\hbox{$\; \buildrel<\over{\sim}\;$}3.2\)). The forward region is covered by liquid argon/copper and liquid argon/tungsten calorimetry with a tubular electrode readout accommodating the high ionization rates expected at LHC at design luminosity. The readout of the calorimeters is highly granular for the electromagnetic devices, with typically three longitudinal segments with varying lateral cell sizes, e.g. \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.025\times 0.025\) in the second segment containing the electromagnetic shower maximum. The hadronic calorimeters are coarser, with typically \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\), but have also at least three longitudinal segments. The total number of readout cells in the ATLAS calorimeter system is close to \(200,000\). The total thickness of the ATLAS calorimeter system for hadrons is at least 10 absorption lengths over the whole acceptance region. More details on the calorimeters, and any other detectors in ATLAS, can be found in Ref. [1].

In this note the approaches used by the ATLAS collaboration to achieve the challenging perfor

mance goals are discussed. First, the most commonly used jet finders are briefly introduced in Section 2, together with the theoretical and experimental guidelines for the ATLAS implementations. Then, the expectations for the performance of these algorithms using different detector signals are shown in Section 3. As the focus is on the upcoming initial data taking period of ATLAS, some distortions in the detector alignment and material distributions have been included but not corrected in the results presented here. Finally, special challenges to jet reconstruction like forward going jets and jets in minimum bias events are discussed in Section 4, followed by conclusions in Section 5.

## 2 Jet algorithms in ATLAS

In general an attempt is made to provide implementations of all relevant jet finding algorithms in ATLAS. These include fixed sized cone algorithms as well as sequential recombination algorithms and an algorithm based on event shape analysis. This approach is a response to the fact that there is no universal jet finder for the hadronic final state in all topologies of interest. For example, for the measurement of the inclusive QCD jet cross-sections wider jets are typically preferred to capture the hard scattered parton kinematics, including possible small angle gluon radiation, completely. On the other hand, to reconstruct a \(W\) boson decaying into two jets or to find jets in very busy final states like \(t\overline{t}\) production or possible SUSY signatures, narrow jets are preferred.

The common feature of all jet finder implementations in ATLAS is full four-momentum recombination whenever the constituents of a jet change, either through adding a new constituent, or by removing one, or by changing the kinematic contribution of a given constituent to the jet. Also, in the ATLAS reconstruction software framework Athena, the same jet finder code can be run on objects like calorimeter signal towers, topological cell clusters in the calorimeters, reconstructed tracks, and generated particles and partons.

In this section the basics of the present default jet algorithms used in ATLAS are discussed after a brief summary of the theoretical and experimental guidelines for jet algorithm implementation. In addition, some features of jet finders not included in the more comprehensive presentation of jet reconstruction performance in Section 3 are shown.

### Guidelines for jet reconstruction

The basic guidelines for jet reconstruction in ATLAS have been extracted from Ref. [2]. They also reflect the concept of _jet definition_ discussed in Ref. [3], which is an attempt to provide a common understanding between experiments and theory on how a given jet finding strategy should be specified to assure the highest level of comparability between the results from various sources.

#### 2.1.1 Theoretical guidelines

The major theoretical guidelines for jet reconstruction are:

**Infrared safety:**: The presence of additional soft particles between two particles belonging to the same jet should not affect the recombination of these two particles into a jet. In the same sense, the absence of additional particles between these two should not disturb the correct reconstruction of the jet. Generally, any soft particles not coming from the fragmentation of a hard scattered parton should not effect the number of jets produced.
**Collinear safety:**: A jet should be reconstructed independent of the fact that a certain amount of transverse momentum is carried by one particle, or if a particle is split into two collinear particles.

**Order independence:**: The same hard scattering should be reconstructed independently at parton-, particle- or detector level.

Note that from the perspective of experimental data the particles mentioned in these guidelines can, to a point, be replaced by four-momentum type objects reconstructed from detector signals, see e.g. Section 2.5 and Section 2.6 below.

#### 2.1.2 Experimental guidelines

Additional aspects of jet reconstruction in ATLAS include features also reflected in the design of the detector. They can be divided into three classes.

**Detector technology independence:**: The reconstructed jet and its kinematic variables should not dependent on the signal source, i.e. all detector specific signal characteristics and inefficiencies must be calibrated out or corrected as much as possible.
**Detector resolution:**: contributions from the finite spatial and energy resolution must be at a minimum;
**Detector environment:**: effects from the detector environment like electronics noise, signal losses in un-instrumented (inactive) materials and cracks between detectors must be at a minimum;
**Stable signals:**: the detector signal reconstruction and calibration must provide a stable input signal to jet reconstruction.
**Environment independence:**: The jet reconstruction environment is characterized by the additional activity in the collision event due to multiple interactions and pile-up, the source of the jet, the underlying event activity, and other features of the \(pp\) collisions at LHC.
**Stability:**: a jet should be found and reconstructed safely even in the case of changing underlying event activity and changing instantaneous luminosity, thus changing number of multiple interactions;
**Efficiency:**: all physically interesting jets from energetic partons must be identified with high efficiency.
**Implementation:**: The jet algorithm implementation must be fully specified in that the jet definition, which consists of the jet finder and its configuration together with the choice of kinematic recombination given in Ref. [3], must be complete. Also included must be all selections and, if important for the measured jet, the signal choices. In addition, the implementation of the jet reconstruction must make efficient use of computing resources, i.e. it must be sufficiently fast and avoid excessive memory consumption.

The most commonly used jet finder implementations in ATLAS are a seeded fixed cone finder with split and merge (see below), and a \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) algorithm [4, 5] implementation, with an initial implementation as described in Ref. [6], but later replaced by a faster implementation similar to the one in the FastJet package [7]. It is anticipated that for the first experimental collision data all implementations of the FastJet library (\(k_{\mathrm{T}}\), anti-\(k_{\mathrm{T}}\), Cambridge flavor \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\)[8]) will be available, as well as the seedless infrared-safe cone algorithm SISCone[9]. As there are no complete systematic evaluations of these algorithms available for this note, they are excluded from further discussions here.

### Fixed cone jet finder in ATLAS

The ATLAS implementation of the iterative seeded fixed-cone jet finder follows the algorithm description of Ref. [2]. First, all input is ordered in decreasing order in transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). If the object with the highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is above the seed threshold, all objects within a cone in pseudorapidity \(\eta\) and azimuth \(\phi\) with \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}<R_{\mathrm{cone}}\), where \(R_{\mathrm{cone}}\) is the fixed cone radius, are combined with the seed. A new direction is calculated from the four-momenta inside the initial cone and a new cone is centered around it. Objects are then (re-)collected in this new cone, and again the direction is updated. This process continues until the direction of the cone does not change anymore after recombination, at which point the cone is considered stable and is called a jet. At this point the next seed is taken from the input list and a new cone jet is formed with the same iterative procedure. This continues until no more seeds are available. The jets found this way can share constituents, and signal objects contributing to the cone at some iteration maybe lost again due to the recalculation of the direction at a later iteration.

This algorithm is not infrared safe, which can be (at least) partly recovered by introducing a split and merge step after the jet formation is done. Jets which share constituents with more than a certain fraction \(f_{\mathrm{sm}}\) of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the less energetic jet are merged, while they are split if the amount of shared \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is below \(f_{\mathrm{sm}}\), with \(f_{\mathrm{sm}}=0.5\) in ATLAS. Other important parameters of the ATLAS cone jet finder are a seed threshold of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>1\) GeV, and a narrow (\(R_{\mathrm{cone}}=0.4\)) and a wide cone jet (\(R_{\mathrm{cone}}=0.7\)) option.

From a theoretical standpoint this particular cone jet finder is by design only meaningful to leading order for inclusive jet cross-section measurements and final states like \(W/Z+1\) jet, but is not meaningful at any order for 3-jet final states, \(W/Z+2\) jets, and for the measurement of the dijet invariant mass in 2 jets \(+X\) final states [10].

### Sequential recombination algorithms

The default implementation of a sequential recombination jet finder in ATLAS is the \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) algorithm. Here all pairs ij of input objects (partons, particles, reconstructed detector objects with four-momentum representation) are analyzed with respect to their relative transverse momentum squared, defined by

\[d_{ij}=\min(p_{\mathrm{T},i}^{2},\,p_{\mathrm{T},\,j}^{2})\frac{\Delta R_{ \bar{q}}^{2}}{R^{2}}=\min(p_{\mathrm{T},i}^{2},p_{\mathrm{T},\,j}^{2})\frac{ \Delta\eta_{\bar{q}}^{2}+\Delta\phi_{\bar{q}}^{2}}{R^{2}}\,,\]

and the squared \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of object \(i\) relative to the beam \(d_{i}=p_{\mathrm{T},i}^{2}\). The minimum \(d_{\mathrm{min}}\) of all \(d_{\bar{q}}\) and \(d_{i}\) is found. If \(d_{\mathrm{min}}\) is a \(d_{\bar{q}}\), the corresponding objects \(i\) and \(j\) are combined into a new object \(k\) using four-momentum recombination. Both objects \(i\) and \(j\) are removed from the list, and the new object \(k\) is added to it.

If \(d_{\mathrm{min}}\) is a \(d_{i}\), the object \(i\) is considered to be a jet by itself and removed from the list. This procedure is repeated for the resulting new sets of \(d_{\bar{q}}\) and \(d_{i}\) until all objects are removed from the list. This means that all original input objects end up to be either part of a jet or to be jets by themselves. Contrary to the cone algorithm described earlier, no objects are shared between jets. The procedure is infrared safe. As it does not use seeds, it is also collinear safe. The distance parameter \(R\), which is the only free parameter besides the choice of recombination scheme in this inclusive implementation of the \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) algorithm, allows some control on the size of the jets. Default configurations in ATLAS are \(R=0.4\) for narrow and \(R=0.6\) for wide jets.

Table 1 summarizes the algorithms and configurations which have been used by ATLAS for basically all pre-collision physics studies. Thus, these are the base for most predictions related to the performance of the hadronic final state reconstruction for all studied physics channels available to date.

### Alternative jet finders

As jet finders others than the "default" algorithms and configurations discussed above can be more appropriate for the precision analysis of specific final states, additional jet algorithms are available in ATLASfor application at the analysis stage. Those are the mid-point variant of the fixed cone algorithm originally introduced by CDF in Ref. [2, 11], and the "optimal jet finder" discussed in Ref. [12]. Both algorithms have been studied for ATLAS and in general provide a very similar performance when compared to the default seeded cone and \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) implementations. This can be seen in Fig. 2 for the mid-point algorithm, which, as already said, is a flavour of the fixed cone algorithm with the modification that the seeds are placed between two particles with significant \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), rather than just using an individual particle \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) as seed directly. Besides a slightly smaller efficiency in the central region, there are no significant differences between the studied jet finders observed in this non-comprehensive investigation with simulated \(t\overline{t}b\overline{b}\) events.

The optimal jet finder is a departure from the traditional approach of reconstructing each jet rather independent from previously reconstructed jets in the same event. Here the basic scheme is to calculate a weight for each particle reflecting the contribution to any jet by minimizing a test function event by event. This function actually includes weights for contributions to transverse momentum not clustered into any jet at all, thus using the overall event shape when reconstructing the jets. Parameters of the algorithm are a jet cone size and a threshold for the test function. A more exclusive mode is available where the number of jets to be reconstructed can be fixed beforehand. In general this jet finder works well in busy final states like full hadronic top-quark decays in \(t\overline{t}\) production. Predictions for the relative top mass resolution, for example, are basically identical for the default \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) implementation with \(R=0.6\) and the optimal jet finder for the same jet size.

### Calorimeter jets

The most important detectors for jet reconstruction are the ATLAS calorimeters. In this section the input signals and default calibration schemes for calorimeter jets are briefly described.

The ATLAS calorimeter system [13] has about \(200,000\) individual cells of various sizes and with different readout technologies and electrode geometries. For jet finding it is necessary to first combine these cell signals into larger signal objects with physically meaningful four-momenta. The two concepts available are calorimeter _signal towers_ and _topological cell clusters_.

#### 2.5.1 Calorimeter tower signals

In case of the towers, the cells are projected onto a fixed grid in pseudorapidity (\(\eta\)) and azimuth (\(\phi\)). The tower bin size is \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\) in the whole acceptance region of the calorimeters, i.e. in \(|\eta|<5\) and \(-\pi<\phi<\pi\) with \(100\times 64=6,400\) towers in total. Projective calorimeter cells which completely fit inside a tower contribute their total signal, as reconstructed on a basic electromagnetic energy scale2), to the tower signal. Non-projective cells and projective cells larger than the tower bin size contribute

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c l} \hline \hline Algorithm & Main parameter & Clients \\ \hline Seeded fixed cone & \(R_{\mathrm{cone}}=0.4\) & \(W\to jj\) in \(t\overline{t}\), SUSY \\ \cline{2-3} (seed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>1\) GeV) & \(R_{\mathrm{cone}}=0.7\) & inclusive jet cross-section, \(Z^{\prime}\to jj\) \\ \hline \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) & \(R=0.4\) & \(W\to jj\) in \(t\overline{t}\), SUSY \\ \cline{2-3}  & \(R=0.6\) & inclusive jet cross-section, \(Z^{\prime}\to jj\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

a fraction of their signal to several towers, depending on the overlap fraction of the cell area with the towers, see Fig. 3 for illustration.

Thus, the tower signal is the nondiscriminatory sum of possibly weighted cell signals (all cells are included). As the cell signals are on the basic electromagnetic energy scale, the resulting tower signal is on the same scale. No further corrections or calibrations are applied at this stage.

#### 2.5.2 Topological cell clusters

The alternative representation of the calorimeter signals for jet reconstruction are topological cell clusters, which are basically an attempt to reconstruct three-dimensional "energy blobs" representing the showers developing for each particle entering the calorimeter. The clustering starts with seed cells with a signal-to-noise ratio, or signal significance \(\Gamma=E_{\rm cell}\big{/}\sigma_{\rm noise,\,cell}\), above a certain threshold \(S\), i.e. \(|\Gamma|>S=4\). All directly neighbouring cells of these seed cells, in all three dimensions, are collected into the cluster. Neighbours of neighbours are considered for those added cells which have \(\Gamma\) above a certain secondary threshold \(N\) (\(|\Gamma|>N=2\)). Finally, a ring of guard cells with signal significances above a basic threshold \(|\Gamma|>P=0\) is added to the cluster. After the initial clusters are formed, they are analyzed for local signal maximums by a splitting algorithm, and split between those maximums if any are found [15].

Figure 4 shows the average number of particles in Monte Carlo generated jets from QCD dijet production together with the number of topological cell clusters in the corresponding simulated calorimeter jets. The figure indicates that the clustering algorithm resolves the particle content of the jet in the pseudorapidity range \(1.5\lower 3.01pt\hbox{$\;\buildrel<\over{\sim}\;$}|\eta|\lower 3.01pt\hbox{$\; \buildrel<\over{\sim}\;$}2.5\). The shower overlap between the particles in the jet cannot be resolved as well in the central region \(|\eta|\lower 3.01pt\hbox{$\;\buildrel<\over{\sim}\;$}1.5\), where the calorimeter cell sizes are a bit larger on the scale of the hadronic shower. Here the ratio of number of particles per cluster is approximately 1.6. Similarly, in the forward region \(|\eta|\lower 3.01pt\hbox{$\;\buildrel>\over{\sim}\;$}2.5\) both the increase in shower overlap, due to the decreasing linear distance between jet particles, and the increase of the cell sizes reduce the resolution power of the clustering algorithm for individual particle showers.

Figure 3: Calorimeter cell signal contributions to towers on a regular \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\) grid, for projective and non-projective cells. The signal contribution is expressed as a geometrical weight and is calculated as the ratio of the tower bin area over the projective cell area in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\).

Like towers, clusters are initially formed using the basic electromagnetic energy scale cell signals. These clusters can already be used for jet reconstruction. In addition, clusters can be calibrated to a local hadronic energy scale. This calibration starts with a classification step characterizing clusters as electromagnetic, hadronic, or noise, based on their location and shape. After that, cell signals inside hadronic clusters are weighted with functions depending on cluster location, energy, and the cell signal density. Then, a correction for energy losses in inactive materials close to or inside the cluster is applied. Finally, a correction for signal losses due to the clustering itself (out-of-cluster correction) is applied. Note that all calibrations and corrections for topological clusters are derived from single particle simulations and do not use the jet context.

#### 2.5.3 Characteristics of calorimeter input to jet finding

There are attempts in ATLAS to go beyond the high quality reconstruction of the total jet signal with the best possible resolution. Especially the reconstruction of jet structure, including the lateral and longitudinal signal distributions, can be useful to apply jet energy scale corrections jet by jet, or reconstruct the origin of a given jet. The ability to reconstruct this structure depends on the choice of the calorimeter signal definition used in jet finding, as is qualitatively indicated in the simulated high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) QCD event in Fig. 5. A given calorimeter signal definition like clusters may reproduce the jet shape at particle level better in certain regions of the calorimeters than in others. For example, from the depicted event in this figure the cluster signals represent the transverse energy flow of particles inside a jet better than the tower jets in the central and endcap regions, while in the forward region the clusters cannot resolve individual showers anymore and thus cannot reproduce the jet shape very well. Here the towers still reflect some spatial structure of the incoming particles.

Another important difference between tower and cluster jets is the number of calorimeter cells used in the jet. While towers include all cells of the ATLAS calorimeters, topological clustering actually applies noise suppression due to the cell signal significance cuts used. This means that many fewer cells contribute to jets in case of clusters, and that the noise contribution per jet is also smaller for cluster jets than for tower jets, see Section 3.3.1 for further discussion.

Jet finding needs physical four-momenta on input. Thus, both towers and clusters are defined as massless pseudo-particles with a four-momentum \((E,\vec{p})\), reconstructed from the reconstructed energy

Figure 4: Estimates for the average number of particles in seeded fixed size cone jets with \(R_{\mathrm{cone}}=0.7\) in fully simulated QCD dijet production, shown as function of the pseudorapidity \(\eta\) of the jet. Also shown is the corresponding average number of topological clusters in matching jets found with the same algorithm in the ATLAS calorimeters.

(either electromagnetic or hadronic scale, see above), and the directions \(\eta\) and \(\phi\):

\[E = |\vec{p}|=\sqrt{p_{x}^{2}+p_{y}^{2}+p_{z}^{2}}\] \[p_{x} = p\cdot\frac{\cos\phi}{\cosh\eta}\] \[p_{y} = p\cdot\frac{\sin\phi}{\cosh\eta}\] \[p_{z} = p\cdot\tanh\eta\,.\]

The directions are fixed to the bin center in the \((\eta,\phi)\) grid for each tower, while they are reconstructed from the energy-weighted barycenter for topological clusters.

#### 2.5.4 Reconstruction flow for calorimeter jets

The general reconstruction algorithm flows for calorimeter jets are summarized in Fig. 6. They reflect the differences between tower and cluster signals. As already discussed, tower signals are on the electromagnetic energy scale while topological clusters are either on this scale or are calibrated on a local hadronic energy scale. Also, tower signals do not include noise suppression, while topological clustering has noise suppression built in.

Reconstruction sequence I: tower jetsJet reconstruction from calorimeter towers (left diagram in Fig. 6) starts with a re-summation step, which addresses a possible unphysical four-momentum due to

Figure 5: A simulated QCD dijet event with four jets in the final state, as seen at particle level and in the ATLAS calorimeters when using towers or clusters (extracted from Ref. [16]).

a negative (net) tower signal \(E_{\rm tower}<0\). This can be generated by signal fluctuations from noise (electronics and physics from pile-up) in the cells entering into the corresponding towers. Simply ignoring the negative signal towers enhances the contribution of positive noise fluctuations, but combining negative signal towers with nearby positive signals such that the combined four-momentum is physical with \(E_{\rm tower}>0\), leads to cancellations of some of the noise fluctuations and avoids signal biases. Only negative signal towers without nearby positive signals are completely dropped.

The resulting "protojets" represent either one or a few towers, and have all physically valid four-momenta. They are the input to the actual jet finding algorithm like seeded fixed cone or \(k_{\rm T}\). The outputs of the jet finder are then jets with energies on the electromagnetic energy scale. Their constituents are the original calorimeter towers. They are subjected to a cell signal based calibration discussed below in Section 2.5.5. After calibration, jets with \(p_{\rm T}<7\) GeV are discarded.

More refined corrections are needed to calibrate the tower jets to the particle level. Those include corrections for residual non-linearities in the jet response due to algorithm effects, like missing energy from the jet, or adding energy not belonging to the jet, in the jet clustering procedure. Other corrections include suppression of signal contributions from the underlying event and/or pile-up. Most of these can only be addressed in the context of a specific physics analysis.

Reconstruction sequence II: cluster jetsWhen topological clusters on electromagnetic energy scale are used for jet reconstruction, the reconstruction flow is rather similar to the tower jet reconstruction, see center diagram in Fig. 6. The main difference is the treatment of negative signals. Due to the symmetric noise cut applied in the cell selection in the clustering step, some clusters may have net negative signal as well. These can be ignored for jet reconstruction without significantly biasing the jet signal by positive noise contributions, because the noise suppression applied by the cell clustering already severely reduces any noise contribution. Some additional average cancellation is achieved by the symmetric noise cut, which allows inclusion of some negative cell signals even into positive (physical) clusters.

The cluster jets are initially on the electromagnetic energy scale as well. The same cell signal weighting functions used for tower jets are applied to initially calibrate these jets, with some additional corrections for the fact that these calibration functions have not been optimized for the cluster signals, see Section 2.5.5 for more details. Like in reconstruction sequence I, all jets with \(p_{\rm T}<7\) GeV after calibration are discarded.

Reconstruction sequence III: locally calibrated cluster jetsIn this sequence the input objects to jet finding are already calibrated to the local hadronic energy scale [17]. This means that after the jets are formed, they are also calibrated on this scale. Additional corrections needed are related to the fact that all calibrations and corrections for this particular scale have been derived from single pion response only. Additional jet energy losses due to loss of particles in the magnetic field in ATLAS, or in inactive material without leaving any signal above clustering threshold in the calorimeters, have to be corrected in the jet context itself, in addition to the corrections for the physics environment contributions already discussed for the tower jets. See the right hand side diagram in Fig. 6 for a schematic overview. Fully calibrated jets from this sequence with \(p_{\rm T}<7\) GeV are again discarded.

#### 2.5.5 Calorimeter jet calibration

The long standing calibration scheme for calorimeter jets in ATLAS is based on cell signal weighting. It can be applied to both tower and cluster jets from the reconstruction sequences I and II, respectively. The basic idea behind this approach, which was originally developed for the CDHS experiment [18] and further refined for the H1 experiment Ref. [19], is that low signal densities in calorimeter cells indicate a hadronic signal in a non-compensating calorimeter and thus need a signal weight for compensation of the order of the electron/pion signal ratio \(e/\pi\), while high signal densities are more likely generated by electromagnetic showers and therefore do not need additional signal weighting.

To apply the cell signal weighting, first all calorimeter cell signals contributing to a jet are retrieved. This is possible even if the jets have not directly been reconstructed from these cells. The signal in each cell \(i\) in the jet is weighted by a function depending on the cell location \(\vec{X}_{i}\) and the cell signal density \(\rho_{i}=E_{i}/V_{i}\), with \(E_{i}\) being the electromagnetic energy signal of the cell, and \(V_{i}\) being its volume. The weighting factor is \(\approx 1\) for high density signals and rising up to 1.5, the typical \(e/\pi\) for the ATLAS calorimeters, with decreasing cell signal densities. The weighting functions are universal in that they do not depend on any jet feature or variable. The calibrated jet four-momentum \((E_{\mathrm{jet,\,calo}},\vec{p}_{\mathrm{reco}})\) is then recalculated from the weighted cell signals, which are treated as massless four-momenta \((E_{i},\vec{p}_{i})\) with fixed directions:

\[\left(E_{\mathrm{jet,\,calo}},\vec{p}_{\mathrm{calo}}\right)=\left(\sum_{i}^{ N_{\mathrm{cells}}}w(\rho_{i},\vec{X}_{i})E_{i},\sum_{i}^{N_{\mathrm{cells}}}w( \rho_{i},\vec{X}_{i})\vec{p}_{i}\right)\,. \tag{1}\]

The signal weighting functions have been determined using seeded fixed size cone jets (\(R_{\mathrm{cone}}=0.7\)) in fully simulated QCD dijet events by fits of reconstructed calorimeter tower jet energies to matching Monte Carlo truth particle jet energies. Residual non-linearities (as function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) and non-uniformities (as function of \(\eta\)) are corrected by an additional calibration function parametrized in both variables. These corrections have also been calculated for other standard jet finding configurations and calorimeter signals. The calibration has been determined using the ideal, non-distorted detector geometries. See Ref. [17] for more details.

### Track jets

Finding jets in reconstructed inner detector tracks is useful to recover possible inefficiencies of the calorimeter signals, especially for jets pointing to transition or crack regions. Even though the scheme of seeding calorimeter jets with track jets in these regions has not been completely evaluated, some recovery may be possible. At least tagging of suspicious event topologies using track jets without matching calorimeter jet, or matching a poorly reconstructed calorimeter jet, allows a suppression of events with significant fake missing transverse momentum in the hadronic final state reconstruction, thus improving

Figure 7: The difference between jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) reconstructed from the calorimeter and the matching truth particle jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), for all jets with \(|\eta|<0.7\) and \(40<p_{\mathrm{T}}<60\), and jets from this sample in two regions of the track \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) fraction \(f_{\mathrm{trk}}\) defined in Eq.(2) (left). The plot in the center shows the relative difference \(\Delta p_{\mathrm{T}}/p_{\mathrm{T,truth}}\) for various bins of \(f_{\mathrm{trk}}\) and as function of the calorimeter jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The distributions of \(\Delta p_{\mathrm{T}}\) after applying these corrections are shown in the right figure. The lightly shaded area indicates the distribution for all jets, without any selection based on \(f_{\mathrm{trk}}\).

the quality of any given sample for physics analysis.

Matching the track jets with calorimeter jets is another promising approach to refine the jet energy measurement jet by jet, and the hadronic final state reconstruction in general. First, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) fraction carried by tracks, defined as

\[f_{\mathrm{ttx}}=\frac{P_{\mathrm{T,track}}}{P_{\mathrm{T,calo}}}\,, \tag{2}\]

with \(p_{\mathrm{T,track}}\) being the transverse momentum from tracks and \(p_{\mathrm{T,calo}}\) being the one reconstructed by the calorimeter, can be measured for each jet within the inner detector acceptance \(|\eta|<2.5\). It can then be used to (relatively) improve the jet energy measurement, as indicated in Fig. 7. The figure shows results obtained from simulations of QCD dijet processes of jets within \(|\eta|<0.7\) and \(40<p_{\mathrm{T}}<60\) GeV. Even though the calorimeter jet calibration performs well on average, there are residual dependencies of the individual jet signal reconstruction quality on the jet fragmentation, i.e. the particle composition of the jet, for which \(f_{\mathrm{ttx}}\) provides a handle for a relative correction which can be applied jet by jet. This fragmentation dependency can be understood in that jets with large \(f_{\mathrm{ttx}}\) have a larger amount of their energy carried by charged hadrons, which tend to generate a smaller signal in the non-compensating ATLAS calorimeters. The standard jet calibration based on the calorimeter cell signals alone cannot completely recover the corresponding signal loss. This is certainly one of the promising techniques for a relative jet energy scale correction in the context of a refined jet calibration, with the immediate goal of improving the relative jet energy resolution.

Jet finders usually cluster four-momentum in two dimensions, like azimuth \(\phi\) and pseudorapidity \(\eta\). Inner detector tracks in ATLAS have a reconstructed vertex associated, thus the \(z_{vtx}\) coordinate can be added as a third dimension to jet finding from these tracks, see Fig. 8. Jet clustering in \(\phi\), \(\eta\), and \(z_{vtx}\) then allows the assignment of a vertex to a matching calorimeter jet, which is especially of interest in events with multiple interactions from pile-up. In this case jets not associated with the primary vertex can be tagged as such, and removed from the final state in jet counting experiments, e.g. a \(W+n\) jets analysis.

Figure 8: Track jets in the horizontal (\(x,z\)) plane of a simulated event with multiple vertices. The left figure shows tracks assigned to cone jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>5\) GeV using the usual two-dimensional clustering algorithm in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\), with \(R_{\mathrm{cone}}=0.4\) (same line patterns and shades indicate same jet). Clearly tracks from different vertices can end up in the same jet. The right figure shows cone jets from three-dimensional clustering for the same event, explicitly including the track vertices (\(R_{\mathrm{cone}}=0.4\), \(\Delta z=10\)mm).

### Energy flow jets

In Section 2.6 some aspects of the use of jets from charged tracks reconstructed with the inner detector are discussed. Another approach to improve the jet energy measurement is to match the calorimeter response in towers or clusters with a charged track pointing to it, and use the track kinematics if the track momentum resolution is better than the calorimeter energy resolution for the matched cluster, which for hadrons in ATLAS is the case up to \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\approx 140\) GeV at \(\eta=0\). The principal method is referred to as _energy flow_ reconstruction, and was pioneered at LEP [20] and is in use in hadron colliders; for example, the CDF application is described in Ref. [21].

The most important feature of energy flow reconstruction is the removal of the calorimeter signal generated by an accepted track. In ATLAS this has been studied using a track-cluster match approach. Figure 9 shows the relative variation of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) resolution for cone jets from energy flow objects and topological clusters in QCD dijet production, both without final energy scale corrections. From this there are indications that for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\,\raisebox{-2.15pt}{$\stackrel{{<}}{{\sim}}$} \,80\) GeV in this environment, which is characterized by typically low event activity in general, the jet energy resolution can be improved by the energy flow technique. The expected gain is most significant at lower jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), e.g. about 15% (relative) at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=40\) GeV.

### Particle jets

Particle jets are only available in simulated events. They are built from stable particles produced by the fragmentation model in the physics generator. Stable particles in ATLAS are those with a laboratory frame lifetime of about 10 picoseconds or more, thus typically including electrons, muons, photons, charged pions, kaons, protons, neutrons, neutrinos, and their corresponding antiparticles. These particles represent the "truth" reference of a hard scattering process for performance studies and simulation based calibration approaches. The particle jets are therefore referred to as _truth particle jets_, or _truth jets_, in the following sections of this note.

Neutrinos and muons generated in the collision are excluded from these truth jets, as they have their own observables, i.e. missing transverse momentum for neutrinos and explicitly reconstructed tracks for

muons. Jet finding with generated particles uses the same code as calorimeter reconstruction, obviously excluding the signal preparation for towers in reconstruction sequence I and all calibration steps.

## 3 Jet reconstruction performance in ATLAS

The performance of the ATLAS detector for jet reconstruction has been evaluated within the present day limitations of physics generators, mostly PYTHIA [22], and detector response simulations, all performed with GEANT4 [23, 24]. All results presented here should therefore be considered to be expectations and of preliminary nature.

### Preliminaries

The comparisons of calibrated jet features discussed in this section uses calorimeter jets to which the cell signal based calibration has been applied, in addition to the overall scale correction for different jet finder configurations and calorimeter signal choices, i.e. jets from reconstruction sequence I and II introduced in Section 2.5.4, with calibrations applied as described in Section 2.5.5. As already discussed in that section, the parameters of the corresponding calibration functions have been determined using simulations of dijets from QCD processes with the ideal detector geometry, meaning no misalignment between detectors or detector elements, no detector shape distortions, and assuming a perfect knowledge of the material distribution from supports, services, cryostats, etc., in the complex ATLAS geometry.

The simulations performed for the evaluation of the jet reconstruction performance use the same generated physics, meaning the same events at particle level, but include small shifts in relative detector positioning and small changes to the amount (increased) and location (more realistic asymmetric distribution in pseudorapidity and azimuth) of dead material in the detector description. As a consequence, the calorimeters do not respond optimally for this evaluation with respect to jet signals, but the estimated performance is likely closer to the initial one in ATLAS, with some a priori unknown distortions, misalignments, and other imperfections.

Final corrections can be derived once experimental data from the detector become available with sufficient statistics by e.g. following the strategies lined out in Ref. [25]. For the performance expectations presented here these corrections, which could have been derived rather straight forwardly by using the misaligned detector geometry in the simulations for calibration as well, are intentionally not applied to probe some of the initial systematic uncertainties to be expected for the initial running of ATLAS. Note that none of the results presented here include pile-up.

### Comparing jet reconstruction algorithm performances

Jet reconstruction performance is typically expressed in terms of expected or measured signal linearity, i.e. flatness of the detector response to particle jets over the whole kinematic range of interest at the LHC (from \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\approx 10\) GeV to a few TeV), signal uniformity in pseudorapidity \(\eta\) and azimuth \(\phi\) over the whole detector system coverage, and the achievable energy resolution. Additional features of jet reconstruction performance are the efficiency to find jets, and the purity of the found jet sample, which is of course related to the number of fake jets reconstructed.

Other jet features studied with the ATLAS detector are the possibility to reconstruct the original source of a given jet. This is particularly interesting for heavily boosted heavy particle decays like for top quarks, where the final state will likely be reconstructed as just one (narrow) jet. The measurement of the jet mass and a substructure analysis are experimental tools which could address this question.

The quality of the reconstructed variables depends on the choice of the calorimeter signal (towers or clusters), the choice of the jet finder and its configuration (wide/narrow jets), and the ability to unfold as much as possible the physics environment, like reflected in underlying event and pile-up contributions. A high precision analysis of a given event topology may require different configurations than offered in default jet reconstruction to optimize the signal. In this section the expected effect of the choices discussed above on the performance variables is shown for selected configurations.

In most cases the performance is evaluated using a truth reference provided in the simulation by jets reconstructed at particle level, see Section 2.8. The detector and truth jets are associated through directional matching. The following list of variables is used:

**Jet directions**: are given by pseudorapidity \(\eta\) and azimuth \(\phi\). As \(\eta\) is directly related to the polar angle \(\theta\), and thus useful (even for massive jets) to understand the variations of the detector response, the rapidity \(y\) can be used for physics analysis motivated selections. The variables are defined as:

\[\eta = -\frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{p+p_{z}}{p-p_{z}}\right)=\,-\ln\left[ \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right] \tag{3}\] \[y = -\frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{E+p_{z}}{E-p_{z}}\right)\] (4) \[\phi = \arctan\left(\frac{p_{y}}{p_{x}}\right)\,. \tag{5}\]
**Matching radius**: \(R_{m}\) is defined by the directional distance between truth and detector jets, i.e.

\[R_{m}=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\,. \tag{6}\]

Two jets are matched if the radial distance between them is \(R_{m}\leq 0.2\), if not stated otherwise. Only one match is allowed for each reference (truth) jet. In case of two or more nearby jets, the one closest to the reference is taken for efficiency and purity studies. For signal linearity and uniformity studies the reference and the calorimeter jets are omitted in this case.
**Signal linearity**: can be determined by the ratio \(\lambda\) of the energy reconstructed for the calorimeter jet \(E_{\mathrm{jet,\,calo}}\) and the matched truth jet energy \(E_{\mathrm{jet,\,truth}}\),

\[\lambda=\frac{E_{\mathrm{jet,\,calo}}}{E_{\mathrm{jet,\,truth}}}\,, \tag{7}\]

when \(\lambda\) can be calculated as function of \(E_{\mathrm{jet,\,truth}}\) or \(E_{\mathrm{jet,\,calo}}\).
**Signal uniformity**: is measured by the variation of the signal as function of the jet direction in the detector frame, as given by \(\eta\) in Eq.(3). The variable \(\lambda\) defined in Eq.(7) can be used to estimate the uniformity from simulations, if calculated as function of \(\eta\).
**Relative energy resolution**: is given by the width of the distribution of the relative difference between \(E_{\mathrm{jet,\,calo}}\) and \(E_{\mathrm{jet,\,truth}}\):

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\sqrt{\left\langle\left(\frac{E_{\mathrm{jet,\,calo}}-E_{ \mathrm{jet,\,truth}}}{E_{\mathrm{jet,\,truth}}}\right)^{2}\right\rangle- \left\langle\frac{E_{\mathrm{jet,\,calo}}-E_{\mathrm{jet,\,truth}}}{E_{ \mathrm{jet,\,truth}}}\right\rangle^{2}}\,. \tag{8}\]
**Jet reconstruction efficiency**: \(\varepsilon\) is defined by the following ratio:

\[\varepsilon(R_{m})=\frac{\#\text{ matches of truth particle jets with reconstructed jets}}{\#\text{ truth particle jets}}=\frac{N_{m}^{\mathrm{jets}}(R_{m})}{N_{\mathrm{truth}}^{\mathrm{jets}}}\,. \tag{9}\]

It depends on the matching radius \(R_{m}\) and is determined as function of the true jet energy, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), or \(\eta\).

#### Jet reconstruction purity \(\pi\)

is given by

\[\pi(R_{m})=\frac{\#\text{ matches of truth particle jets with reconstructed jets}}{\#\text{ reconstructed jets}}=\frac{N_{m}^{\text{jets}}(R_{m})}{N_{reco}^{\text{jets}}} \tag{10}\]

and also depends on the choice for \(R_{m}\). The fake rate \(f(R_{m})\) is then given by \(f(R_{m})=1-\pi(R_{m})\).

Purity is calculated as function of the reconstructed jet energy, \(p_{\text{T}}\), and/or direction.

Additional variables reconstructed from jets, like substructure and shape measures, are discussed in Section 3.6.

### Comparisons of basic jet signal features

The main data source for the evaluation of the performance of the ATLAS calorimeters for jet reconstruction are fully simulated QCD dijet events with at least one of the hard scattered partons having a \(p_{\text{T}}\) within a certain bin. Eight bins are defined, with incrementing delimiters approximately following a \(2^{n}\) power law: \(17\to 35\) GeV, \(35\to 70\) GeV, etc., up to the final bin \(p_{\text{T}}>2240\) GeV with the upper limit set by the kinematic limit introduced by the parton direction and the 14 TeV center-of-mass energy in the \(pp\) collisions at LHC.

#### 3.3.1 Signal linearity and resolution

Signal linearity has been studied in detail for the evaluation of the various calorimeter jet calibration schemes under discussion in ATLAS [17]. The general expectation from these studies with the distorted detector is a response flat within \(\pm 1\%\) for jets with \(p_{\text{T}}\,{}^{>}_{\sim}\,50\) GeV, and a slightly larger deviation from linearity for jets with lower transverse momentum down to \(\sim 10\) GeV [17]. As the calibration functions are determined using one jet finder configuration and one simulated calibration sample in a perfect detector model (see discussion in Section 2.5.5), one can estimate the shift from a response flat within the margins introduced by the distorted detector when other configurations and/or a different calorimeter signal basis are considered. This shift can be expressed as the ratio of \(\lambda_{alt}\), as given in Eq.(7), from a given alternative jet reconstruction to \(\lambda_{ref}\), the reference from the same jet reconstruction configuration used to derive calibration functions in the ideal detector:

\[\xi=\frac{\lambda_{\text{alt}}}{\lambda_{\text{ref}}}=\frac{E_{\text{jet,\, calo}}^{\text{alt}}}{E_{\text{jet,\,calo}}^{\text{ref}}}\Big{/}E_{\text{jet,\, truth}}^{\text{alt}}\,. \tag{11}\]

The quantity \(\xi\) can be viewed as a measure of the residual calibration uncertainty with respect to the best calibrated jet reconstruction configuration, and is thus an estimate of one of the systematic uncertainty contributions in the general jet reconstruction. Note that

\[\xi\approx\frac{E_{\text{jet,\,calo}}^{\text{alt}}}{E_{\text{jet,\,calo}}^{ \text{ref}}}\]

when the alternative reconstruction uses the same jet finder with the same parameters as the reference, because \(E_{\text{jet,\,truth}}^{\text{alt}}\approx E_{\text{jet,\,truth}}^{\text{ref}}\) in this case. The prime example here is the comparison of seeded fixed cone tower jets with \(R_{\text{cone}}=0.7\) (the reference) with cluster jets found with the same configuration.

Figure 10 shows expectations for \(\xi\) as function of the jet \(p_{\text{T}}\) in two different regions of jet rapidity. From this simulation based study it can be concluded that the cell signal based jet calibration, with the additional overall scale corrections discussed in Section 2.5.5 applied, is universal for the distorted detectorFigure 11: Residual calibration uncertainty \(\xi\), calculated relative to the fixed seeded cone (\(R_{\rm cone}=0.7\)) tower jet calibration as described by Eq.(11), as function of the truth jet \(p_{\rm T}\) in the forward direction of ATLAS.

Figure 10: Residual calibration uncertainties for reconstructed jets from various jet finder configurations and the two calorimeter signals, as function of the truth jet \(p_{\rm T}\) and in two bins of jet rapidity \(y\). The reference configuration is seeded fixed cone tower jets with \(R_{\rm cone}=0.7\). The residual calibration uncertainty is given by \(\xi\), as defined in Eq.(11).

at a level of about 2% for the studied QCD jets with \(p_{\rm T}>20\) GeV and the particular choice of distortions implemented in the detector description of the simulation program. As these distortions include additional inactive material between the electromagnetic liquid argon and the hadronic tile calorimeter (about 10% increase in nuclear absorption length), the effect is in particular emphasized for low \(p_{\rm T}\) jets in the central region, which mostly occupy the \(0.4<|y|<0.4\) bin3. Here the sensitivity to the jet algorithm (seeded cone or \(k_{\rm T}\)), its configuration (narrow or wide jets), and the choice of calorimeter signals (clusters or tower) is also largest, see Fig. 10.

Footnote 3: Note that for the QCD jets under consideration here the jet mass \(m\) is generally small, in particular \(m\ll p\), i.e. \(y\approx\eta\).

Sensitivities to signal and jet finder choices are stronger for jets within \(3.7<|y|<3.9\). The calorimeter jet shape in the corresponding forward region is dominated by (lateral) hadronic shower extension rather than the particle flow in a cone in \((\eta,\phi)\), meaning that a considerable part of the calorimeter signal can be outside of a chosen jet cone and therefore be lost for the total jet signal. Jets from each of the jet finder configurations and calorimeter signal choices have been individually corrected for these signal losses using simulations with the ideal detector geometry. The effect of the distorted detector, which includes a change of the relative \(z\) position of the endcap and forward calorimeters in ATLAS and thus a change of the aspect ratio of the particle level jet shape to the calorimeter jet shape and consequently different energy losses, can be significant especially for the \(k_{\rm T}\) jets, as indicated in Fig. 11. Again using the seeded fixed-size cone tower jets with \(R_{\rm cone}=0.7\) as a reference, the cluster jets reconstructed with the same algorithm show a similar response, indicated by \(|\xi-1|<2\%\) in the whole kinematic range studied here. The narrow cone cluster jets lose about 1% of their energy, rather independent of their \(p_{\rm T}\), which can be expected due to the lateral hadronic shower size varying only slightly with energy. The larger effects of the distorted detector on the \(k_{\rm T}\) jets, like the prediction of a nearly linear rise of \(\xi\) with \(\log p_{\rm T}\) for \(p_{\rm T}\stackrel{{<}}{{{}_{\sim}}}100\) GeV for all considered \(k_{\rm T}\) jets, but most pronounced for wide \(k_{\rm T}\) tower jets, require more investigation of the distortion effects and their reflection in towers and clusters on the more complex dynamics driving the \(k_{\rm T}\) algorithm.

The jet energy resolution is the other important contribution to precision jet reconstruction. It has been evaluated in the distorted detector geometry with the same QCD sample. The results are again discussed in more detail in Ref. [17]. A typical relative energy resolution, calculated as described by Eq.(8), and achieved without particular corrections for the distorted detector, has a stochastic term of about \(60\%/\sqrt{E(\mbox{\leavevmode\nobreak\ \rm GeV})}\) and a high energy limit of about 3% in the central region of ATLAS, all determined with these simulated events.

It is expected that the relative energy resolution depends on the calorimeter signal choice, the jet algorithm, the underlying event and pile-up activity, and the general particle density and flow of the physics environment. Using QCD dijet simulations, with electronics noise included in the detector simulation but without any pile-up activity, the difference in resolution between tower and cluster jets can be estimated with the test variable \(\psi_{\sigma}\), which uses the fractional difference \(\Delta_{\sigma}\) in the energy resolution

\[\Delta_{\sigma}=\left(\frac{\sigma}{E}\right)_{\rm cluster}^{2}-\left(\frac{ \sigma}{E}\right)_{\rm tower}^{2}\,,\]

with the relative resolutions \(\sigma\left/E\right.\) as given in Eq.(8). \(\psi_{\sigma}\) can then be defined as

\[\psi_{\sigma}=\left\{\begin{array}{rcl}&\sqrt{\Delta_{\sigma}}&\mbox{for}& \Delta_{\sigma}>0\\ &-\sqrt{-\Delta_{\sigma}}&\mbox{for}&\Delta_{\sigma}<0\end{array}\right.\,. \tag{12}\]

Figure 12 shows the prediction for \(\psi_{\sigma}\) for various jet configurations in two different kinematic regimes defined by the jet rapidity. As this variable mainly folds differences in the stochastic and noise contribution to the jet energy resolution, the effect of noise suppression implicit for cluster jets is particularly visible at low energies and for wider jets, where more calorimeter cells with noise contribute to the tower

jets than in narrow jets. At higher jet energies, the energy resolution contribution introduced by signal fluctuations from electronics noise is significantly reduced and \(\psi_{\sigma}\) is comparable with zero in both kinematic regimes.

The relative difference \(\psi_{\sigma}\) can be transformed into an energy-equivalent difference in a straight forward manner:

\[\Delta\sigma_{\rm abs}(E)=\psi_{\sigma}(E)\cdot E\,. \tag{13}\]

Figure 13 shows predictions for this difference for the QCD jets discussed here. The general flat (energy independent) behaviour indicates that the differences between cluster and tower jets indeed are mostly related to electronics noise. The average noise contribution \(\langle\Delta\sigma_{\rm abs}\rangle\) has been determined by straight line fits to the flat regions. Seeded cone tower jets with \(R_{\rm cone}=0.7\) in the lower rapidity regime \(0.2<|y|<0.4\) yield \(|\langle\Delta\sigma_{\rm abs}\rangle|\approx 2.5\) GeV more noise than the corresponding cluster jets. This contribution is estimated to be higher for \(k_{\rm T}\) jets with \(R=0.6\), at approximately 4 GeV. \(|\langle\Delta\sigma_{\rm abs}\rangle|\) increases in the higher rapidity region \(2.0<|y|<2.2\) to about 6 GeV for cone and 8 GeV for \(k_{\rm T}\) jets, respectively. This observation already reflects the larger electronics noise in the endcap calorimeters, where most of the jets in this rapidity range go. The evaluation of \(\psi_{\sigma}\) as function of the jet direction, as shown in Fig. 15 in Section 3.4, explores this observation further.

Figure 13 also suggests that for \(E<50\) GeV, \(k_{\rm T}\) jets made from clusters in the lower rapidity regime are subjected to fluctuations from other sources than electronics noise, which partly cancel the noise reduction as \(|\Delta\sigma_{\rm abs}|\) gets smaller with decreasing energy. These fluctuations are not present in \(k_{\rm T}\) jets

A negative value for \(\psi_{\sigma}\) indicates a better resolution for cluster jets.

made from towers and in seeded cone jets reconstructed from towers or clusters in the same kinematic region, and need further exploration.

### Jet signal uniformity

The variation of the jet response as function of the jet direction is a measure of the uniformity of the jet signals and more powerful to diagnose possible detector inefficiencies than the linearity studies discussed in the previous section. Figure 14 shows the variation of the response to wide and narrow seeded cone and \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) tower jets as function of the jet pseudorapidity4 for simulated QCD dijet events. The additional inactive material introduced between the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters in the central region, which is part of the distorted detector geometry model, especially affects the response to the lower energy jets. The drop in the jet response is also more enhanced for lower energetic jets in the crack region around \(|\eta|\approx 1.5\), with up to 10% of signal loss, again due to more inactive material in this region. The response to the higher energetic jets is more uniform, as expected, with a signal drop in the cracks around 4%, which is also observed for the crack at \(|\eta|\approx 3.2\).

Footnote 4: Contrary to the preceding discussion of the signal linearity and energy resolution, where the rapidity \(y\) is used to categorize different kinematic regimes for jets, in the discussion of the signal uniformity the pseudorapidity \(\eta\) is preferred, as it directly reflects a direction in ATLAS (see Eq.(3) in Section 3.2) and thus is more appropriate to characterize the response in a certain calorimeter region.

There are only relatively small difference between the seeded cone and \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) jet signal uniformity, which are more pronounced at lower jet energies. Using clusters instead of towers as the calorimeter signal basis does not affect the signal uniformity for the higher energetic jets, but is expected to recover some signal losses, of the order of 1%, for the lower energetic jets.

Predictions for the dependency of the relative energy resolution on the jet direction is shown in Fig. 15, for the same QCD jet sample. From this study there are significant differences expected between the seeded cone and the \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) algorithm for lower jet energies. Both for wide and narrow jets the cone algorithm seems to perform better, especially in the endcap calorimeter region. For higher energetic jets these differences become insignificant.

Testing the difference between cluster and tower jet energy resolution has been done using the relative resolution difference \(\psi_{\sigma}\), as defined in Eq.(12). For the lower energetic jet sample the noise-like

Figure 13: Estimates for the absolute difference in resolution, as defined in Eq.(13) between seeded cone cluster and tower jets (\(R_{\mathrm{cone}}=0.7\), open circles \(\circ\)). The filled circles (\(\bullet\)) show the same difference for \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) cluster and tower jets, with \(R=0.6\). The solid and dashed lines show results and the range of fits to the data points. Note the linear energy scale and the limited energy range, compared to Fig. 12.

The upper two plots show the response variation as function of the jet pseudorapidity \(\eta\) for tower jets in two different jet energy ranges, while the lower plots show the signal difference between cluster and tower jets \(\Delta E_{\rm jet,\,calo}=E_{\rm jet,\,cluster}-E_{\rm jet,\,tower}\) as function of \(\eta\), again in two jet energy bins. The \(p_{\rm T}\) variation for the two energy bins is shown in the middle section, for comparisons.

contribution to \(\psi_{\sigma}\) already observed in Fig. 12 is confirmed, with the additional observation that in the endcap calorimeters clusters seem to reduce these fluctuations even more than in the central region. High energetic cluster and tower jets perform very similarly. From the absolute differences between the resolutions shown in Fig. 13, which is about \(2.5-8\) GeV depending on the kinematic regime and the chosen jet finder and its configuration, the expected value for \(\psi_{\sigma}\) for higher jet energies is about \(0.2-0.7\%\), which is in agreement with the predictions for the high energy jet sample shown in Fig. 15. The larger and positive \(\psi_{\sigma}\) at higher pseudorapidities observed especially for narrow \(k_{\rm T}\) jets indicates signal fluctuations introduced by clustering in the forward region. A more detailed investigation of the \(k_{\rm T}\) algorithm performance when configured for narrow jets in this region is under way.

### Efficiency and purity

The efficiency of the jet reconstruction in ATLAS depends not only on the jet \(p_{\rm T}\) but also on the jet direction and the physics environment. For basic performance evaluation it has been studied using QCD dijet production. Figures 16, 17, and 18 show the expectations for seeded cone jets with \(R_{\rm cone}=0.7\) and \(0.4\), and \(k_{\rm T}\) jets with \(R=0.4\) and \(0.6\), respectively, in various kinematic regimes defined by the jet rapidity \(y\). It is noticeable that the efficiency at lower \(p_{\rm T}\) is rather low, with the wide \(k_{\rm T}\) jets performing better than the corresponding wide cone jets. Both jet algorithms have similar efficiencies for narrow jets

Figure 15: Predictions for the direction dependence of the relative jet energy resolution for seeded cone (wide, \(R_{\rm cone}=0.7\), left, and narrow, \(R_{\rm cone}=0.4\), right) and wide (\(R=0.6\)) and narrow (\(R=0.4\)) \(k_{\rm T}\) tower jets in two different jet energy bins (upper plots). The relative resolution difference to cluster jets \(\psi_{\sigma}\), as defined in Eq.(12), is shown for the same jet samples in the bottom plots.

for \(0.2<|y|<0.4\), with increasingly better efficiencies predicted for \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets at higher rapidities.

Figures 16 through 18 also show the estimated differences in the jet reconstruction efficiency between tower and cluster jets, defined as \(\Delta\varepsilon=\varepsilon_{\mathrm{cluster}}-\varepsilon_{\mathrm{ tower}}\), with \(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{cluster}}\) and \(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{ tower}}\) defined in Eq.(9). In general cluster jets are expected to be reconstructed with higher efficiency in the low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) regime, especially in case of wide jets and in the forward direction. Narrow seeded cone jets are reconstructed with basically the same efficiency for both calorimeter signal choices, except at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\,{\buildrel<\over{\sim}}\,50\) GeV in the forward region, where cluster jets are again more efficient.

The predictions for \(\Delta\varepsilon\) for wide \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) indicate similar behaviour as the seeded cone jets in the central calorimeter region, but a much less pronounced difference between the tower and cluster jets in the forward region. There are also indications the narrow \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) jet reconstruction efficiency is slightly improved when using clusters, see again Fig. 16 through Fig. 18. No significant variation of the jet reconstruction efficiency as function of the jet direction is expected, especially not for higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets.

The fake rate \(f=1-\pi\) (see also Eq.(10)) for jet reconstruction in QCD dijet events has also been studied. The rate drops quickly from more than 50% at jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of 10 GeV to around 1% for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>50\) GeV. There are indications that wide jets reconstructed from topological clusters have a lower number of fakes at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), especially in the central region. Also, the \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) algorithm seems to generate fewer wide jets than the cone algorithm in this region, independent of the calorimeter signal choice. These differences are expected to be much smaller for narrow jets.

### Jet composition and mass

The reconstruction of jet masses and substructure has gained interest at LHC, especially because of the expected production of heavy particles with masses of \(\mathcal{O}(100)\) GeV and transverse momenta of several hundred GeV. These may decay hadronically into very collimated final states. An important standard model example is the \(W\) boson [26]. Other examples include SUSY [27], exited heavy quarks [28], and in exotic final states involving extra dimensions [29].

In any case, the complete final state of a heavy and boosted particle may be reconstructed into one jet, which in the example of a fully hadronically decaying top quark actually contains three highly collimated jets. The mass of the reconstructed jet is then one of the indicators of its origin, in addition to a possible substructure reconstruction reflecting the three "internal" jets.

The reconstruction of the jet mass is inherently difficult from calorimeter signals, as the shower development washes out the directions and energies of individual particles in the jet. In addition, the true jet mass is of course best reconstructed if all of its original particles can be measured at high precision. The mass reconstruction is thus disturbed by undetected particles, like the ones curling in the solenoidal magnetic field in the inner detector cavity of ATLAS, and the ones losing too much energy in upstream inactive material to generate a signal above threshold in the calorimeters.

Figure 19 shows the expected composition of \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets with \(R=0.6\) built from particles, towers, and clusters in three different rapidity regions. The number of constituents shown in this figure is of course depending on the calorimeter signal choice, i.e. towers or clusters. The variation in the number of clusters between the rapidity regions reflects the changing spatial resolution power of the calorimeter with respect to resolving individual showers inside a jet. The observation that the number of particles inside jets seems to drop at highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) indicates a change in the origin of the jets. Most jets at lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) in the studied QCD sample are gluon jets, while for higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) a significant fraction of jets is produced by quarks. As gluons have a larger probability to radiate off other gluons than quarks have, one can expect more particles inside gluon jets, and even more jets in the final state in case of gluons.

The relative sensitivity of the jet mass reconstruction to low signal contributions has been studied for cluster, tower and particle jets with QCD dijet simulations. The relative change in the jet mass if Figure 16: The calorimeter jet reconstruction efficiency \(\varepsilon\) in ATLAS, calculated from simulations using Eq.(9), for seeded cone tower jets with \(R_{\rm cone}=0.7\) and \(R_{\rm cone}=0.4\), as function of the truth particle jet \(p_{\rm T}\), in \(0.2<|y|<0.4\) (top left). The plot on the top right shows predictions for wide (\(R=0.6\)) and narrow (\(R=0.4\)) \(k_{\rm T}\) tower jet reconstruction efficiencies in the same kinematic regime. The difference in efficiency between cluster and tower jets, defined as \(\Delta\varepsilon=\varepsilon_{\rm cluster}-\varepsilon_{\rm tower}\), is shown in the lower left plot for cone and in the lower right plot for \(k_{\rm T}\) jets.

Here \(m(p_{\rm T}>p_{\rm T}^{\rm min})\) means the jet mass recalculated using only jet constituents with a transverse momentum above \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm min}\), while \(m(p_{\rm T}>0)\) is the jet mass using all constituents. Figure 20 shows the expectations for the variation of \(\Delta m_{\rm rel}\) as a function of the reconstructed \(m(p_{\rm T}>0)\), for different \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm min}\). Especially for high mass jets the cluster jets show a similar behaviour as the particle jets, indicating that clusters are probably better reflecting the particle composition in these jets than the tower jets. Note that \(p_{\rm T}>400\) MeV is around the threshold for charged particles to reach the calorimeter in the magnetic field of the inner detector, and is also close to the general signal threshold for the calorimeters in the central region of ATLAS.

### Jet substructure

The sensitivity in the mass reconstruction observed in Fig. 20 suggests the need for jet variables less sensitive to the soft particle contribution and response, yet providing sensitivity to the possible origin of the jet. One of the interesting variables is the characteristic scale \(y_{\rm scale}\) for sub-jet splitting in \(k_{\rm T}\) jets, i.e. the \(p_{\rm T}\) scale at which the \(n\) last recombinations of the \(k_{\rm T}\) algorithm are undone. It can be defined using \(y_{n}\) such that

\[y_{\rm scale}^{2}=p_{\rm T}^{2}\times y_{n}\,.\]

For example, \(n=2\) means splitting into two sub-jets, identical to undoing the last recombination in the \(k_{\rm T}\) algorithm. \(y_{\rm scale}\) is logarithmically below the jet \(p_{\rm T}\) in gluon and quark jets, due to the strongly ordered (in \(k_{\rm T}\)) QCD evolution, see e.g. Ref. [30]. In case of a strongly boosted \(W\) boson decaying into quark

The corresponding difference in efficiency between cluster and tower jets is shown in the bottom plots. See caption of Fig. 16 for more details.

and anti-quark, on the other hand, \(y_{\rm scale}\) is closer to the \(W\) mass \(m_{W}\). The left plot in Fig. 21 shows a qualitative comparison of the \(y_{\rm scale}\) spectrum for jets with masses \(m_{\rm jet}>40\) GeV in simulated QCD dijet processes with the one for jets from simulated boosted \(W\) boson decays with the same mass cut applied.

The resolution power of ATLAS for a measurement of \(y_{\rm scale}\) has been studied for splitting into two jets, i.e.:

\[y_{\rm scale}=\sqrt{y_{2}}\times p_{\rm T}\,,\]

with a sample of simulated highly boosted \(W\) decaying hadronically. For these the corresponding \(y_{\rm scale}\) distribution approximately peaks at \(m_{W}/2\), as expected, see Fig. 21. The resolution power for \(y_{\rm scale}\) can be evaluated by comparing this variable reconstructed from the calorimeter jet with the one from the matching particle level jet. The right plot in Fig. 21 shows the resolution for full simulation and for a smeared particle-level fast simulation. Pending a full scale evaluation in the context of a physics analysis, the present observation based on the the similarity of both distributions is that the reconstruction of \(y_{\rm scale}\) does not seem to be too sensitive to details affecting the calorimeter signal, like showering, limited acceptance for low energetic particles, and similar. The prediction for the experimental \(y_{\rm scale}\) resolution from this figure is about 12%, while the optimistic simulation based on four-momentum smearing predicts about 9%.

The filled area distribution shows the spectrum for \(\Delta y_{\rm scale}=y_{\rm scale,reco}-y_{\rm scale,truth}\) obtained with fully detailed simulations, while the solid distribution shows the optimistic estimate from a smeared particle-level calculation. Both distributions are normalized to unity.

## 4 Forward jet reconstruction and jets in minimum bias events

The ATLAS detector provides near hermetic coverage within pseudorapidities of approximately \(-4.9<\eta<4.9\). The forward region is particularly challenging for jet reconstruction, as the jets of interest often have rather low transverse momentum (at high energy) and are thus closer to the fluctuations introduced by pile-up at design luminosity at LHC. For example, in a jet cone with \(R_{\mathrm{cone}}=0.7\) one expects fluctuations in transverse momentum of the order of 12 GeV [31], meaning that the minimum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) which can safely be reconstructed is around 40 GeV. The estimates for jet performance in the forward region presented here have been calculated without pile-up, i.e. only electronics noise is folded into the reconstructed signals.

Events with depleted hadronic activity in the central region of the \(pp\) collisions are important signatures for discoveries, including but not limited to leptonically decaying Higgs bosons produced in vector boson fusion (VBF) events, like \(WW\) scattering. To reconstruct this signal with significant efficiency a central jet veto can be applied. The effectiveness of this veto can be understood from the efficiency to reconstruct jets in minimum bias events without hard scattering, and the rate for fake jet reconstruction. This has been studied with simulations for ATLAS and the results are presented in Section 4.2.

### Forward jets

Recent studies indicate that the detection of forward going (light quark) jets with pseudorapidities \(2.7\leq|\eta|\leq 4.9\) helps to significantly increase the discovery potential not only for heavy Higgs bosons [13], but also for intermediate mass Higgs bosons produced in VBF [32]. This region in the ATLAS detector features a complex calorimeter geometry in the transition region from the end-cap to the forward calorimeters. This leads to a loss of precision from the changing readout geometries. Some aspects of the performance of the ATLAS detector for these forward jets are discussed in this section.

The VBF events have a specific topology in that on average two hard _tag jets_ are produced by the two quarks radiated off the vector boson. Figure 22 shows predictions for the jet multiplicity distributions in these events, both over the whole detector acceptance (\(|\eta|<4.9\)), where most often the two tag jets are found, and in the forward direction (\(2.7<|\eta|<4.9\)) only. From this the expectation is in most events only one of the jets is going into the forward direction, at least for the particular Higgs boson mass considered here (\(m_{H}=120\) GeV). This observation is independent of the jet size for seeded cone and \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets.

The relative transverse momentum resolution for both forward seeded face and \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets in VBF produced \(H\to\tau\tau\to\mu\mu\) events is estimated at about 9% for \(20<p_{\mathrm{T}}<120\) GeV. Signal linearity is expected to be within \(\pm 2\%\) for these jets, at least for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\raisebox{-2.15pt}{$\;\stackrel{{<}}{{\sim}}\;$}30-40\) GeV, see Fig. 23. The precision achieved in the reconstruction of the jet kinematics for even lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), an attempt only realistic in low luminosity running at LHC, seems to be limited from this study to \(\approx 5\%\).

Predictions for the efficiency and purity of forward jets reconstructed with the seeded cone (\(R_{\mathrm{cone}}=0.4\)) finder are shown in Fig. 24. Here the indication is that using topological cell clusters as calorimeter signals for jet reconstruction makes jet reconstruction more efficient at the likely less relevant lower end of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\raisebox{-2.15pt}{$\;\stackrel{{<}}{{\sim}}\;$}30-40\) GeV), but generates more fake jets in the same \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range, i.e. has a lower purity in this region for this event sample. As both calorimeter signals reconstruct \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets with basically the same efficiency and purity in the whole kinematic range of interest for these VBF events, there is an indication that the splitting of cell signals to fill towers, which is predominant in the forward region, generates less seeds than the more integrating cell clustering, where cell signals are summed up rather than split and thus create more likely signal objects above the seed threshold. See also text and Fig. 3 in Section 2.5.1 for tower formation, and Section 2.5.2 for clustering.

The Higgs boson decays as \(H\to\tau\tau\to\mu\mu\). The right plot shows the multiplicities of forward going jets with rapidities \(2.7\leq|y|<4.9\).

### Jets in minimum bias events

Soft underlying physics, as generated by the underlying event in hadron colliders and the multiple soft interactions at high luminosity is an important source of jet production not directly related to the triggered hard scattering process of interest. For efficient application of a central jet veto, which is an important tool in background suppression in VBF produced Higgs boson events, it is crucial to understand the jet rate from soft interactions in this region, and the particular characteristics of these jets. The latter point is subject to ongoing studies, but first estimates on the jet multiplicity and rate from simulated single minimum bias events are available.

Figure 25 shows the expected average number of jets in these events as function of the \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold applied in the final jet selection, for various calorimeter signal definitions and the most commonly used jet finder configurations. The \(k_{\rm T}\) jet multiplicity for narrow (\(R=0.4\)) jets is rather independent of the calorimeter signal choice, while for wider jets (\(R=0.6\)) the cluster jets have a lower average multiplicity, i.e. are less problematic for a central jet veto. For seeded cone jets, the wider (\(R_{\rm cone}=0.7\)) tower and cluster jets have very similar multiplicities, while here the narrow tower jets (\(R_{\rm cone}=0.4\)) have a lower multiplicity than the cluster jets.

Predictions for the probability \(P\left(N_{\rm jet}\geq 1,p_{\rm T}>20~{}{\rm GeV},\eta_{\rm range}\right)\) of reconstructing at least one jet per single minimum bias event with \(p_{\rm T}>20~{}{\rm GeV}\) within a pseudorapidity range of \(|\eta|<\eta_{\rm range}\) is shown in Fig. 26. Narrow jets from towers and clusters behave rather similarly for both the seeded cone and the \(k_{\rm T}\) algorithm.

Wider jets are more often found in calorimeter tower jets than in topological cluster jets. In general the \(k_{\rm T}\) algorithm is less likely to reconstruct wider jets with \(R=0.6\) than the seeded cone is with \(R_{\rm cone}=0.7\). Here \(P\left(N_{\rm jet}\geq 1,p_{\rm T}>20~{}{\rm GeV},\eta_{\rm range}\right)\) has been calculated including the occasional jet from the minimum bias (soft or semi-hard) interaction as well as "true" fake jets from calorimeter signal fluctuations due to noise. Both lead to efficiency losses in an analysis selecting final states with no hadronic

The plot on the right shows the corresponding fake reconstruction rate as function of the transverse momentum of the calorimeter jet.

The jet veto efficiency in the region \(|\eta|<\eta_{\rm range}\) can be estimated from these curves as \(1-P\left(N_{\rm jet}\geq 1,p_{\rm T}>20~{}{\rm GeV},\eta_{\rm range}\right)\).

activity in a given region \(|\eta|<\eta_{\rm range}\). Note that the expectations for the jet veto efficiency discussed here are estimated by \(1-P\left(N_{\rm jet}\geq 1,p_{\rm T}>20~{}\text{GeV},\eta_{\rm range}\right)\) under the assumption that the minimum bias events generate a similar underlying activity as can be expected in signal events. An additional loss of signal events is associated with the multiple soft interactions from pile-up. One expects \(\sim 25\) minimum bias interactions per bunch crossing at the design luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}=10^{34}\text{cm}^{-1}\text{s}^{-1}\). Experimental effects introduced by the calorimeter readout can increase this number by another factor of 2, giving jet veto efficiencies in the order of \(95(50)\%\) for narrow jets with \(p_{\rm T}>20\) GeV at \(\mathcal{L}=10^{33}\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}(10^{34}\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^ {-1})\).

Reconstructing jets in minimum bias events can provide important information for the modeling of soft physics and on the underlying event for hard scattering processes if correlation effects are neglected. For example, the pseudorapidity distributions of \(k_{\rm T}\) jets with \(p_{\rm T}>10\) GeV are shown in Fig. 27. Most jets above threshold are centrally produced with \(|\eta|<1\) and reconstructed with some limited efficiency, both for towers and clusters. The fake rate for jet reconstruction at this \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold can be considerable (\(\mathcal{O}(30\%)\) in the same central region), but decreases quickly with increasing jet \(p_{\rm T}\), thus likely restricting the accessible experimental phase space to test jet production in soft or semi-hard proton collisions with precision on production rates or cross section.

## 5 Conclusions and outlook

ATLAS supports a highly configurable and flexible jet reconstruction framework, which can easily be adapted to accommodate new jet algorithms or signal definitions from the detectors. At the same time, a default set of configurations for jet finding strategies is provided: a seeded fixed cone algorithm with split and merge, and the \(k_{\rm T}\) algorithm, both with two different parameters controlling the size of the

The distributions for the calorimeter jets exclude fake jets, i.e. each reconstructed calorimeter jet is matched with a truth particle jet. The efficiency for jet reconstruction in these events is shown in the bottom plots.

reconstructed jet. For the seeded cone, cone radii of \(R_{\rm cone}=0.7\) and \(R_{\rm cone}=0.4\) are available. Similarly, the default choices for narrow and wide \(k_{\rm T}\) jets are distance parameters \(R=0.4\) and \(R=0.6\), respectively. For the detector jets, which are reconstructed from projective calorimeter towers or topological cell clusters, a calorimeter cell signal weighting based calibration is applied, with calibration weights derived from simulations with an ideal ATLAS detector geometry model, together with an additional jet energy scale correction parametrized in pseudorapidity and transverse momentum.

Performance predictions for a slightly misaligned and distorted ATLAS detector system have been extracted mostly from PYTHIA generated QCD dijet processes simulated through the detector with GEANT4. The emphasis in these studies was to estimate possible deviations from signal linearity and uniformity, the deterioration of the relative jet energy resolution, the effect on jet reconstruction efficiencies and the fake jet reconstruction rate for the first collisions, when the inactive material distributions and the alignment of detector components may not be well known. The corresponding pre-collision physics data estimates have been derived from Monte Carlo for the default jet configurations for the two considered calorimeter signal definitions (tower and cluster). A preliminary conclusion from these studies is that the signal linearity can likely be controlled at the level of \(2-3\%\), depending on the detector region. The effect of the combination of a particular calorimeter signal choice with a given jet reconstruction configuration has been found to be consistent with expectations, i.e. the noise suppression intrinsic to clusters can be observed. In general there are strong indications that the effect of uncertainties in the knowledge of the detector geometry only leads to a modest degradation of the jet reconstruction performance.

Special challenges to jet reconstruction in the forward direction or jet vetoes in the central region, have been evaluated and found to be of acceptable performance for physics analyses like vector-boson fusion produced Higgs boson events. Pile-up at high LHC luminosities leads to considerable degradation especially of the jet veto efficiency. Due the large uncertainties in the modeling of soft physics underlying and overlapping the \(pp\) collisions, a precise quantitative evaluation of this degradation needs to be postponed until experimental minimum bias data and other event topologies become available with sufficient data quality and statistics.

In preparation for the experimental data ATLAS is now focusing on "data only" calibration approaches using tools like \(p_{\rm T}\) balance in prompt photon production and in QCD dijets. Additional efforts are concentrating on the subtraction of the pile-up contribution to jets, which can be estimated measuring the (transverse) energy scattered into a given area in pseudorapidity and azimuth in minimum bias events.
