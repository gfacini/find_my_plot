###### Abstract

In this note the electron and photon selection potential of the event filter is studied. The offline software suite ATRECON is used to investigate the rejection power achievable within the stringent constraints in an online environment. We used the electro-magnetic calorimeter reconstruction, the xKalman and iPatRec pattern recognition packages, and for photon conversion finding xConver/xHouRec. The interplay between efficiency/rejection and the execution time of the algorithms is investigated for electrons and photons both at low and high luminosity.

A total efficiency of about \(75(73)\%\) for single electrons with \(p_{T}=20(30)\) GeV and a rejection of dijets (\(p_{T}>17\) GeV) of \(33500(42000)\) at low (high) luminosity can be retained while reducing the mean reconstruction time by a factor of \(\sim 3(8)\) with simple reconfigurations of ATRECON. Additional, the long tails seen in the reconstruction time distribution at the default settings are reduced significantly.

## 1 Introduction

The event filter is the last stage of the online event selection mechanism. It is located after the event building which assembles full events following a level 2 trigger accept. The event filter should reduce the data rate by a further order of magnitude by reconstructing the full event with more accurate calibration and alignment values than available on previous trigger levels. In contrast to level 2 where the latency is less than 10ms, the event filter can spend several seconds for one event.

The physics algorithms running on the event filter should be as similar as possible to the offline algorithms in order to prevent any bias from different reconstruction approaches. It is obvious that within the stringent time constraints of an online environment not the full offline reconstruction can be run. Therefore, the aim ofthese studies is to obtain some ideas how a gain in the algorithm performance can be achieved without loosing to much physics performance.

The electron and photon identification is an important benchmarking channel for the trigger at LHC. It is important for the searches of leptonic decays of the Higgs boson, studies of production and decay of W's and Z's as well as for calibration of the electro-magnetic (EM) calorimeter. A high rejection of jets by the trigger is mandatory to achieve the event rate reduction foreseen for the ATLAS triggers [1].

## 2 Technical Issues

### Reconstruction Software and Timing of Algorithms

The offline reconstruction software ATRECON1 is used as event filter software. It has been combined with the level 1 and level 2 trigger simulation package ATRIG. The combined physics ntuple (CBNT) introduced for the physics TDR [2] was extended with the level 1 and level 2 accepts/rejects (global and for each trigger menu defined) from ATRIG.

Footnote 1: All studies are done with the SRT/CVS version 0.0.33 or newer.

Timestamps measuring the algorithm execution times were added to the offline packages. For the electro-magnetic calorimeter reconstruction and the pattern recognition package xKalman new timestamps were introduced measuring the pure algorithm execution time, i.e. omitting all data access and initialisation steps. This should assure that the timing measurements are not affected by Fortran specific issues. These timing measurements are available in the CBNT, too.

For the timing measurements of jetRec and the conversion finding with xHourec and xConver, overall timing measurements of the execution times are used. The experience with xKalman shows that overall timing measurements are about 10% higher than pure algorithm timing.

All timing measurements were made on the ATLAS shift machines. Each machine is a HP K260 with quad 180MHz PA-8000 processors2. These processors are specified by HP to have 11.8 SPECint 95, which correspond to 118 CERN units (CU). However, test at CERN resulted in about 7 SPECint 95 (70 CU) with more realistic, i.e. lower, optimisation settings3. This number is also used in the Physics TDR [2].

Footnote 2: ATRECON does not take any advantage of the multiprocessor architecture. It runs on one CPU while the remaining CPUs are used by other processes.

### Datasets

We used electrons with \(p_{T}=20(30)\,\mathrm{GeV}\) at low (high) luminosity and dijets with \(p_{T}>17\,\mathrm{GeV}\). At low luminosity no pile-up events were superimposed, while at high luminosity in the average 23 minimum bias events were added to the signal event with the new pile-up method. In both settings electronic noise is added to the calorimeter without using a threshold.

### Detector Geometry

The electrons were generated with the geometry described in the Technical Design Reports [4, 5]. It is implemented by DICE 98_2. For the jet production the older DICE 97_6 geometry was used. In the latter version, the barrel electro-magnetic calorimeter extends beyond \(|\eta|=1.475\) up to \(|\eta|=1.5\) and is equipped with strips in the first sampling over the whole rapidity range. In addition, there are also strips in the end-cap region \(2.4<|\eta|<2.5\)[6]. In this study, this additional information is not used. The barrel cryostat design changed in DICE 98_2, leading to an increased material distribution in front of the calorimeter (increase of \(0.1-0.25X_{0}\) depending of \(\eta\)) [2].

## 3 Reconstruction with xKalman

For the reconstruction, each event is processed by ATRIG resulting in a flag indicating the level 1 and 2 decision. All events, regardless of the previous decision, are then reconstructed with ATRECON. ATRECON was configured to search clusters in the electro-magnetic calorimeter with more than a certain energy threshold, called \(E_{T\,\mathrm{min}}\). In a second step, the pattern recognition xKalman [7] is invoked. It uses the Kalman filter to identify tracks within a given region around the maximum energy deposition in the electro-magnetic calorimeter. This region is called road and is parameterised by the \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) half-sizes at the calorimeter. All tracks above a certain threshold, called \(p_{T\,\mathrm{min}}\), are reconstructed in finding recovering from bremsstrahlung.

The efficiencies are specified as percentage of reconstructed electrons to generated electrons on the given trigger step. In parenthesis the efficiency compared to the previous step is given, too. The jet rejection is calculated in respect to the generated jets with \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{t}>17\,\mathrm{GeV}\). In parenthesis the rejection compared to the previous step is specified. The reconstruction time is measured in seconds on the ATLAS shift machines. The three times given are needed to reconstruct 50%, 80%, and 95% of the events which passed LVL2.

### Baseline settings

The first step of these studies is to reproduce the numbers for the electron/jet separation obtained for the physics TDR[2], especially those of Pascal Pralavorio [8], with the combined-ATRIG/ATRECON package.

For the reconstruction, the standard settings \(E_{T\,\mathrm{min}}=5\,\mathrm{GeV}\), \(p_{T\,\mathrm{min}}=5\,\mathrm{GeV}\), and a road size of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.5\times 0.5\) are used. The applied cuts are described in Prlavorio's note [8]3. In this study the transition radiation information is not used.

\end{table}

\end{table}
Table 2: Efficiencies and rejections at different trigger levels for high luminosity, i.e. with pileup. The efficiencies are accurate to about \(\pm\)2% (absolute value). Only statistical errors are shown. The three times given are needed to reconstruct 50%, 80%, and 95% of the events which passed LVL2 on the ATLAS shift machines.

Tables 1 and 2 summarise the results obtained for low and high luminosity, respectively. The efficiencies agree fairly well the Pralavorio's values. The difference in level 1 arises from different calibrations used in this study compared to Pralavorio. The overall rejection (excluding the transition radiation) is comparable to Pralavorio. However, in the present study a larger fraction of the rejection is achieved only with the matching of the track with the electro-magnetic cluster. The reason for this discrepancy is not understood.

The reconstruction time is dominated by the pattern recognition with xKalman and in the high luminosity case far beyond the time budget for the event filter. Especially the long reconstruction times for a few events are striking. The reconstruction time of the electro-magnetic calorimeter is more uniform and dominated by the cluster finding process.

### Simple Approaches to Accelerate Reconstruction

In this section some simple ways to accelerate the reconstruction with ATRECON are discussed. Simple means, that there are no modifications to the code, but the parameter for the reconstruction are changed. This investigation of the parameter space should be independent of the actual implementation and will be also valid for the coming OO software.

#### 3.2.1 Road Size

The road size parameterises the extend of the \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) region in which a track is searched. This region is centred at the highest energy in the electro-magnetic calorimeter within a given cluster. It is rather obvious that for single particles this size can be much smaller than the default \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.5\times 0.5\) without loosing any efficiency. Therefore, the road size was diminished to \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\) and \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.2\). The latter setting should include most of electrons suffering from bremsstrahlung. As expected the efficiencies and rejections are virtually unchanged. The change of the reconstruction time for xKalman is shown in figure 1. At low luminosity, i.e. without pile-up, no big differences are seen (figures 1.a for electrons and 1.b for dijets). This is explained by the rather low occupancy of the tracker where most hits within a road belong to the signal track. This changes dramatically at high luminosity (figures 1.c for electrons and 1.d for dijets) where the occupancy is much higher. Therefore the reconstruction time can be significantly reduced by decreasing the road-size.

#### 3.2.2 Threshold on Electro-Magnetic Clusters

As shown in figure 2 the reconstruction time for xKalman scales approximately linear with the number of electro-magnetic clusters used as seeds, i.e. the time per seed is rather constant. A reduction of number of seeds should therefore decrease the reconstruction time for high luminosity. At low luminosity there is only one cluster coming from the signal electron. The most simple way to reduce the number Figure 1: xKalman reconstruction time for different road sizes shown for electrons (\(p_{T}=20\,\)GeV) (a) and dijets (\(p_{T}>17\,\)GeV) (b) without pileup, and for electrons (\(p_{T}=30\,\)GeV) (c) and dijets (\(p_{T}>17\,\)GeV) (d) with pileup. The time needed to reconstruct 50%, 80% and 95% of all events passing LVL2 is shown.

Figure 2: xKalman reconstruction time as function of number of seeds used for pattern recognition. Left for electrons (\(p_{T}=30\,\)GeV), right for dijets (\(p_{T}>17\,\)GeV) at high luminosity which were accepted by LVL2.

of seeds at high luminosity is to increase the energy threshold defining a cluster. This does not affect the efficiency as long as high-\(p_{T}\) objects are considered.

Figure 3 shows the reconstruction time of xKalman for different settings of \(E_{T\,\mathrm{min}}\) for dijets at low and high luminosity.

#### 3.2.3 Tracking Threshold

Figure 4 shows the reconstruction time of xKalman for different \(p_{T\,\mathrm{min}}\) used for searching of tracks. The time used is reduced significantly, while up to \(p_{T\,\mathrm{min}}=10\,\mathrm{GeV}\) the efficiency is not much affected.

#### 3.2.4 Summary

Tables 3 and 4 summarise the results for electron/jet separation obtained by using the best setting of the parameters discussed in the section, i.e. using a \(p_{T\,\mathrm{min}}=5\,\mathrm{GeV}\), a road size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\), and an EM threshold of \(E_{T\,\mathrm{min}}=10(15)\,\mathrm{GeV}\) for low (high) luminosities.

## 5 Reconstruction with iPatRec

### Introduction

iPatRec is an Atlas Inner Detector pattern recognition and track reconstruction package. The basic strategy is to initiate track finding from space-points in the precision tracker, thus exploiting the two-track resolution and relatively low occupancy of the outer pixel and SCT tracking layers. The innermost B-layer and TRT drift straws are used subsequently, to confirm tracks and improve the precision of the reconstructed quantities.

Reconstruction is performed in roads which join the vertex region to a seed region defined on the outer surface of the Inner Detector.

Space-point combinations from 3 different partitions form a track-candidate. Since by design the Inner Detector is expected to provide at least 6 space-points on a track, there is sufficient redundancy to allow for a reasonable level of detector inefficiency and for the confusion sometimes found in jet cores and at high luminosity. A local helix interpolation between the track-candidate space-points is used to associate the remaining hits and to take note of any "holes" (active detector traversed without a hit).

Track-candidates are extrapolated into the TRT taking into account magnetic field inhomogeneities. A histogramming technique is used to select the drift hits to be added to the track. This technique also resolves left/right drift ambiguities. Tight cuts are made on the straw residual (\(\sim 2\sigma\)), and on the ratio of found to expected straws, in order to limit high luminosity (and jet core) occupancy effects. Tracks are ranked by quality which is defined according to the status, the absence of holes and the track-fit probability (in order of precedence).

To be accepted, a track has to fulfil the following requirements:

1. number of precision hits \(\geq 7\)
2. a maximum number of holes in the discrete detectors:* \(\leq 3\) holes on primary tracks
* \(\leq 1\) hole upstream of last hit on truncated tracks
* \(\leq 1\) hole downstream of first hit on secondary tracks
3. track-fit probability \(>0.001\)
4. \(p_{T}>1\) GeV In addition, some cuts are embedded in the program:
5. uniqueness check: \(<50\%\) discrete hits shared with other accepted tracks
6. continuity check: a hit in the first 2 partitions or TRT confirmation
7. at least 3 space-points on the track (with no shared hits on the outer one)
8. \(|d_{0}|<2\) mm, \(|z_{0}|<200\) mm

### Assumptions

* The operating system involved in these studies is HP/Unix; a full optimisation was used during compilation.
* The measurements are performed on the Atlas shift machines.
* The executable used is ATRECON/CT: the reconstruction in the calorimeter and the tracking using iPatRec are enabled.

### Datasets

The performance of this trigger was measured using single electrons 20 GeV without pileup and 30 GeV with pileup, and dijets 17 GeV with and without pileup. I used the available statistics. All the events have detector noise added using a CNOI datacard.

### Results

#### 5.4.1 Benchmark iPatRec

Benchmarking iPatRec and EM calo:

\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|} \hline  & & Reconstruction time in & Reconstruction time in \\ Event type & Pile-up & EM calorimeter & ID with iPatRec \\  & & 50/80/95\% & 50/80/95\% \\ \hline electrons \(p_{T}=20\) GeV & no & 0.67/0.68/0.72 & 0.06/0.08/0.15 \\ electrons \(p_{T}=30\) GeV & yes & 0.77/0.91/1.20 & 2.11/2.57/3.02 \\ dijets \(p_{T}>17\) GeV & no & 0.78/0.90/1.07 & 0.29/0.46/0.83 \\ dijets \(p_{T}>17\) GeV & yes & 0.91/1.10/1.36 & 2.48/3.08/3.87 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 5.4.2 Electron efficiencies and jets rejection

The efficiency for track finding is determined from the study of single tracks in the absence and presence of pile-up. Efficiency is defined as the fraction of accepted reconstructed tracks. A reconstructed track is accepted if it has:

* number of precision hits \(\geq 7\)
* number of pixel hits \(\geq 2\)
* at least one associated B layer hit
* \(|d_{0}|<1\,\mathrm{mm}\).

In addition, to validate the track, a match between ET measured in the calorimeter and p measured in the Inner Detector is made. \(0.7<E/p<1.4\). All the cuts applied were compared with Trivan Pal's values documented in [9], keeping in mind that those studies are made in the "Coseners House", the old Inner Detector layout.
