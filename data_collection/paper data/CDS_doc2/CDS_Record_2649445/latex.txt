## 1 Introduction

The study of proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC provides an opportunity to study QCD in regimes of high parton density and high centre-of-mass energy with the expectations that final-state effects associated with a quark-gluon plasma will be small, if present at all. Furthermore, in nucleus-nucleus (A+A) collisions nuclear effects are present in both colliding objects, whereas in proton-nucleus (\(p\)+A) collisions the partons in the proton can be considered a relatively well understood probe of the nucleus. Therefore, \(p\)+A collisions serve a twofold purpose within the heavy-ion program at the LHC: to understand the nature of initial-state nuclear effects, and more generally Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects, and as a control system for A+A collisions.

Existing measurements of electroweak bosons in proton-lead collision at the LHC have consistently shown that pQCD calculations that use free nucleon parton distribution functions (PDFs) as inputs do a poorer job of describing data than calculations that use modified nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) [1, 2]. Similar results have been found with di-jet measurements [3]. However, the data, at the current level of precision, only weakly constrain the nPDFs.

In this note projections are made for measurements of \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons as well as photon-jet events in expected future proton-lead (\(p\)+Pb) collisions at the LHC with \(\sqrt{s_{{}_{\mathrm{NN}}}}\) =8.8 TeV. Three luminosity scenarios are considered: 0.5 pb\({}^{-1}\), 1 pb\({}^{-1}\), and 2 pb\({}^{-1}\). The first two scenarios correspond to lower and upper estimates of a single \(p\)+Pb running period at the LHC, and 2 pb\({}^{-1}\) corresponds to an optimistic scenario of two separate periods (likely one during Run 3 and one during Run 4). In the main body of the note projections are shown for 2 pb\({}^{-1}\), and they are repeated for the other luminosity scenarios in Appendix A. Appendix B shows \(W\) boson projections for \(\sqrt{s_{{}_{\mathrm{NN}}}}\) =8.16 TeV \(p\)+Pb collsions.

## 2 ATLAS detector

The ATLAS detector is described in detail in [4]. Significant upgrades to the ATLAS detector are expected to be installed for Run 4, in particular the Inner Tracker (ITk) [5]. The performance of the ITk in Pb+Pb collisions is discussed in Ref. [6]. For this note, performance improvements due to the ITk are not taken into account.

## 3 Projections

### \(W\) Boson Measurements in \(p\)+Pb

The measurement of \(W\) bosons in particular at forward rapidity in proton-nucleus collisions is an important input for nPDF global fits. To explore the resolution and prospects for increased statistical precision of the future data, different sets of predictions were made. For unmodified PDF predictions, events were generated with the Powheg generator [7, 8] and showered with Pythia8[9] using the CT14 PDF set [10]. By convention, the direction of the proton defines the positive rapidity direction. Both \(np\) and \(pp\) collisions were generated and combined in accordance with the proton and neutron content of the Pb ion. The derived nucleon-nucleon cross sections were then scaled by the A=208 of the target nucleus. The number of generated events was chosen to match the expected number of events in the expected luminosityscenarios. For nPDF predictions, the EPPS16 set [11] was used in the parton-level Monte Carlo generator MCFM [12].

Figure 1 presents projected measurements of differential cross-sections for \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) boson production in \(p\)+Pb collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=8.8\) TeV with integrated luminosities of 2 pb\({}^{-1}\). The cross-sections are calculated in the leptonic \(W\) boson decay channels within a fiducial phase-space region: \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}>25\) GeV, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\nu}>25\) GeV, \(m_{\mathrm{T}}>40\) GeV. As in existing measurements, the decay neutrino kinematics are inferred from the missing transverse energy, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), of the hadronic system recoiling from the \(W\) boson.

The projected statistical uncertainties on the cross-sections include the effect of an applied scale factor of 70% to account for lepton trigger, reconstruction and identification efficiencies, while systematic uncertainties are estimated based on previous ATLAS measurements of \(W\) boson production in \(pp\), \(p\)+Pb and Pb+Pb collisions [13, 14, 15]. For the projected luminosity, systematic sources of uncertainty dominate over statistical uncertainty. Considered sources of systematic uncertainty are:

* contributes 3% to the total systematic uncertainty

In addition to these sources of uncertainty the luminosity uncertainty is expected to be similar to previous \(p\)+Pb running in which it was less than 3% [1] (not shown in the figures).

Figure 2 presents projected measurements of the forward-backward ratios of differential cross-sections for \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) boson production. These ratios are particularly sensitive to possible nuclear modifications of PDFs, since some of the systematic uncertainties are largely reduced due to their being correlated between

Figure 1: Fiducial cross-sections for \(W^{+}\) (left) and \(W^{-}\) (right) boson production in \(p\)+Pb collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=8.8\) TeV differential in the charged lepton pseudorapidity measured in the laboratory frame \(\eta_{\mathrm{lab}}\). The cross-sections are projected with nuclear effects described by the EPPS16 nPDF set and without any nuclear effects using the CT14 PDF set with an integrated luminosity of 2 pb\({}^{-1}\). The boxes represent the projected total uncertainties (quadratic sum of statistical and systematic uncertainties), while vertical bars represent statistical uncertainties (smaller than the marker size).

forward and backward bins. In the presented projections, the systematic uncertainties coming from the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) resolution and the estimation of QCD multi-jet background are assumed to cancel out in the ratios.

Figure 3 presents projected uncertainties on measurements of the \(W\) boson yield ratio of central to peripheral collisions \(R_{\mathrm{CP}}\). In the \(R_{\mathrm{CP}}\) all non-centrality dependent (nPDF or other) modifications will cancel, and so the observable is well suited to studying centrality dependent effects. The peripheral reference consists of events from the 80-90% centrality class, while the central selections are the 0-5%, 20-30% and 60-70% centrality classes. Geometric parameters for these centrality classes, such as the mean nuclear overlap function, \(\langle T_{\mathrm{AB}}\rangle\), are calculated from the Glauber model [16] for \(p\)+Pb collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{{}_{\mathrm{NN}}}}\) =8.16 TeV. The statistical uncertainties on \(R_{\mathrm{CP}}\) are estimated assuming that binary scaling of \(W\) boson production holds and are dominated by the statistical precision of the peripheral reference. Systematic uncertainties contributed by all sources are assumed to vanish in the ratios, except for the contribution from the QCD multi-jet background estimation.

The boxes represent the projected total uncertainties (quadratic sum of statistical and systematic uncertainties), while vertical bars represent statistical uncertainties.

The boxes represent the projected total uncertainties (quadratic sum of statistical and systematic uncertainties), while vertical bars represent statistical uncertainties.

### Z Boson Measurements in \(p\)+Pb

Similar to \(W\) bosons, the measurement of \(Z\) boson production rates in \(p\)+Pb collisions is a precise probe of the lead nucleus. In particular, the rapidity distribution of \(Z\) bosons is sensitive to nPDF effects since it is directly related to the Bjorken \(x\) fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by the quark in the Drell-Yan process. Furthermore, the dependence of the \(Z\) boson yields on \(\langle T_{\rm AB}\rangle\), offers the possibility to test various models of how the nuclear collision geometry affects particle production in \(p\)+Pb collisions.

Events were generated using Powheg+Pythia8 and MCFM were prepared similarly to the \(W\) boson projections discussed in Section 3.1 (the CT10 PDF set [17] is used rather than CT14 with Powheg+Pythia8).

Figure 4 shows the rapidity differential cross for the free nucleon PDF (black markers) and nPDF set (open red markers). In the mid-rapidity region, \(-3<y^{*}<2\) (where \(y^{*}\) is the rapidity in the centre-of-mass frame) the statistical uncertainty is subdominant and the uncertainty is expected to be driven by the muon reconstruction uncertainty systematics on the per-mille level. A conservative 1% uncertainty is therefore plotted in that region. In the region \(y^{*}<-3\) and \(y^{*}>2\) the measurement will rely solely on the reconstructed forward electron candidates. The acceptance for reconstruction of these electron candidates is expected to extend up to \(|\eta|<4.9\) of the forward calorimeter (FCal). A systematic uncertainty of 5% in this region was extracted as the lower limit of the systematic uncertainty measured in Run 1 [1], this does not take into consideration the expected improvements due to the ITk detector upgrade. The statistical uncertainty was estimated by scaling the measured uncertainty of the Run 1 data by an appropriate factor accounting for the luminosity and centre-of-mass energy increase.

Figure 5 illustrates the momentum reach of the projected measurement obtained with the free nucleon PDF set. Systematic uncertainty on the \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm Z}\) differential cross-section is derived from the relative systematic uncertainty measured in the Run 1 data. For the high-\(p_{\rm T}^{\rm Z}\) points where the Run 1 measurement does not exist, the relative systematic uncertainty of the last measured point is taken as a characteristic uncertainty of the projected spectra.

In order to study the anticipated data precision in exploring different implementations of the nucleon-nucleus overlap geometry, projected results are presented as the centrality-dependent \(Z\) boson yields assuming binary collision scaling. Figure 6 shows the projected yield per inelastic nucleon-nucleon collision and divided by \(\langle T_{\rm AB}\rangle\). The projections are compared with the measurements in \(\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}\) =5.02 TeV proton-lead collisions in Run 1 [1]. Uncertainties on \(\langle T_{\rm AB}\rangle\) are derived from the Run 1 measurement, assuming no change in the model precision. Systematic uncertainties on the projected yields are estimated to be 1%. Statistical uncertainties are less than the marker sizes in each of the bins. In the previous study the uncertainties from the measurement of the \(Z\) boson yields were comparable to the uncertainties on \(\langle T_{\rm AB}\rangle\) whereas in the projected data the uncertainties of the boson analysis will be significantly smaller than those uncertainties. This may allow the \(Z\) boson yields to be used as an independent estimate of the \(p\)+Pb parton-parton luminosity [18]. Further, the added precision will enable finer binning in centrality.

The free nucleon PDF projection is obtained with the CT10 PDF set and the nPDF with the EPPS16 set. Statistical uncertainties are smaller than the marker size in the mid-rapidity region. Projected systematic uncertainties are described in the text.

Statistical uncertainties are everywhere smaller than the marker size, and projected systematic uncertainties (pink shaded boxes) are described in the text. The projections are compared with a previous Run 1 analysis [1]. Glauber model uncertainties are shown with hashed boxes.

### Photon + Jet Measurements in \(p\)+Pb

In addition to the measurements with heavy electroweak bosons described above, photon+jet events are an effective channel through which to probe nuclear effects in a precise manner. Using the kinematics of the high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) photon together with those of the highest-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jet in the opposite azimuthal hemisphere (the "leading jet") provides event-by-event sensitivity to the nuclear-\(x\) and \(Q^{2}\) of the underlying parton-parton scattering process.

Statistical projections are constructed using Pythia8 photon+jet events, using the NNPDF 2.3 LO parton distribution function set [19], and including both direct and fragmentation photon processes as is commonly done in ATLAS measurements of photon production [20, 21, 22]. Jets are defined by applying the anti-\(k_{t}\)[23] algorithm with \(R=0.4\) to stable particles. Projections are shown as a function of photon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and pseudorapidity in the centre-of-mass frame (\(\eta^{*}\)) selections corresponding to the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter acceptance, with positive and negative sides shown separately, as these probe different regions of nuclear \(x\). These projections include an estimated combined efficiency of 90% for photon reconstruction, identification and selection [22].

Figure 7 shows the expected double-differential photon yield accessible in 2 pb\({}^{-1}\) of 8.8 TeV \(p\)+Pb collisions. The closed circles denote the total double-differential photon yield. The open circles show the yield of photon+jet pairs in which the leading jet is required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV, to be within the ATLAS acceptance of \(|\eta|<4.9\), and to be balanced by a photon with an azimuthal angle difference (\(\Delta\phi\)) greater than \(3\pi/4\). Above \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}>50\) GeV, essentially all photon+jet pairs meet these criteria and can thus be used to tag the parton-level kinematics.

To approximate possible effects of nPDF modifications on the cross section, the Pythia events are reweighted on an event-by-event basis by the value given by the EPS09 nuclear PDF set [24] for the flavor, \(x\), and \(Q^{2}\), of the parton in the "nuclear" beam (in the particular generated event). Figure 8 demonstrates one way to evaluate how the photon+jet data is sensitive to nuclear PDF modification. Although the dependence of the cross-section on the PDFs is more complicated than the method used here, since the expected modifications are small and smoothly varying with the chosen kinematic variables, this approximation is sufficient to gauge the possible size of nPDF effects. The figure shows the projected statistical uncertainties on a measurement of the nuclear modification factor \(R_{p\mathrm{Pb}}\), given as a function of the nuclear-\(x\) values, \(x_{A}\), taken directly from Pythia. The modification of the cross-section in each \(\eta\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bin shown in Fig. 8 is plotted as a function of the mean \(x_{A}\) in Pythia for events in each kinematic selection. The kinematic selections for the photon+jet pair are the same as those described above for Fig. 7. The central values are set to be equal to those predicted by the EPS09 nuclear PDF set, as a way of demonstrating the ability of the data to be sensitive to the magnitude of the nuclear modification effects.

In this study, only the expected statistical uncertainties have been evaluated and the magnitude of possible systematic uncertainties have not been explicitly estimated. Previous measurements of jet and photon production in \(p\)+Pb collisions in Runs 1 and 2 [22, 25] have achieved small (\(<\)5%) uncertainties on jet and photon production cross-sections in a broad kinematic ranges. Furthermore, many sources may be correlated with the comparison \(pp\) data and thus cancel in ratios such as the \(R_{p\mathrm{Pb}}\). Reference data from \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=8.8\) TeV would be ideal for the \(R_{p\mathrm{Pb}}\) measurement, uncertainties on the order of a few percent are expected for a reference based on an extrapolation of \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV \(pp\) collisions. Further improvements to the systematic uncertainties are also expected or the Runs 3 and 4 measurements, where the larger event statistics will allow for more precise data-driven studies.

Closed markers denote the yield of events with a \(p_{\rm T}\) photon, while open markers denote the subset of those which also include a balancing jet above threshold in the ATLAS acceptance. The bottom panel below shows the projected statistical uncertainties.

The panels show projections for photon+jet events in different selections on the photon pseudorapidity measured in the centre-of-mass frame. The central values are set to be equal to the predictions of the EPS09 nuclear PDF set. Statistical uncertainties on the \(pp\) reference are neglected.

### \(Z\) boson + Jet Measurements in \(p\)+Pb

In addition to photon+jet events in \(p\)+Pb collisions discussed in section 3.3, \(Z\) boson+jet events may also be studied. Although the \(Z\) boson production cross section is lower compared to photons, \(Z\) boson+jet events have some advantages both theoretically, _e.g._ the large \(Z\) boson mass sharply reduces fragmentation and decay contributions, and experimentally, _e.g._ smaller backgrounds. Therefore \(Z\) boson+jet events are used to complementarily study similar questions as those studied with photon+jet events. The anticipated yield of the produced \(Z\) bosons in the LHC Runs 3 and 4 allows for a precise measurement of the momentum balance between the produced boson and the opposite-side leading jet in the event. This is a valuable measurement in \(p\)+Pb collisions to study possible nPDF and CNM effects in general. Furthermore, there are some indications that nuclear effects not usually categorized as CNM can produce rapidity dependent modification of jet production [25], and so the momentum balance is presented for different selections on the jets' rapidity.

Leptonic \(Z\) boson decays generated using Powheg+Pythia8 with the CT10 PDF set, prepared similarly to the event generation discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, are used for these projections. The jets are clustered at truth level with the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with a radius parameter \(R\)=0.4. The \(Z\) boson and lepton kinematics are defined at the Born level, excluding final-state radiation. The number of generated events corresponds to the expected number of \(Z\) boson candidates with transverse momentum above 35 GeV for luminosity of 2 pb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s_{{}_{\mathrm{NN}}}}\) = 8.8 TeV. Events for the analysis are selected by applying the fiducial lepton cuts of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) >20 GeV and \(|\eta|\)<2.5 in the laboratory frame. \(Z\) boson candidates are further required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) >60 GeV. The opposite side leading jet is required to be correlated in azimuth with \(|\Delta\phi|\)>7/8\(\pi\) and with the transverse momentum above 30 GeV.

Figure 9 shows the distribution of the \(Z\)-jet momentum balance, \(x_{\mathrm{JZ}}=p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}/p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{Z}}\) for three different slices in the jet pseudorapidity: forward (\(2<\eta<4.5\)), mid-rapidity (\(|\eta|<1\)) and backward jets (\(-4.5<\eta<-2\)). The distributions are normalised per \(Z\) boson candidate. The forward and backward jets show a slightly different \(x_{\mathrm{JZ}}\) distribution compared to the mid-rapidity jets. It is expected that there may be modification of these distributions relative to the calculations without nPDF modification shown in Figure 9 related to the observations of rapidity dependence of jet \(R_{\mathrm{pPb}}\) in Ref. [25]. The systematic uncertainties are derived from the leading jet energy scale (JES) uncertainties typical for the Run 2 LHC measurement [26], and amount to 1% in the midrapidity region and 3% in the forward/backward region. Figure 10 shows the average of the distribution, \(\langle x_{\mathrm{JZ}}\rangle\), as a function of the recoiling jet pseudorapidity in the centre-of-mass frame.

## 5 Conclusions

Different selections on the jet pseudorapidity in the centre-of-mass frame are shown in different colors. The \(Z\) boson and leading jet are required to be correlated in azimuth with \(|\Delta\phi|\)\(>\)7/8\(\pi\) and are selected with \(p_{\rm T}\)\(>\)60 GeV and \(p_{\rm T}\)\(>\)30 GeV for the \(Z\) boson and the jet, respectively.

## 4 Summary

This note presents projections for electroweak boson and photon+jet measurements in \(p\)+Pb collisions in LHC Runs 3 and 4 with the ATLAS detector. Cross-sections considered in rapidity, centrality, and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons are presented. Photon+jet nuclear modification factors as a function of \(x_{A}\), and \(Z\) boson+jet momentum balance distributions are also presented. These projections are representative of future measurements sensitive to nuclear parton distributions.
