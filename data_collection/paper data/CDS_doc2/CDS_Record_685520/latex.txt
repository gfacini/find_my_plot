###### Abstract

The \(e/\pi\) separation performance of the ATLAS Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) by means of the **T**ime **o**ver **T**hreshold method is reported in this note.

Introduction

The Transition Radiation Tracker of the ATLAS detector is a combined straw drift tube and transition radiation detector designed to provide powerful pattern recognition capabilities and electron identification via transition radiation [1]. Particle identification in the ATLAS TRT will mostly be achieved by counting the number of hits exceeding the high threshold discriminator level [2]. A complementary method based on low threshold hits was shown to be possible [3].

During the last few years, several TRT sector prototypes, using different iterations of the TRT front end electronics, have been built and tested in the H8 beam line at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). Tests have been done using different beams of particles with different energies. The experimental setups used in those tests were varying very often according to the type of tests needed.

This year's (2002) tests were essential to validate the final design of the TRT front end electronics chips. After a long iteration process, the ATLAS TRT community decided to use the DMILL technology for the production of the ASDBLR chips, while the DTMROC chips will be manufactured using a relatively cheap technology known as the Deep Sub Micron technology [4].

In this note, we will report on the TRT performance in terms of electron/pion separation at \(p\)=20 GeV by means of the Time over Threshold method using the 2002 testbeam data. A similar analysis was also done with the July 2000 testbeam data taken with 5 GeV pion and electron beams for 200 eV/5 keV low/high thresholds. The later analysis will be briefly mentioned and a comparison with the 2002 analysis is done. The comparison is, in some sense, not relevant for several reasons. The beam energies used were different, the front end electronics technologies used in those tests were very different, and the gas mixtures were also differents. In this note, the previous analysis will be more as a reference. \(e/\pi\) separation by means of the standard technique, the cluster counting method, is also studied and a comparison made with previous studies.

This report will be organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to a description of the Time over Threshold method (ToT). Section 3 describes the experimental setup, the alignment of the the TRT prototype, as well as the procedure used to correct the position of the track inside straws. As a first step of the analysis, a random straw was chosen for the time over threshold measurements. However the number of hits per straw was very small. Assuming that all straws have similar response to the passage of a charged particle, the statistics was enhanced by combining hits from several straws in the TRT sector prototype. The time over threshold measurements for 200 eV/5 keV low/high thresholds will be presented in section 4 as well. A track crossing the ATLAS Transition Radiation Tracker will cross on the average 35 straws, and about 90 % of those will give a hit whose efficiency depends partially on pseudorapidity and largely on luminosity. The tested sector prototype contained only 16 straws along the beam axis (\(z\)) and 8 planes in (\(\phi\)). In order to simulate a true situation where the ATLAS-TRT is functional, pseudotracks were created. A description of the used procedure is described in section 4, and finally a conclusion is drawn in section 5.

## 3 Experimental setup

The experimental setup, shown in Figure 3, included a radiator prototype, a single straw for high rate study, a TRT sector prototype consisting of 16 layers of straws along the beam direction (\(z\)), and three straws placed in a magnetic field. Track reconstruction was made by two multiwire beam chambers (BC1 and BC2) with a coarse resolution but with excellent noise properties, placed on both sides of the TRT sector prototype.

Three silicon detectors (Si1, Si2, and Si2) with an intrinsic accuracy of about 10 \(\mu\)m guaranteed a very precise reconstruction of the beam track position in the straws. Each silicon detector is formed by two microstrips planes oriented respectively along the (\(x\)) and (\(y\)) directions. Si1 and Si2 were placed on both sides of the TRT sector prototype. Si3 was placed few meters behind the TRT sector prototype, and was meant for the reconstruction of the beam track in the three straws prototype placed inside the magnets. Two small scintillators (S1 and S2) were used in coincidence as a trigger. Two Cerenkov detectors (Ch1 and Ch2), a multiplicity counter (M), a lead-glass calorimeter and a preshower were also readout and used for particle identification.

Signals from the sector prototype straws were read out using ASDBLRs and DTMROCs [5]. Signals straws were amplified, shaped, and two fold discriminated in the ASDBLR. The discriminated signals were then fed into the time digitiser (DTMROC) where the time of the leading and trailing edges of the low threshold discriminator signal and the possible presence of the high threshold discriminator level were determined. The straws were filled with a gas mixture (70%Xe + 27%CO\({}_{2}\) + 3%O\({}_{2}\)) with a gas gain of

2.5\(\times\)10\({}^{4}\). The stability of the gas was ensured by using a high voltage feedback loop with an accuracy better than 1%.

The track reconstruction, in the absence of a magnetic field, was performed using simple linear extrapolations. A coarse track was reconstructed using hits from the beam chambers. An extrapolation to the silicon detectors was done to refine the track fit. The silicons hits were associated to the track candidate if the hits were found within a 1 mm window. Then, the track was extrapolated to the straw, and the anode wire was aligned by centering the track coordinate within the 4 mm diameter, Figure 4 (left). The residual between the predicted position of the track within the straw and the position calculated using the drift time information obtained from the Rt dependence fit was thus minimized. A spatial resolution of 138 \(\mu\)m was achieved for a 400 eV low threshold, and the resolution was as good as 126 \(\mu\)m for a 200 eV low threshold, Figure 4 (right).

Time over Threshold measurements

In this section, a detailed investigation of the Time over Threshold method for 200 eV/5 keV low/high thresholds is presented. As mentioned earlier, in order to enhance the statistics, several straws were combined. Those straws were required to be very well aligned and fully illuminated by the beam, as shown in Figure 5. In the following, the plots are shown for the 2002 testbeam data unless stated otherwise. Figures for the 400 eV/5 keV thresholds will be shown whenever it is necessary. The correlation between the uncorrected time over threshold and the distance of closest approach to the anode wire for 20 GeV pions without high threshold hits is plotted in Figure 6 (left).

The parametrization of the time over threshold upon the closest distance to the anode wire was done by dividing a straw into bins of 200 \(\mu\)m width each, and then by evaluating the time over threshold for each bin. A fit with a cubic polynomial allows to determine the parametrized time over threshold \(\mathrm{ToT}_{\pi}^{\mathrm{fit}}\), which if subtracted from the measured time over threshold gives a quantity, independent of the distance of closest approach, Figure 6 (right).

**Figure 6: Parametrization of the dependence of the time over threshold on the distance of closest approach to the anode wire for 20 GeV pions for single hits (left). Correlation between the corrected ToT residuals, \(<\Delta_{ToT}>\), for pions and electrons (right).**

In principle, the values for pions should be centered around zero, while those for electrons should be a bit shifted upwards. However, this is hardly seen from Figure 6 (right). This effect could be seen more clearly from Figure 7, where the corrected residual, \(\Delta_{ToT}\), distributions for both pions and electrons excluding high threshold hits are plotted.

This effect is enhanced when one combines several measurements along a track. A track crossing the TRT will cross on average 35 straws, and a large fraction of those will give a hit above the low level threshold. Obtaining a full information on the passage of a track would have required the use of a bigger TRT sector prototype. However, the same information can be built using different test beam events. Pseudotracks can be created by combining 35 hits taken randomly from all hits with a gaussian spread of three hits. By averaging the time over threshold residuals for the n-straws along a pseudotrack, a discriminating variable, \(<\Delta_{ToT}>\), is formed:

\[<\Delta_{ToT}>\,=\frac{\sum_{i}\Delta_{ToT}^{i}}{n}\qquad\mbox{ for}\quad i=1,...,\mbox{n} \tag{2}\]

In Figure 4, this variable is plotted for pseudotracks for hits without the high threshold discriminator level (left), and when considering all the hits (right) for 2002 (top), and for 2000 (bottom) testbeam data. In both cases, when considering all the hits, the residual \(<\Delta_{ToT}>\) gives a larger shift between electrons and pions compared to the case when only low threshold hits are considered.

On the other hand, the cluster counting method for electron/pion separation is based on the different numbers of transition radiation created by a track along its path. The distributions of the number of high threshold hits along the reconstructed pseudotracks are shown in Figure 9.

The left plot represents \(<\Delta_{ToT}>\) without high threshold hits, the right plot is for all hits.

When \(<\Delta_{ToT}>\) is averaged over all the hits collected along a pseudotrack path, the correlation between \(<\Delta_{ToT}>\) and the number of high threshold hits is stronger, Figure 10 (right), than when only low threshold hits are considered in \(<\Delta_{ToT}>\), Figure 10 (left).

Performance in terms of electron/pion separation, for both Time over Threshold and the cluster counting methods, is shown in Figure 11 where the pion misidentification probability is calculated as a function of the electron efficiency. The later is set by requiring that \(<\Delta_{ToT}>\) is above some limit. The pion misidentification probability is then defined as being the fraction of pions passing that limit. The pion misidentification probability versus the electron efficiency is shown (closed squares) for the 2002 testbeam data when considering all the hits for the Time over Threshold method. A pion misidentification probability of 50% has been found for a 90% electron efficiency. In a previous study with the 1999 testbeam data [7], a pion misidentification probability of 10% was found for the same electron efficiency at the same momentum. A similar analysis was done using the 2000 testbeam data with 5 GeV beams of pions and electrons at 200 eV/5 keV thresholds in order to validate the analysis. For a 90% electron efficiency, a 2.8% pion misidentification probability was achieved. Similar results were found with the 1999 testbeam data.

In this year's tests, the discrimination power of the Time over Threshold method has been shown to be compromised. There are several reasons behind this performance drop, mostly due to the change of the pulse shaping function in the new ASDBLR chip.

## 5 Conclusion

The new changes in the front end electronics design for the ATLAS-TRT have seriously affected the discrimination power of the Time over Threshold. The incorporation of a new shaping function in the ASDBLR chip, which is less sensitive to different kinds of signals has been shown responsible for the Time over Threshold performance degradation for electron/pion separation. However, the \(e/\pi\) separation performance of the TRT by means of the cluster counting method remained unchanged.

The next year's testbeam is very essential since, for the first time, a complete TRT module fully equipped with the final electronics chips will be tested. Pion and electron beams are expected to be available with momenta as low as 5 GeV. A full analysis of both the Time over Threshold and the cluster counting methods is expected to be performed, and a comparison with the Monte Carlo simulation will be made after incorporating all the necessary information and adjustments into the official reconstruction code.
