###### Abstract

We estimate the potential for observation at the LHC of a doubly charged Higgs boson, as predicted in Left-Right symmetric models. Single production by vector boson fusion, \(W^{+}W^{+}\rightarrow\Delta^{++}_{L,R}\) and pair production by the Drell-Yan process \(q\bar{q}\rightarrow\Delta^{++}_{L,R}\Delta^{--}_{L,R}\) are considered. Various decay channels are investigated: dileptons, including pairs of \(\tau\)'s, as well as \(WW\).

One major puzzle of the Standard Model is the fact that weak interaction couplings are strictly left-handed. In order to remedy this apparent arbitrariness of nature, one must extend the gauge group of the Standard Model to include a right-handed sector. The simplest realization is a Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM) [1] based on the group \(SU(2)_{L}\otimes SU(2)_{R}\otimes U(1)_{B-L}\). Variants of this model derive generally from Grand Unified Theories [2], including superstring inspired models, based on extended groups which contain the LRSM as a subgroup. The breaking of \(SU(2)_{R}\otimes U(1)_{B-L}\to U(1)_{Y}\) occurs at a high energy scale due to a triplet of complex Higgs fields 1, consisting of \(\Delta_{R}^{0}\), \(\Delta_{R}^{+}\) and \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\), when its neutral component acquires a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value. The Higgs sector of the model therefore contains a doubly charged Higgs boson, which could provide a clean signature at the LHC since charge conservation prevents it from decaying to a pair of quarks. This will be the subject of the present work. For this purpose, we refer to previous phenomenological studies [4, 5, 6, 7], expanding the analyses by including the effects of backgrounds as well as detector acceptance and resolution.

Footnote 1: alternative minimal Left-Right symmetric models exist with only doublets of scalar fields [3]. They do not lead to Majorana couplings of the right-handed neutrinos

The LRSM has a number of interesting features. The enlarged symmetry group implies the existence of new heavy right-handed gauge bosons \(W_{R}\) and \(Z_{R}\), while the fermion sector is enriched by representing the right-handed fermions as doublets in \(SU(2)_{R}\). Yukawa couplings of the triplet Higgs allow for Majorana mass terms of the right-handed neutrinos, giving rise to the see-saw mechanism [8] as a natural explanation for the low, but non-vanishing mass of left-handed neutrinos. These heavy neutrinos further provide a mechanism for leptogenesis.

Other signatures of the LRSM have been studied in ATLAS. New heavy \(Z^{\prime}\) gauge bosons can be observed in channels \(Z^{\prime}\rightarrow\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) up to masses of 4.5 TeV [9, 10] with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). In analyses specific to the LRSM, the search of \(W_{R}\rightarrow\ell\nu_{R}\) yields limits on the observability of the \(W_{R}\) and right-handed Majorana neutrino [11], as a function of the masses of these particles. The channel \(Z_{R}\rightarrow\nu_{R}\nu_{R}\rightarrow\ell q\bar{q}^{\prime}\ \ell q^{\prime \prime}\bar{q}^{\prime\prime\prime}\) should be observable [12] up to masses \(M_{W_{R}}\mathrel{\hbox to 0.0pt{\raise 2.1973pt\hbox{$<$}}{\lower 2.1973pt\hbox{ $\sim$}}}\ 4\) TeV and \(m_{\nu_{R}}\mathrel{\hbox to 0.0pt{\raise 2.1973pt\hbox{$<$}}{\lower 2.1973pt \hbox{$\sim$}}}1.2\) TeV with 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). The new gauge bosons can also be searched for [13, 14] in the channels \(Z_{R}\to WW\to e\nu jj\) and \(W_{R}\to WZ\) if non-negligible mixing exists with the Standard Model (SM) gauge bosons. As a complement to these searches, observation of a doubly charged Higgs would clearly provide an important confirmation of the nature of the new physics.

The Higgs sector [4] of the LRSM consists of (i) the right-handed complex triplet \(\Delta_{R}\) mentioned above, with weights (0,1,2), meaning singlet in \(SU(2)_{L}\), triplet in \(SU(2)_{R}\) and \(B-L=2\), (ii) a left-handed triplet \(\Delta_{L}\) (1,0,2) (if the Lagrangian is to be symmetric under \(L\leftrightarrow R\) transformation); and a bidoublet \(\phi\) (1/2,1/2,0). The vacuum expectation values (vev) of the neutral members of the scalar triplets, \(v_{L}\) and \(v_{R}\), break the symmetry \(SU(2)_{L}\times SU(2)_{R}\to U(1)_{Y}\) as well as the discrete \(L\leftrightarrow R\) symmetry. The non-vanishing vev of the bidoublet breaks the SM \(SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)_{Y}\) symmetry. It is characterized by two parameters \(\kappa_{1}\) and \(\kappa_{2}\), with \(\kappa=\sqrt{\kappa_{1}^{2}+\kappa_{2}^{2}}=246\) GeV. To prevent flavour changing neutral currents (FCNC), one must have \(\kappa_{2}\ll\kappa_{1}\), implying minimal mixing between and \(W_{R}\). The mass eigenstate of the singly charged Higgs is a mixed state of the charged components of the bidoublet and of the triplet.

In the analysis below, in order to have a manageable number of parameters, we relate the mass of \(W_{R}\) to \(v_{R}\) by: \(m_{W_{R}}^{2}=g_{R}^{2}v_{R}^{2}/2\), which is a valid approximation in the limit where \(v_{L}=0\) and \(\kappa_{1}\ll v_{R}\). All the above parameters have bounds [7]: custodial symmetry constrains \(v_{L}\ \raise 1.29pt\hbox{$<$\kern-7.5pt\lower 4.3pt\hbox{$\sim$}}\ \ 9\) GeV and present Tevatron lower bounds on \(M_{W_{R}}\) impose a limit \(v_{R}>1.4\) TeV, or \(m_{W_{R}}>650\) GeV, assuming equal gauge couplings \(g_{L}=g_{R}\). Indirect limits on the mass and couplings of the triplet Higgs bosons, obtained from various processes, are given in [15].

The paper is organized as follows: The next section discusses the phenomenology of the doubly charged Higgs at the LHC. Sect. 3 describes the methods of simulation of signals and background, as well as detector effects. The following two sections give results on the observability of the \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\) and \(\Delta_{L}^{++}\) respectively in various decay channels. The last section summarizes and concludes.

## 2 Phenomenology of the doubly-charged Higgs boson

Single production of a doubly charged Higgs at the LHC is possible via vector boson fusion, or via the fusion of a singly-charged Higgs with either a \(W\) or another singly charged Higgs, as shown in Fig. 1. The amplitudes of the \(W_{L}W_{L}\) and \(W_{R}W_{R}\) vector boson fusion processes are proportional to \(\upsilon_{L,R}\). The other diagrams are suppressed by the Yukawa coupling of the Higgs to the quarks and by a coupling \(\phi\phi\Delta\) proportional to the small parameter \(v_{L}\). For the case of \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\) production, the vector fusion process therefore dominates. For the production \(WW\to\Delta_{L}^{++}\), the suppression due to the small value of the \(v_{L}\) is somewhat compensated by the fact that the incoming quarks radiate a lower mass vector gauge boson.

Double production of the doubly charged Higgs is also possible via a Drell-Yan process, with \(\gamma\), \(Z\) or \(Z_{R}\) exchanged in the \(s\)-channel, but at a high kinematic price since enough energy is required to produce two heavy particles. In the case of \(\Delta_{L}^{++}\), double production may nevertheless be the only possibility if \(v_{L}\) is very small or vanishing.

The decay of a doubly charged Higgs can proceed by several channels. Dilepton decay provides a clean signature, kinematically enhanced, but the branching ratios depend on the unknown Yukawa couplings. Present bounds [7, 15] on the diagonal couplings \(h_{ee,\mu\mu,\tau\tau}\) to charged leptons are consistent with values \(\,O(1)\) if the mass scale of the triplet is large. For the \(\Delta_{L}^{++}\), this may be the dominant decay mode if \(v_{L}\) is very small. One would then have a golden signature: \(q\bar{q}\to\gamma^{*}/Z^{*}/Z^{\prime*}\to\Delta_{L}^{++}\Delta_{L}^{--}\to 4\ell\). The decay \(\Delta_{R,L}^{++}\to W_{R,L}^{+}W_{R,L}^{+}\) can also be significant. However, it is kinematically suppressed in the case of \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\), and suppressed by the small coupling \(v_{L}\) in the case of \(\Delta_{L}^{++}\). Furthermore, reconstruction of \(W_{L,R}\) pairs is difficult at the LHC since they don't produce a resonance and since \(W_{R}\) decays involving heavy Majorana neutrinos lead to complex events.

In the present work, we consider the production and decay modes discussed above. The results will be presented as limits in terms of the couplings \(v_{L}\) or \(v_{R}\), taking fixed reference values for the Yukawa couplings of the doubly charged Higgs bosons to the leptons. It will then be a simple matter to re-interpret the results for different values of these Yukawa couplings. We will assume a truly symmetric Left-Right model, with equal gauge couplings \(g_{L}=g_{R}=0.64\). Since the mass of the \(W_{R}\) is essentially proportional to \(v_{R}\), as mentioned in the introduction, it will not be an independent parameter.

We note that the existence of the Higgs triplet can also be detected in the decay channel \(\Delta^{+}\to WZ\). This will not be studied here, as the signal is very similar to narrow techicolor resonances which have been analyzed elsewhere [16].

## 3 Simulation of the signal and backgrounds

The processes of single and double production of doubly charged Higgs is implemented in the PYTHIA generator [18]. Events were generated using the CTEQ5L parton distribution functions, taking account of initial and final state interactions as well as hadronization. The following processes were studied here:

* \(W^{+}_{R,L}W^{+}_{R,L}\rightarrow\Delta^{++}_{R,L}\to e^{+}e^{+}/\mu^{+}\mu^{+}\)
* \(W^{+}_{R,L}W^{+}_{R,L}\rightarrow\Delta^{++}_{R,L}\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{+}\) with one or both \(\tau\)'s decaying leptonically.
* \(q\bar{q}\rightarrow\gamma^{*}/Z_{R,L}\rightarrow\Delta^{++}_{R,L}\Delta^{--}_ {R,L}\)

The process \(W^{+}_{R,L}W^{+}_{R,L}\rightarrow\Delta^{++}_{R,L}\to W^{+}_{R,L}W^{+}_{R,L}\) has not been considered. The case of left-handed \(W\)'s was previously studied [17] in the framework of the little Higgs model and is discussed briefly in Sect. 5.2.

Detector effects and acceptance were simulated using ATLFAST [20], a fast simulation program for the ATLAS detector. Conditions of high luminosity (\({\cal L}=10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) were assumed. Jets were reconstructed from calorimeter clusters using a cone algorithm, with a cone radius \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}=0.4\). Charged leptons (electrons and muons) were reconstructed within the acceptance range in pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.5\). They were considered isolated if they were separated by \(\Delta R>0.4\) from other clusters and if, within a cone of radius 0.2, less than 10 GeV transverse energy was deposited. An efficiency of reconstruction of 90% was assumed for these leptons. Reconstruction of \(\tau\) jets assumed

Figure 1: Feynman diagrams for single production of \(\Delta^{++}\)

an efficiency of 40% with a corresponding mistagging probability of \(\sim\)0.05% for a central \(\tau\) jet having 100 GeV of transverse momentum.

The principal backgrounds depend on the production and decay process under consideration. PYTHIA was used to generate \(t\bar{t}\) production, which has a very large cross section of 500 pb. Other backgrounds were simulated using the CompHep generator [19]: (i) The process \(qq\to W^{+}W^{+}qq\) was produced with cuts at generation requiring transverse momentum of the outgoing quarks to be \(>15\) GeV and an invariant mass of the \(W^{+}W^{+}\) system greater than 200 GeV. CTEQ5L parton density functions were used, with \(Q^{2}=m_{W}^{2}\). With an assumed Higgs mass of 120 GeV, the contribution of longitudinal gauge boson scattering is very small. (ii) \(qq\to W^{+}Zqq\) was generated under similar conditions. (iii) Finally the process \(pp\to Wt\bar{t}\) was also generated with CompHep. The cross sections of these processes are given in Table 2.

A number of systematic uncertainties, some of which are difficult to evaluate reliably before experimental data are available, will apply. No k-factors have been used here, although next-to-leading-order corrections can be substantial for these high mass resonance states. The luminosity measurement is expected to have a precision of \(\sim 5-10\%\). The efficiency of lepton reconstruction in ATLAS, here taken to be 90%, will have to be better understood. The energy resolution, especially for high energy electrons, must be evaluated with full detector simulation and optimized reconstruction algorithms. Charge misidentification was not included here since it is small (\(\sim 5\%\) for leptons having a transverse momentum of 1 TeV).

## 4 Search for \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\)

A different analysis strategy has been applied for each of the four modes of production and decay of the bileptons described in Sect. 2. As mentioned above, since the Yukawa couplings to leptons are not known, we will not account for branching ratios into the various decay channels, but the reach on the parameter \(v_{R}\) could be recomputed trivially for any given values of these branching ratios.

We will only consider signals for doubly positively charged Higgs bosons, as they are about 1.6 times more abundant than the negatively charged ones, at the LHC (see Table 1). The same ratio of positively charged to negatively charged leptons can be expected from the backgrounds, to the extent that \(qqWW\) dominates, and hence the improvement in the significances obtained below can be estimated at 22%.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline M(\(\Delta_{R}^{++}\)) & \% of ++ \\ \hline \hline
300 & 64.5 \\ \hline
500 & 67.5 \\ \hline
800 & 71.5 \\ \hline
1000 & 75.3 \\ \hline
1500 & 79.1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Percentage of positively charged \(\Delta_{R}\) as a function of mass. A value \(m_{W_{R}}=650\) GeV was assumed.

### Dilepton channel

The backgrounds relevant to the two-lepton channel are shown in Table 2. A requirement of the presence of at least two leptons (\(e\) or \(\mu\)) has been applied, except for the \(t\bar{t}\) sample, where only one lepton was required. Although the cross sections are quite large, compared to those of the signal, given in Table 3, they can be effectively suppressed by appropriate cuts, as will be seen below.

#### 4.1.1 \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\to e^{+}e^{+}/\mu^{+}\mu^{+}\)

The selection criteria for this channel were the following:

1. Two isolated leptons (\(\ell=e,\mu\)) of positive charge were required. The ATLAS trigger requires that at least one of the leptons must have a transverse momentum \(>25\) GeV. The invariant mass of the two leptons, \(M_{\ell\ell}\) was then computed.
2. Since the leptons are expected to be energetic, an additional requirement that both of them have a transverse momentum \(p_{T}>50\) GeV was imposed.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Background & Number of Events & \(\sigma\times BR\) (fb) \\ \hline \hline pp \(\rightarrow\) W\(\bar{t}\bar{t}\) & 200 000 & 23 \\ \hline qq \(\rightarrow\) W\({}^{+}W^{+}\)\(qq\) & 100 000 & 37 \\ \hline qq \(\rightarrow\) WZqq & 27 000 & 28.6 \\ \hline qq \(\rightarrow\)\(t\bar{t}\) & \(P_{t}\) 10-200 GeV & 8 000 000 & 90 800 \\ \hline qq \(\rightarrow\)\(t\bar{t}\) & \(P_{t}\) 200 GeV-\(\infty\) & 2 000 000 & 14 100 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Background processes for the dilepton channel. The third column gives \(\sigma\times BR\), where \(BR\) is the branching ratio to a final state with at least two leptons, except for \(t\bar{t}\) where only one lepton is required. The number of events used for the analysis is also shown.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline M(\(W_{R}^{+}\)) & \multicolumn{5}{c|}{M(\(\Delta_{R}^{++}\))} \\ \cline{2-5}  & 300 & 500 & 800 & 1000 & 1500 \\ \hline \hline
650 & 7.9 & 4.6 & 2.2 & 1.4 & 0.45 \\ \hline
750 & 4.7 & 2.8 & 1.4 & 0.87 & 0.31 \\ \hline
850 & 2.9 & 1.8 & 0.90 & 0.58 & 0.21 \\ \hline

1500 & 0.30 & 0.20 & 0.11 & 0.074 & 0.029 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Cross section (fb) for the process \(p+p\rightarrow\Delta_{R}^{\pm\pm}\) as a function of the mass of the \(\Delta\) and of the \(W_{R}\).

3. The total transverse energy of the two leptons is correlated with the mass of the \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\) from which they originate (see Fig. 2). A mass-dependent cut was therefore applied: \(\alpha(p_{T}^{\ell_{1}}+p_{T}^{\ell_{2}})-M_{\ell\ell}=\beta\), where the values \(\alpha=2.4\) and \(\beta=480\) GeV were chosen to suppress background without significant loss of signal
4. The two partons from which the vector bosons have been radiated are expected to produce jets of high energy in the forward and backward regions. A forward jet tagging was therefore required: 1. After ordering all the jets with \(p_{T}>15\) GeV in decreasing order of energy, the first one, \(j_{1}\), was considered a candidate forward-tagged jet if its energy was higher than 200 GeV. 2. Looping over the remaining jets, the second candidate forward-tagged jet, \(j_{2}\), was identified if its angular separation from \(j_{1}\) satisfied \(|\eta_{j_{1}}-\eta_{j_{2}}|>2\) and if its energy was greater than 100 GeV.
5. The missing transverse energy was required to be less than 100 GeV. This cut was not applied for cases \(\Delta_{R}^{++}>800\) GeV since it was not needed to reduce the background.

Table 4 shows the number of events expected from the various backgrounds and for typical cases of signal where \(m_{\Delta_{R}^{++}}=300\) or 800 GeV and \(m_{W_{R}^{+}}=650\) GeV, after

Figure 2: Distribution of the scalar sum of the two lepton transverse energies as a function of their invariant mass. In green (light shade) are shown the distributions for signals of \(m_{\Delta_{R}^{++}}=300,800\) and 1500 GeV and \(m_{W_{R}}\)=650 GeV. The sum of the backgrounds is in black. The straight line indicates where the mass-dependent cut is applied.

successive application of the cuts. A window of \(\pm 2\times\) the width of the reconstructed mass of the \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\) was selected. The numbers are normalized to a luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). Fig. 3 shows the distribution of \(m_{\Delta_{R}^{++}}\) and backgrounds for the case \(m_{\Delta_{R}^{++}}\) = 800 GeV.

Since the background is negligible, discovery can be claimed if the number of signal events is 10 or higher. With this definition, the contour of discovery, in the plane \(m_{W^{+}_{R}}\) versus \(m_{\Delta_{R}^{++}}\) (or \(v_{R}\)) has been estimated from a sample of test cases. The discovery reach at the LHC is shown in Fig. 4, for integrated luminosities of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) and assuming 100% BR to lepton pairs.

#### 4.1.2 \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{+}\)

It is possible that the predominant decay of the \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\) will be to the third generation leptons if the Yukawa couplings are proportional to mass. For this important decay channel, the cleanest signal of \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{+}\) will be the one where the two \(\tau^{\prime}s\) decay leptonically. Although neutrinos are involved in the process, the mass of the tau pair can be reconstructed, as was done for example in \(H/A\rightarrow\tau\tau\) studies [10]. One must neglect the mass of the \(\tau\) mass lepton and assume that the neutrinos from the decay \(\tau\rightarrow\ell\nu\ell\nu_{\tau}\) are collinear with the charged lepton. This is a good approximation to the extent that \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\) is heavy and the \(\tau^{\prime}s\) are highly boosted. Defining \(x_{\tau 1}\) and \(x_{\tau 2}\) as the respective fractions of tau energy carried by the charged lepton, conservation of transverse momentum yields values for these variables and the invariant \(\tau\tau\) mass can then be calculated:

\[m_{\tau\tau}=\frac{m_{\ell\ell}}{\sqrt{x_{\tau 1}x_{\tau 2}}} \tag{1}\]

The same method of reconstruction applies for 1-prong or 3-prong hadronic decays of the \(\tau\).

\(\tau^{+}\tau^{+}\rightarrow\ell^{+}\ell^{+}p_{T}^{miss}\)

Assuming 100% decay of \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\) to tau pairs, the cross section for the process \(p+p\rightarrow\Delta_{R}^{\pm\pm}\rightarrow\tau\tau\rightarrow\ell\nu\nu\ \ell\nu\nu\) is the same as in Table 3, but the branching ratio BR(\(\tau\rightarrow\ell\nu\nu\)) of

Mass windows \(\pm 2\sigma\) around the resonances have been chosen. In parentheses is shown the number of events without the mass window cut.

\(35\%\) per \(\tau\) must be taken into account. Besides the backgrounds of Table 2, we have also taken into account \(Zjj\), for which details on the generation can be found in [21].

The following selection criteria were applied to extract the signal from the backgounds:

1. two isolated leptons of same charge were required in the event, with \(p_{T}>25\) GeV. The event trigger is thus satisfied.
2. the calculated variables \(x_{\tau 1}\) and \(x_{\tau 2}\) were required to lie within the physical range \(0\leq x_{\tau i}\leq 1\). Events for which sources of missing energy other than the neutrinos from the two tau decays are present, or for which the collinear approximation made above is not valid, will be lost.
3. in order to reduce the \(t\bar{t}\) background, the event was rejected if a \(b\)-tagged jet was present.
4. forward jet tagging was required as in Sect. 4.1.1
5. Missing transverse momentum was required to be at least 150 GeV

Table 5 shows the number of events expected from the various backgrounds and for the cases of signals where \(m_{\Delta R}^{++}\) = 300 and 800 GeV and \(m_{W^{+}_{R}}=650\) GeV, after successive application of the cuts. A window of \(\pm 2\times\) the width of the reconstructed mass of the \(\Delta^{++}_{R}\) was selected. Fig. 5 shows the distribution of \(m_{\Delta^{++}_{R}}\) and backgrounds for \(m_{\Delta^{++}_{R}}=800\)

The signal (green) is for a mass \(m_{\Delta^{++}_{R}}=800\) GeV with \(m_{W_{R}}\) = 650 GeV and the background is in red. The black histogram is the sum of both. The distributions are for 100 fb\({}^{-1}\).

GeV. A significance \(S/\sqrt{B}\) of only about 4.3 is obtained in this case for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). With simultaneous search for the \(\Delta_{R}^{--}\), and with 300 fb\({}^{-1}\), the significance should reach 9.1. Contours of discovery in this channel, defined as a \(5\sigma\) significance with at least 10 events, is shown in Fig. 6. We note that they are weaker than for \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\rightarrow\ell^{+}\ell^{+}\) of Fig. 4, and do not cover a large region of mass which is unconstrained (\(m_{W_{R}}>650\) GeV). However, it may help to confirm discovery, or may be more applicable if the coupling to \(\tau\)'s dominates.

\(\tau^{+}\tau^{+}\rightarrow\ell^{+}hp_{T}^{miss}\)

Analysis of this channel shows that the background from \(W\) + jets will completely dominate the signal. Therefore, it will not be discussed here, but details can be found in [22].

### Pair production \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\Delta_{R}^{--}\to 4\ell\)

Pair production of \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\Delta_{R}^{--}\) is suppressed by the expected high mass of the \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\) but can nevertheless serve to confirm discovery in some region of mass. The diagrams with \(s\)-channel \(Z\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) exchange have been added to the \(\gamma\) exchange diagram in the implementation of the Drell-Yan process in the PYTHIA generator, taking the coupling of \(Z,\ Z^{\prime}\) to fermions and to \(\Delta_{L}^{++}\) from references [23, 5]. For the case of leptonic decays, the process constitutes a golden channel and the background will be negligible. Fig. 7 shows the contours of discovery, defined as observation of 10 events, if all four leptons are detected or if any 3 of the leptons are observed. Being an \(s\)-channel process not involvingthe \(W_{R}\), this channel is not sensitive to the mass of this heavy gauge boson.

### Other channels

Other possible channels have not been considered here. Single production followed by the decay \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\to W_{R}^{+}W_{R}^{+}\) is possible if \(m_{\Delta_{R}^{++}}\) is sufficiently large, but given the lower bound on \(m_{W_{R}}\), this channel is strongly suppressed kinematically. It would be also difficult to reconstruct since the decays \(W_{R}\to\ell N\) would not lead to a mass resonance and would require a knowledge of the mass of \(N\), a heavy right-handed or Majorana neutrino. Pair production \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\Delta_{R}^{-}\) and other such combinations can arise from \(s\)-channel \(W\) exchange

### Dilepton channel

As for the case of the \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\)  the dilepton channel provides a clean signature. Although the Yukawa coupling of \(\Delta_{L}^{++}\) to leptons remains a parameter of the theory, this channel can, in fact, be dominant since the alternative decay to gauge bosons is possibly negligible, being proportional to the very small value of the vev \(v_{L}\). In the limit where \(v_{L}=0\), it will be the only open channel, but production of \(\Delta_{L}^{++}\) will only occur in pair, through \(s\)-channel \(\gamma/Z/Z^{\prime}\) exchange. As before, we will assume below 100% branching ratio to leptons, but results can be reinterpreted in a straightforward way for different values of these branching ratios.

The production cross section of \(\Delta_{L}^{++}\) is proportional to \(v_{L}^{2}\). Table 6 gives the value as a function of mass, for \(v_{L}\) = 9 GeV.

#### 5.1.1 \(\Delta_{L}^{++}\to e^{+}e^{+}/\mu^{+}\mu^{+}\)

The following selection criteria were applied:

1. Two isolated leptons (\(e\) or \(\mu\)) of positive sign must be reconstructed, with \(p_{T}>25\) GeV
2. Since the leptons result from the decay of a heavy, slow particle, they will be collinear. The azimuthal separation between the two leptons is required to satisfy the cut \(\Delta\Phi_{ll}>2.5\) when the reconstructed mass is 300 GeV or more. For lower masses, we choose \(\Delta\Phi_{ll}>1\) (see Fig. 8).
3. The vectorial difference between the transverse momenta of the two leptons (\(\Delta_{P_{T}^{ll}}\))is tuned for each assumed mass of the reconstructed \(\Delta_{L}^{++}\). We require: \(\Delta_{P_{T}^{ll}}>(\frac{M_{ll}}{2}+50)\) for masses 200 GeV or more and \(\Delta_{P_{T}^{ll}}>70\) GeV otherwise (see Fig. 9).
4. Forward jet tagging was applied as in Sect. 4.1.1.
5. The missing energy was required to be less than 40 GeV since, in the SM, a same-sign lepton pair will always be associated with missing energy from accompanying neutrinos. In addition, we reject events where one jet is tagged as a b-jet.

Table 7 gives the number of expected signal and background events for the cases \(m_{\Delta^{++}_{L}}=300\) GeV and \(m_{\Delta^{++}_{L}}=800\) GeV respectively. A mass window of \(\pm 2\times\) the width

of the resonance was selected. An example of a signal over SM background is given in Fig. 10. The discovery reach in the plane \(v_{L}\) vs \(m_{\Delta^{++}_{L}}\) is shown in Fig. 11.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(\Delta^{++}\) & \(\Delta^{++}\) & total backg \\  & 300 GeV & 800 GeV & \\ \hline Isolated leptons & 330 (384) & 59 (69) & 133/13 \\ \hline \(|\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}>2.5\) & 253 (289) & 56 (65) & 75/8.3 \\ \hline \(\Delta_{p_{T}^{ll}}>(\frac{M_{ll}}{2}\)+50) & 220 (260) & 50 (59) & 37/2.5 \\ \hline Fwd Jet tagging & 156(185) & 40 (47) & 17/1.4 \\ \hline ptmiss & 152(180) & 34 (40) & 3.0/0.1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Mass windows \(\pm 2\sigma\) around the resonances have been chosen. In parentheses is shown the number of events without the mass window cut.

#### 5.1.2 \(\Delta^{++}_{L}\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{+}\)

As mentioned above, the Yukawa coupling of \(\Delta^{++}_{L}\) to \(\tau\) leptons may dominate, in which case it will be essential to reconstruct the decay \(\Delta^{++}_{L}\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{+}\). As for the case of \(\Delta^{++}_{L}\) presented above, besides the backgrounds of Table 2, we have also taken into account \(Zjj\).

\(\tau^{+}\tau^{+}\rightarrow\ell^{+}\ell^{+}p_{T}^{miss}\)

The following cuts have been applied to select the di-lepton final states:

1. two same sign leptons with \(P_{T}>\) 25 GeV.
2. Tau reconstruction: \(0<x_{\tau 1}<1\) and \(0<x_{\tau 2}<1\), where \(x_{\tau 1,\tau 2}\) are defined as in Sect. 4.1.2
3. b-jet veto: a b-jet tagging efficiency of 0.6 is applied
4. forward jet tagging, as in Sect. 4.1.1
5. in order to reduce the \(t\bar{t}\) and \(qqWW\) backgrounds an additional cut was applied on the invariant mass of the two leptons: \(M_{ll2}>30GeV\)

Results of the analysis for a \(\Delta^{++}_{L}\)of mass of 300 GeV and 800 GeV are summarized in Table 8. A mass window of \(\pm 2\times\) the width of the reconstructed resonance has been selected. The parameter region where discovery is possible with 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) is shown in Fig. 12.

\(\frac{\tau^{+}\tau^{+}\rightarrow\ell^{+}hp_{T}^{miss}}{}\)

As for the case of \(\Delta_{R}^{++}\) discussed above, this channel is dominated by \(W\) + jets background and will not been shown here. Details can be found in [22].

### \(\Delta_{L}^{++}\to W^{+}W^{+}\)

The decay of \(\Delta_{L}^{++}\) to a pair of \(W\) bosons has been previously analyzed in the context of the little Higgs model [17] and will not be repeated here. It was found that the background from \(qqW^{+}W^{+}\) production process (with transverse \(W\)'s) was significant and that a 1 TeV resonance could be discovered at the LHC in this channel, with an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\), only if \(v_{L}>29\) GeV. This value of \(v_{L}\) is higher than would be reasonably expected from the constraints on the \(\rho\) parameter, as mentioned in the introduction.

### Pair production \(\Delta_{L}^{++}\Delta_{L}^{--}\)

As for the case of the right-handed sector, pair production of \(\Delta_{L}^{++}\) is a possible discovery channel. The diagram with \(s\)-channel \(Z^{\prime}\) exchange has been added to the implementation of this Drell-Yan process in the PYTHIA generator, taking the coupling of \(Z^{\prime}\) to fermions and to \(\Delta_{L}^{++}\) from references [5, 23]. Assuming leptonic decays, the background will be negligible. Fig. 13 shows the contours of discovery, defined as observation of 10 events, if all four leptons are detected or if any 3 of the leptons are observed.

## 6 Summary and Conclusion

Left-Right symmetric models predict the existence of doubly-charged Higgs bosons which should yield a striking signature at the LHC. The principal possible production and decay modes have been investigated and the reach of ATLAS for discovery is summarized in Figs. 4,6,7,11 and 12 in terms of the parameters of the model. These plots are not independent. As the couplings to fermions are not known, the different channels have been considered separately, assuming 100% branching ratio in each case.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(\Delta^{++}\) & \(\Delta^{++}\) & total backg \\  & 300 GeV & 800 GeV & \\ \hline Isolated leptons & 42 (54) & 10.1(13.4) & 707/299 \\ \hline \(0<x_{1},\ x_{2}<1\) & 40 (47) & 9.6 (12.0) & 480/222 \\ \hline no b jet & 38 (46) & 9.1 (11.5) & 158/100 \\ \hline Fwd Jet tagging & 18 (22) & 4.3 (5.8) & 33/23 \\ \hline \(M_{ll}>30\) GeV & 15 (16.3) & 3.8 (4.8) & 23/16 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Mass windows \(\pm 2\sigma\) around the resonances have been chosen. In parentheses is shown the number of events without the mass window cut.

It is found that the LHC will be able to probe a large region of unexplored parameter space.
