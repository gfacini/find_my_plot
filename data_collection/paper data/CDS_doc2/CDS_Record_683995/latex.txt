**Abstract**

Light yield for the different radial layers of tiles inside a cell of the Module 0 was measured using 1998 test beam data. Information on the light production is provided by the source calibration scans and by the response of the calorimeter to muons at 90 degrees entering the different tile centers. The number of photoelectrons per tile size was calculated by two methods, the **splitting method**[1] and by the standard technique [7] of **photoelectron statistics**. The comparison of the results given by the two methods has been done and the study of the stability of the slope (first method), obtained from splitting the cell response spectrum into several slices, has been done either.

The uniformity and the assymmetry were studied using both the information provided by a radioactive cesium source and the 180 GeV muon data. The data obtained from both the \({}^{137}Cs\) and muon subcell measurements present large fluctuation. The cell-to-cell fluctuation measured by \(\mu\) at 90 degrees are 5.7% and 7.1% using respectively the new and old CIS databases. The fluctuation obtained with the new CIS database is similar to that obtained with the \({}^{137}Cs\) radioactive source (5.8%). Instead the dispersion of cells in rows 2, 5, and 10, which were used in the adjustment of the HV, are 1.5% and 0.8% using respectively Tile and Integral values. This result is in agreement with the requisite that the dispersion should be better than 2%.

## Introduction

The barrel Module 0 [2] tested in 1998, was re-equipped in one half (the negative \(\eta\) side) with Bicron fibres, the ones used in sampling A had a 60 ppm of UVA, while the rest of the fibres in this side had not UVA absorber. Instead, the other half of the detector (the positive \(\eta\) side) was equipped with Pol.Hi.Tech fibres.

The detector was positioned in the H8 beam of the CERN SPS accelerator and was mounted on a scanning table, which provided accurate movements in all directions. Five prototype modules, one meter long, built in previous years were placed on either sides of Module 0, three on one side and two in the other, as shown in figure 1. Scintillator walls at the side and back of the calorimeter stack assisted in the identification of muons and shower leakages.

Tilecal barrel Module 0 (BM0) contains 11 different sizes of trapezoidal shaper tiles, ranging from about 200 up to 400 mm lenght in \(\phi\) and from 97 to 187 mm in radial width. Each cell (figure 2) holds several tile sizes depending on the radial depth, the sampling A groups the tiles 1,2 and 3 which are the three smaller ones, the sampling BC groups tiles from 4 to 9 and the sampling D groups tiles 10 and 11. The wavelenght-shifting fibres are placed in contact with the non-parallel edges of the tiles; readout cells are then defined by grouping together a set of fibres into a photomultiplier, each cell is read out by 2 PMTs. Each tile has two holes, 9 mm in diameter, through its surface for the passage of the calibration source tubes.

The Tilecal Module 0 design includes the possibility of running a radioactive source throught every tile; this feature permits to check the response of each scintillator tile. The current induced in the PMT is proportional to the gain of the PMT and to the photoelectron yield of the calorimeter for the scintillation light induced by the source. The use of a movable \(\gamma\) source allows:

* intercalibration of the readout cells by adjusting the HV of the corresponding PMT.
* monitoring in time the average current of each cell.
* checking the quality of the optical response and its uniformity.

A precision of 1% should be reached in monitoring measurements in order to get early detection of any degradation. With respect to the intercalibration of cells, a better precision than 2% is needed, due to the fact that a random 5% in cell miscalibration added quadratically to the constant term of the energy resolution would result in an increasement of 1.5% (for pion) and 1% (for jets) of this term.

## 2. The data sample

For the analysis presented in this note two sets of data have been used:

* Information on the light yield for the different radial layers of tiles inside the cells can be extracted from the response of the detector (BM0) to 180 GeV muons impinging at 90 degrees along the whole path through the calorimeter structure. The results presented here come from runs 43801 to 43815 (one run per tile) taken during the 1998 test beam period.
* Information on the light yield (the Cesium integral values) is provided from the Cesium energy deposited in a cell, which has the contribution of at least two individual tile row responses. In order to extract the response of a particular tile row the fraction of energy deposited in the neighbour tile row has to be taken into account. The source traversed a row of tiles in a cell through a hole situated at 15 mm from the edge, a distance which is of the same order as the range of \({}^{137}Cs\) photons in the calorimeter structure. From previous studies based on Montecarlo together with the radioactive source data taken with previous

of the tiles. The muon data is very useful for this purpose because its energy loss behaviour is close to the one of a mip, in that case the signal is well contained inside a single tile row. As it has been already mentioned, a fraction of the source energy is deposited in the tile row closest to the hole the source is passing through. In order to compare the cesium and muon data one should calculate the _Tile values_ from the _Integral values_ solving a linear system of eleven linear equations [4][5].

**3. Number of photoelectrons.**

The light yield for each cell of the Tilecal Barrel Module 0 was measured using the available data from a detailed scan with a 180 GeV muon beam at 90 degrees, performed in the test beam of July 1998. The number of photoelectrons, \(N_{pe}\), per GeV of deposited energy and per calorimeter cell (sum over the responses of both PMTs reading the same cell) is determined through the equation:

\[N_{pe}=C(\frac{Q_{U+D}}{\sigma_{U-D}})^{2}\frac{1}{Q_{U+D}}\alpha_{e} \tag{2}\]

Where C=1.11 [6] is a correction factor taking into account the photostatistics effects at subsequent dynodes of the photomultipliers. \(Q_{U+D}\) (in pC) is the total energy deposited per cell and the \(\sigma_{U-D}\) is the RMS of the Gaussian distribution of the difference of the two PMTs signal, which arises from photostatistics. The electron beam scale (1 GeV = 0.84 pC) and the factor (electron/muon=0.91 [7]) relating the electron and the muon energy losses are used together to calculate the conversion coefficient between pC and GeV. In this section we report on a study based on the \(\mu\) charge spectrum applying two methods in order to estimate de \(N_{pe}\):

1. In order to minimize the influence of the muon energy loss fluctuations governed by _Landau distribution_[8] (figure 3), the resulting charge spectrum of the two PMTs seeing the same cell was sliced into several intervals [1]. In each interval, the mean energy, \(Q_{U+D}\), and the sigma of the two PMTs signal difference distribution is evaluated. In fact, the dependence of sigma square versus the mean energy may be fitted by a straight line. The number of photoelectrons is the invers value of the slope.
2. To estimate the muon energy loss in each cell for each tile size, the resulting charge distribution was fitted by the Landau and Gaussian convolution (this function describes the muon signal distribution better than the Moyal function) and the Most Probable value was taken from the fit (\(Q_{U+D}\)). The sigma square (\(\sigma_{U-D}\)) of the signal difference in the two PMTs reading out the same cell was obtained by a Gaussian fit to the data. The number of photoelectrons per GeV per cell was calculated by the equation (2).

The number of photoelectrons obtained by the first method is illustrated in figure 4, where the plot presents the \(N_{pe}\) per GeV versus the Tile number. Each data point is the average of the \(N_{pe}\) calculated for each cell whithin the same sampling. The spread associated to each point is mainly caused by cell to cell fluctuations within the corresponding sampling. Also, the results obtained applying the second method to the different tile sizes at different depths are shown in the figure 5. The meaning of this second plot is the same as the one explained above.

**3.1 Comparison between both methods.**

For each tile of samplings A, BC and D, the number of photoelectrons per cell of the negative \(\eta\) side of BM0, calculated by the splitting method has been compared with the \(N_{pe}\) estimated by the second method. The table 1 shows the results obtained for this comparison. The difference in the \(N_{pe}\) between the sampling A and the other samplings (BC, D) could be explained by the large attenuation length in the fibres doped with UV absorber. However, as it can be seen in this table, the first method gives higher numbers than the photoelectron statistics method, but with wider spread of the results, mostly in the samplings BC and D. This can be mainly caused by the few number of events in the population of the slices.

Table 1: _Determination and Comparison of \(N_{pe}\)._

**3.2 Study of the photoelectron yield stability.**

In order to study the stability of the slope evaluated from the charge cell spectrum, after removing both tails at low (about 8% of the spectrum) and at high (about 15% of the distribution) energy, the data were divided into several energy slices with equal width of energy intervals \(\Delta E_{i}\) (figure 6). Figure 7 illustrates the results of this study for cell D2 (muons hitting the center of the tile #10) of the BM0. This figure shows the plots of the straight line fits of \(<E_{i}>\) versus \(\sigma_{U-D}\). The evaluation of the \(N_{pe}\) as a function of the number of intervals selected on the charge spectrum could be seen in figure 8, each point is associated with its errors calculated from the fit in figure 7. The parameter is stable, however, the small number of events in each interval gives large errors.

On the other hand, to evaluate the effect of the cut performed on tails, the slope was calculated for different cut values in the splitting method. The used values were chosen in such a way that 60%, 70%, 80% and 90% of events remained after rejecting the tails. Table 2 contains the results obtained from this study. The slope is not sensitive to the location of the cut on the charge spectrum.

## 4. Check of the module calibration with \(\mu\) beams

As it has been mentioned, the assymmetry in the response of both cell phototubes could have strong effects in the _energy estimation_ and _energy resolution._ So, in order to cross-check that the Module has been correctly calibrated with the Cs137 source, 180 GeV \(\mu\) hitting perpendicularly to the tile surfaces (runs 43801-43815) have been analysed. The estimate S (S=(U-D)/(U+D)) allows us to study the difference in the signal measured by the two PMTs (Up and Down) connected to a same cell (figure 9). This figure (left) shows the estimate of the assymmetry for all cells of the negative \(\eta\) side. The distribution has a large RMS of the order of 4% corresponding \(\frac{4}{\sqrt{2}}=2.8\%\) to each PMT, this result is worst than the one obtained from the BM0 intercalibration (with the Cs137 source), which was 1%.

### 4.1 \({}^{137}Cs\) assymmetry compared with \(\mu\).

In order to compare the Cesium and Muons at 90 degrees one needs to extract the individual tile row (_Tile value_) Cesium response from the Cesium _Integral value_, solving a linear system of eleven equations [4][5], since the \({}^{137}Cs\) source deposites energy not only across the current tile row, but in the next one as well. A first indication that the assymmetries for \({}^{137}Cs\) and \(\mu\) agree can be seen in figure 10, except for A-4, B-6, BC-2 and D-1, which show large differences. Taking into account that the Cesium and the \(\mu\) data are readout by different class of electronics, while the physical signals were readout by Fast Pulse electronics the \({}^{137}Cs\) source data was taken using Low Current Integrators. The differences between some cells can indicate a possible CIS miscalibration. The muon data has been corrected (figure 9 right) by the new set of CIS coefficients [4][9] and the results obtained are shown in figure 11, the improvement in the correlation between both assymmetries may be noticed.

## 5 Calibration and light yield uniformity.

As mentioned above the aim of the gain setting procedure is to adjust the HV of each PMT reading the detector, in order to obtain a uniform response from the readout cells within a dispersion better than 2%. Data obtained (run 20167) from the movable source system allows us to check the level of uniformity for different

On the other hand, to compare cells of different widths, the Integral value or the Tile value of the response curve of each cell was normalized to the width of the cell (18 mm x the number of tiles in the cell) [3]. The distribution of the unfolded individual tile row responses for all cells in the negative \(\eta\) of the Module is shown in figure 12, where one can see in the bottom plots that the response obtained from tile rows 2, 5, and 10 were used for the gain setting due to the fact that they had a dispersion less than 2% (for both kinds of data: Integral value and Tile value) while the distribution (top plots) corresponding to all individual tile responses of all cells has a large dispersion of about 4.9% (Tile value) and 5.8% (Integral value) due to the tile to tile fluctuations, tile-fibre coupling, fibre to fibre fluctuations, fluctuations inside a cell originated by the fact that more than one tile is readout by the same fibre.

Moreover, the 180 GeV muon data at 90 degrees provides an alternative technique to intercalibrate the calorimeter cells, so, other attempts were also made to check the quality of the optical response and its uniformity. To estimate the energy loss by muons in each cell for each tile size, the light signal corresponding to the total energy deposited in the cell (figure 3) is fitted by a Landau convoluted with a Gaussian function [8] in order to obtain the most probable value from this fit. The muon response in each cell was also normalized to the size of the cell for doing the comparison between all cells. In figure 13 the results obtained for this study from the muon data with corrections (new set of CIS coefficients) and without are given, where the histogram of the unfolded individual tile row responses of all cells (new CIS database) agree with the results provided by the Cesium response, but the large dispersion, depicted on the lower part of figure, of the order of 7.1% indicated a CIS miscalibration.

The assymmetry for all cells (negative \(\eta\)), calculated by \(\mu\) data, is also improved after the correction of the data (figure 9 right). The rms is now 3.1%. So the intercalibration of individual PMT is now within a dispersion of 2.2% (new CIS coefficients).

**5.1 Uniformity of cells at negative \(\eta\) side.**

The routing design (figure 2) was selected in order to minimize the fluctuations on the light yield inside a cell and between cells (small discrepancies between cells can be corrected adjusting the gain of the different PMTs). Then, in order to check the uniformity on the light output of the barrel Module 0 for each tile row, the average of the different cell responses was evaluated, for both CIS coefficients. The results are depicted in figure 14, where a similar profile is seen with \({}^{137}Cs\) and with muons, which are in good agreement. In this figure one can see the average tile row response as a function of the tile number, the spread associated to each point is mainly caused by cell to cell fluctuations within the corresponding tile row. The points are normalized to the value of tiles 2 (sampling A), 5 (sampling BC) and 10 (sampling D), which were used to intercalibrate the BM0. The non uniformity illustrated in the plots (14), between the two subsamples of sampling BC, can arise from the different fibre lenghts and tile sizes in each cell.

## Conclusions.

The average values of the number of photoelectrons, \(N_{pe}\), per GeV and per cell were calculated by two methods, using in both the data provided by the 180 GeV \(\mu\) beams entering the different tile centres at 90 degrees (Negative \(\eta\) side). For the three samplings A, BC and D the values are 31, 38 and 39 respectively, from the photoelectron method, and 33, 43 and 49, from the splitting method. The second method gives a large \(N_{pe}\) than the first one and bigger fluctuations since this method consists in splitting the charge spectrum distribution into several intervals, with the corresponding decrease of statistics.

The assymmetry, S, was used as an estimator to evalute the discrepancies between the two PMTs reading the same cell. Then a comparison of the assymmetry was done, using the \(\mu\) at 90 degrees (1998 test beam, negative \(\eta\)) and the \({}^{137}Cs\) data. After applying the new set of CIS coefficients the two above mentioned sources of information show a good agreement and the rms of the distribution of the assymmetry (\(\mu\) data, all cells of Negative \(\eta\)) is 3.1%.

A large dispersion, 7%, is observed between cells inside a row using 180 GeV \(\mu\) beam. This dispersion founds its origin in the miscalibration. To optimize this value the \(\mu\) data have been corrected by a new CIS database and the obtained results were compatible with the dispersion, 5%, calculated from the \({}^{137}Cs\) data, taking into account that the cesium and the \(\mu\) data were readout by different type of electronics. The calibration performance is very satisfactory for the ATLAS requirements. So, cell intercalibration of the order of 1% was achieved for tile rows 2, 5 and 10 (0.8%, Integral value, 1.5%, Tile value).
