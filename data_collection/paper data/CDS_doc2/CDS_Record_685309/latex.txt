Introduction

The University of Michigan ATLAS group has taken responsibility for construction of 31000 precision long drift tubes, and the assembly of these tubes into 80 _Monitored Drift Tube_ (MDT) chambers for the endcap of the ATLAS muon system. These chambers are part of the ATLAS muon spectrometer and provide a precision measurement of muon sagitta in the ATLAS endcap toroid magnet. The design tracking resolution is 80 \(\mu\)m, necessitating a 25 \(\mu\)m building precision in the chamber construction. Michigan is building five different types of chambers for the "EM" layer mounted on the _Big Wheel_ of the ATLAS endcap muon spectrometer. Michigan is making 16 each of chambers EMS5, EMS4, EML3, EML4, and EML5. Our chamber mass production started in Oct. 2000. In the first year of mass production (up to Nov. 2001) we have completed 30 precision MDT chambers (16 EMS5 chambers, and 14 EMS4 chambers). The production speed has exceeded our original expected speed by 15%. This paper will focus on our chamber production techniques and mass production experience. The precision tube production techniques and mass production experience will be reported in a separate paper.

Chambers consist of 6 MDT drift tube layers with 64 tubes per layer. The 6 layers are divided into two 3-tube multi-layers (ML) which are glued on either side of a spacer frame. The chambers are 2 m wide by 0.35 m high, and with lengths from 3 - 6 m. The endcap chambers are built in a stepped trapezoid shape with 8 tubes per step. The chambers come in two general varieties: _Long_ with a corner angle of 76\({}^{o}\) (example: EML) and _Short_ with a corner angle of 81.5\({}^{o}\) (example: EMS). The spacer frame consists of 2 long beams and 3 cross beams. This frame provides structural support for the tubes, as well as locations for 3 attachment points which are used to connect a chamber to the ATLAS support structure. Within the spacer frame are mounted 4 sets RASNIK [1] optical alignment monitoring devices. These devices use a CCD to view a coded mask through a lens to monitor chamber deformations with a precision of 1 \(\mu\)m. On top of the chamber, 4 addition RASNIK cameras are mounted to view sensors on adjacent chambers and support structures to provide global alignment monitoring. At the ends of the chambers are 4 gas manifolds (2 on each ML), electronics for HV fan-in and signal readout. Environment monitoring is done with 20 temperature sensors and 4 magnetic field sensors distributed on both sides of the chamber. A typical endcap MDT chamber mechanical structure is shown in Figure 1.

The following sections describe the general method of the end-cap chamber assembly and the facilities constructed at Michigan for MDT chamber production. We describe the assembly jigging set up, alignment procedures, as well as chamber quality assurance monitoring procedures and data. The chamber service assembly facilities, test procedures, and data are also reported.

## 2 Chamber Assembly Method

The chamber assembly method used in the US MDT production sites was developed by Hermann Wellenstein of Brandeis University. The extreme mechanical precision (25 \(\mu\)m) demanded by the ATLAS muon detector requires great efforts in building very stable and precision facilities and tooling to construct the muon chambers. This high mechanical precision is achieved by using very precise tooling on a very stable and precise surface (granite) in a temperature and humidity-controlled environment.

Our chamber assembly room has been constructed out of part of a high bay room in the physics building. The gluing is done on a granite table which has been ground to an overall flatness of 20 \(\mu\)m. An HVAC system controls the room temperature to \(20^{\circ}\pm 0.5^{\circ}\) and a relative humidity of 45%. The room is equipped with a radio-controlled crane for picking up the chamber.

The chambers are built by first placing tubes on _combs_ which are aluminum beams with v-groves to position the tubes. The base combs were constructed at Michigan and the University of Washington. The final precision v-groves were glued on the comb bases at Brandeis. The combs position the tubes to a few microns accuracy and hold tubes via vacuum suction cups. The combs must be carefully aligned vertically and horizontally. Horizontal alignment is done and adjusting height with shims. Vertical alignment is check by micrometer measurements from the granite, and with the _BCAL_, a laser surveying device developed at Brandeis. Horizontal alignment is done by aligning combs to a stretched wire viewed by a microscope mounted in the combs, and with the

Figure 1: Endcap MDT chamber. An 8 layer chamber is shown. Michigan is building 6 layer chambers.

_BCAL._ This alignment is done only once per chamber type, though periodic measurements are done during construction to check alignment. The combs are positioned precisely and then clamped in place with fixture called _H-blocks_.

After tubes are positioned on the combs, tubes are glued together with epoxy delivered by a glue machine. The glue machine pumps premixed epoxy into nozzles which place blue beads precisely on the tubes. The glue machine sits on a gantry straddling the table and rides on rails at the table edges, giving the glue machine mobility over the entire tube layer. A computer controls the gluing process which layer takes about 25 minutes for a tube layer. The Michigan glue machine has been adapted from the design from the Max Planck Institute in Munich.

Figure 2 shows the granite table with the precision chamber jigging mounted (combs and sphere block towers) and the glue machine.

Once the glue on a tube layer has cured (overnight) it is picked up with the _stiffback_, a stiff frame with vacuum chucks to lift the tube layer. The top layer of tubes in a multilayer has aluminum strips glued to it which engage the vacuum chucks on the bottom of the stiffback.

After the glued tube layer is lifted out of the way, a new tube layer is then laid on the combs and glued to the preceding tube layer. The upper tube layer is held by the stiffback and positioned by lowering the stiffback onto _sphere block towers_ which provide precise lateral and horizontal displacements between layers. Different height sphere block towers provide displacements for different tube layers.

Two multilayers of three tube layers are constructed per chamber. The final

step in construction is the gluing of a _spacer frame_ between the two multilayers.

Figure 3 shows the gluing of the spacer frame to the two multilayers, illustrating the main features of the chamber jigging.

After chamber gluing, the chamber gas system and electronics must be installed which is done outside the chamber assembly room.

## 3 UM chamber assembly facilities

In this section we describe the Michigan production facilities in more detail.

* **Assembly room:** A temperature and humidity controlled chamber assembly room has been constructed in the high bay area in the Physics Department at the University of Michigan. The size of the room is \(9.2\times 7.6\times 4.5\)m\({}^{3}\). The room temperature is controlled to \(20^{\circ}\pm 0.5^{\circ}\), and relative humidity to \(45\pm 5\%\).
* **Granite surface plate:** Our granite has dimensions of \(6.45\times 2.9\times 0.41\) m\({}^{3}\) weighs 25,000 kg with a surface flatness of 20 \(\mu\)m.
* **Overhead cranes:** Two cranes are used in our construction project. The crane in the chamber assembly room is a Coffing 1 ton wire rope monorail hoist. It has a

variable lifting speed ranging from 1 foot/min to 12 feet/min., and its trolley speed is 18 feet/min. The control is provided by a Telemite Radio Control Receiver and Telemotive Transmitter. Another crane is installed in our chamber crating room (the Truck Bay), it is a Coffing 2 ton wire rope mono-rail hoist (model WRMT4014-4-22). It has two lifting speeds, 14 feet/min. and 4.7 feet/min. The trolley is motor driven at 18 feet/min. The control is via a pendant with four pushbuttons.
* **Vacuum systems:** Two vacuum pumps (Busch model OTMS-1-RC0025 Simplex Central Vacuum System) are installed on top of the assembly room. Each pump is capable of a displacement of 20 CFM and is powered by a 1.5 hp electric motor. Each pump has an 370 ft\({}^{3}\) reservoir which allows the vacuum to remain better than 60% of full vacuum for at least 40 hours in the case of a pump failure. One pump supplies the stiffback to pick up tube layers in the chamber assembly process, and the other supplies the comb vacuum. The vacuum piping to the granite table is 2" I.D. The two vacuum pumps are joined by a 2" valve to permit one pump to supply both systems in case one pump has problems. Normally the pumps are set to _automatic_ operation mode where the vacuum will be kept between 70-95% of full vacuum.
* **Precision combs:** A set of precision jigs (V-shaped combs) made of Aluminum are mounted and aligned on the granite table to hold a layer of 64 tubes using vacuum suction cups. Nine straight combs, two 8.5\({}^{o}\)-combs, and two 14\({}^{o}\)-combs are needed for UM chamber assembly. These combs are designed and constructed to set the wire pitch (30.036 mm) to a 5\(\mu\)m accuracy, and to control the tube layer planarity (by uniform comb heights) to a 10 \(\mu\)m accuracy.
* **H-blocks:** The comb holding blocks (H-blocks) are clamped on the granite table to be used at each end of the comb to hold the comb positions, as well as to fine tune the comb positions when aligning the combs on the granite table.
* **Sphere blocks:** There are 10 sets of precision "sphere blocks", each set has four different level of towers. They will be used to set the relative heights and offsets of tube layers during gluing to an accuracy of better than 20 microns. The sphere blocks and towers permit a precise and reproducible positioning of tube layers.
* **Stiffback:** We use a special rigid frame called a "stiffback" which consists of 5 cross panels hanging from a 7.6 m long I-beam connected to the overhead crane to pick up tube multi-layers during construction. The shape of the stiffback is similar to the chamber spacer frame, except that it has larger dimension in height (35 cm), thus much stiffer. The bottoms of the 5 stiffback panels are precision vacuum chucks to pick up tube layers via aluminum strips which have been glued on the top tube layer. A different size stiffback will be used for each chamber size. On the long side of the stiffback corner panel bottoms, two cups sit on the spheres on the sphere blocks during the gluing of two layers. One corner will set the chamber 'origin', which has no freedom for moving, another one will set the 'axis' of the chamber, which can only slide along the chamber length direction. The rest eight bottom ends of the panels are connected V-shape structure, which can move freely horizontally when lower down the stiffback to attach the sphere blocks in the gluing process.
* **Glue machine and control system:** A large automatic gluing machine with 3D motion has be constructed to glue the tubes together. After thorough investigation, we have designed a large, but economical motion system and determined the alignment and mounting method. The motion rails have been mounted on the granite table (with only one side motor driving). The glue dispenser system was designed by the Max Planck Institute in Munich, Germany. Considering our large chamber size and glue life time limit, we implemented two glue heads (each has three beads) in our glue machine so that we can apply glue to two tubes simultaneously. For an EMS5 chamber (average length 3.4 m), gluing one tube layer takes 25 minutes. The glue control electronics circuit was built at Michigan, which has total 25 signals to be controlled for the machine gantry motions and the glue plunger and valve motions. All the signals are controlled by an online computer program using LabWindows software from National Instruments.
* **Glue pre-mixing and feeding station :** The epoxy is pre-mixed and filled into cylinders in our glue mixing station. This station consists of three pneumatic guns mounted on a mobile table. The standard glue mixing tube connecting to the un-mixing glue cartridges will be mounted on the pneumatic guns when feeding the mixed glue into the cylinders, which has diameter of 3.65 cm and length of 15.25cm. The pneumatic guns are connected to our wall compressed air outlets with 75 PSI. It takes 3 minutes to feed three cylinders using 'back feeding' method to avoid air bubbles. Total 6 cylinders of pre-mixed glue will be mounted on the glue heads right after the feeding.
* **The BCAL system:** The BCAL consists of a controllable laser viewed by a CCD camera which is used for precision surveying of combs or granite table. The camera views a laser spot and determines the centroid (accurate to \(\approx 1\mu\)m of the image and is mounted on special fixtures for use on combs or granite table. The camera is readout with VME modules developed by Brandeis. This system is used to measure the flatness of the granite table, to align the combs on the table, as well as to measure the comb height profile.
* **Wire / microscope alignment system:** This system is for comb alignment measurement. It consists of four wire hold fixtures (two of them can adjust the wire positions), one microscope mounted on a rigid fixture sitting on the notches of the combs. Two 50 micron wires are mounted on the granite table, and set to be parallel to the glue rails to \(\pm 50\mu\)m, and on the top of the comb notches. The wire positions can be viewed using the microscope manually or by a CCD camera with image shown on the computer with a few microns precision.
* **The RASNIK system:** The RASNIK system is an optical system which uses a CCD to view a coded mask through a lens to monitor the targeted positions. This system also includes associated readout electronics and computer interface card. Sophisticated software based on VME module readout is used. We have used such systems to monitor deformations of the chamber, the deformations of the stiffback, and the tube layer relative positions during the chamber assembly.
* **The OPS system:** The Optical Position System (OPS) is used to monitor the position of each tube layer during the gluing process via optical sensors on the stiffback. On each corner of the stiffback are 2 _RASNIK_ systems masks which are viewed by CCD cameras on the granite table. Thus we monitor the position of the stiffback as we glue each layer to ensure that the jigging has been set up correctly.
* **Online computers and monitor sensors:** Two PC stations are located inside the chamber assembly room. One is equipped with two DAQ cards to control the gluing process and to monitor the room temperature, humidity, and the vacuum. It is used also for database recording. Another PC is dedicated for optical monitoring systems. A VME crate with all the optical system readout modules are controlled by this computer. Eight temperature sensors are distributed on the granite table attached to the combs. Six vacuum sensors are used to monitor the stiffback and the comb vacuum levels during the assembly. One humidity sensor is used to monitor the room humidity.
* **Spacer assembly table:** This table is used to assemble spacer frames. It consists of two machined aluminum stands which have the same size \(5\times 2.5\)m\({}^{2}\), and adjustable leg height. The two stands are set end by end and adjusted to match the spacer length for different type of chambers. Three 3/4" thick aluminum jig plates are placed on the top of the stands. The middle plate is 8 feet\({}^{2}\) and joins the two stands together. The two side plates have size of \(2\times 8\) feet\({}^{2}\) and are movable to match the spacer size and shape. We used a laser pointer and a straight edge to align and shim the three plates to the same level, with a overall flatness of 100 microns. The spacer assembly table is located in the high bay, outside of the chamber assembly room.
* **Two large rolling tables:** These home-built large rolling tables are expandable in length, lightweight, and rigid. One table is located inside the chamber assembly room to store the 400 tubes for one chamber's gluing, and the first glued multi-layer in a chamber. The table is also used to transport a completed chamber out of the assembly room via the large double door of the chamber room. Another rolling table in high bay outside of assembly room and is equipped with gas test devices. This table is used for installation and testing of the chamber gas system, as well as to install and test the chamber electronics.

The critical parameters of quality control specifications for chamber assembly are listed in Table 1.

## 4 UM precision jigging setup measurement and monitoring

We take great pains to set up and monitor the jigging on the granite. We strive to take redundant independent measurements whenever possible to remove systematic errors. For example, to align the combs we use both a wire-microscope method (align to a stretched wire viewed with a microscope), and BCAL (align to laser viewed by CCD). In addition, we monitored the positions of the combs periodically throughout production with the BCAL. Figure 4 shows a series of BCAL measurements made during EMS5 chamber construction demonstrating the accuracy and stability of the combs during this period. The combs were positioned to and accuracy of 8 \(\mu\)m RMS for EMS5 construction.

Figure 5 shows plots of BCAL and wire microscope measurements of the lateral alignment of EMS4 combs. Note the excellent agreement between the

\end{table}

## 5 UM chamber construction monitoring data

As mentioned previously, the chamber precision is monitored during construction with the OPS and stiffback RASNIK systems, which measure the positions of the tube layers as they are glued. OPS data from EMS4 are shown in Figure 6 below. The data show the absolute position of the stiffback relative to reference values taken during jigging setup. The OPS values repeat absolutely for all chamber levels, as this plot demonstrates.

The stiffback RASNIK system is a 3 point measuring system with a RASNIK mask at one end of the stiffback, a lens in the middle, and a CCD at the other end. The movement of any one of these components will cause the RASNIK position to change. The layer 1 measurements are used as a baseline and

These measurements were made in notch 15 on the 9 combs used in the EMS5 set up. The comb position is the position of the comb on the granite in chamber center coordinates.

layers 2,3, and spacer framer are compared to it to see if the stiffback shows any distortion. Figure 7 shows all stiffback measurements from all chambers produced. This plot demonstrates the stability of the stiffback. Note that the stiffback is made to be somewhat flexible so that it can conform to the first tube layer. Once a tube layer is glued and pickup with the stiffback, the stiffback becomes very stiff. Hence, we do not expect absolute reproducibility with the stiffback RASNIK system as we do for the OPS.

## 6 UM MDT Mass Production Experience

In the past year Michigan has moved from the ATLAS muon detector R&D and preparation phase to mass production of the MDT chambers. The major achievements in the past year are summarized below.

* After the construction of a very successful full-sized prototype chamber (Module 0 in June, 2000), we further enhanced our production facilities, adding the optical monitoring systems for chamber production and chamber global alignment. These new facilities helped us significantly speed up our production rate and improved our our high quality standards.
* May 2000). After finishing the first chamber series (EMS5) in early June, 2001, we rebuilt our tube assembly line and test stations, and chamber production facilities for the second chamber series (EMS4), which took 5 weeks. The accuracy of the tooling and setup has reached a level of 10 microns.
* We built 12,000 precision drift tubes, and assembled these tubes into 30 MDT chambers with total seven FTEs. The chamber production rate is

Figure 5: Plots of BCAL (Laser) and wire microscope measurements for the EMS4 lateral positions. The two sets of measurements track each other to within a few microns.

15% higher than we originally planned for the first year of production (with three operators). * We have had 2 chambers measured in the x-ray tomography facility at CERN, and both met the 20 \(\mu\)m RMS precision requirement on wire positions. * A cosmic ray test station has be built, and an MDT chamber is under active test with all the electronics and readout systems. * We have designed and constructed chamber shipping and storage crates. These have been used to ship all 16 EMS5 chambers to CERN via sea-born container transport. All crates have arrived with no visible damage. We have opened 10 of the 25 crates to check for broken drift-tube wires (each

chamber has 384 tubes). So far, no wires have been broken in transit or in storage.

Figure 8 shows the Michigan tube and chamber production rates over the past year. As the chart shows, after an initial ramp up period, our production rates stabilized to 200-250 tubes per week and 2-3 chambers per month.

## 7 End-Cap Chamber Gas System Overview

After the base chamber is assembled, there are still considerable work to be done in the MDT chamber construction. The most challenging work is to install the chamber gas system and to perform the chamber leak test. In the following sections we describe the gas system and the assembly facilities constructed at

Figure 7: Data from the stiffback RASNIK system. The scatter plot are the horizontal and vertical measurements of the stiffback RASNIK system for all tubes layers compared to level 1.

Michigan.

The MDT on-chamber gas system is comprised of 2 primary components: a glued multilayer (consisting of either 3 or 4 layers of drift tubes epoxied into a matrix) and a pair of manifolds that provide parallel gas feed to individual tubes. The manifolds consist of _gasbars_ ( gas distribution reservoirs) mounted transverse to and along the ends of the rows of tubes in a multilayer. Small brass capillary tubes _tubelets_ convey the gas from the gasbars into the drift tube endplugs.

The chambers are operated by flowing a gas mixture of Ar (93%) and CO\({}_{2}\) (7%) at 3 bar pressure, in parallel through each drift tube at nominal rate of 1 volume exchange per day. This corresponds for a 3 to 4 m wide chamber to a flow rate of order 2 cc/minute. By comparison, the leak rate specification for an N-tube MDT chamber is \(2\mathrm{N}\times 10^{-5}\mathrm{std}-\mathrm{cc}-\mathrm{sec}^{-1}\)

Figure 8: Tube and chamber production rates. Production was slower at first as we debugged our system. Production stopped in June, 2001 to change tooling from the EMS5 chamber type to the EMS4 chamber type.

The leak rate specification is very exacting. In a typical multilayer there are of order 4000 gas system parts including nearly 2000 o-rings. A failure of any one of them may cause a chamber to leak above specifications. The task of rendering a chamber gas tight depends upon the attention and care invested into tubelet assembly, gas bar assembly and gasbar to chamber mounting. Great effort is taken during assembly to minimize potential leaks. The gas sealing surfaces must be kept scrupulously clean, and the gas system pieces should be stored and assembled in clean-room conditions.

## 8 Gas System Components

### Drift Tubes

The drift tubes, while integral to the gas system, are leak tested independently during the fabrication process. This test establishes the integrity of the tube body, the swaged O-ring coupling of the high voltage endplug and tube body and the outward surface of the endplug. Tubes selected to be glued into chambers have been already certified to leak at a rate less than \(<10^{-5}\) bar cc sec\({}^{-1}\).

### Gasbars

Gasbars are the foundation of the distribution manifold from which each tubelet conducts gas to the tubes. They are fabricated from extruded aluminum and machined on CNC mills. After machining their ends are sealed with a welded ALU-minimum insert, they are steam cleaned and pressure tested to 50 PSIG. For a typical chamber a gasbar has 192 pairs of counter bored holes drilled along its top edge. The smaller of the holes (2mm diameter) is bored through into the gasbar inner volume. A tubelet with an O-ring snug around its shaft nests in concentric, counter-bored 4 mm hole provides.

### O-rings

The O-rings used in the gas system are made of EPDM (EP70) or Viton rubber. They are peroxide cured and should conform to technical specifications of durability, lifetime, radiation resistance, UV exposure, and gas permeability[2]. Eight O-rings of four different sizes are needed to interface each drift tube to the manifold.

### Tubelet - Half-Jumper Assemblies

A half jumper assembly consists of a specially shaped capillary tubelet, two O-rings, a plastic snap ring and a Delrin gas connector9. There are four different types of tubelets, or capillary tubes. They are fabricated from 10-20 cm sectionsof drawn brass tubing and are bent to follow an unobstructed path around the signal caps from the gas bar port to the endplug. The inner diameters of longer tubelets are designed to be slightly enlarged relative to shorter ones in order to equalize the gas flow impedance. On to each raw tubelet is fitted a plastic ferrule, an o-ring and an injection molded Delrin"half-jumper" which makes the gas connection, with appropriate o-rings, to the tube endplug. An exploded view of the capillary tube assembly is shown in Figure 9.

## 9 Tubelet Installation on Gasbars

Depending on the particular expediencies of each fabrication site, tubelets are either mounted on the gasbars, _in situ_, with the gas bar mounted first on the chamber, or with the gasbar placed in chamber-end mockup jig. The jig provides a facsimile of the end of a single multilayer. The use of such a jig permits "offline" production and leak testing of the gas manifolds; that is, their production is in parallel with the chamber production sequence.

The gasbar uses a standard 2-004 size O-ring as a gas seal and an electrically conductive injection molded clip and ring system to center the capillary tube in the manifold, secure it mechanically, and make an electrical connection to the (grounded) chamber.

Once all the capillary tubes have been installed, plumbing is attached to the manifold bar that will ultimately connect to the ATLAS gas supply. For this purpose Noryl adapter blocks are bolted to each end of the spacer frame.

Figure 9: Exploded view of the on-chamber gas system

The Noryl blocks are non-conductive in order to reduce ground loop currents.

## 10 Chamber Leak Testing

Due to the generally large dimensions and volumes of most endcap chambers (3-6 m and several hundred liters, respectively), meeting the leak tightness specification requires significant effort and time.

For a typical intermediate size chamber with an average tube volume of 2.4 _lt_, the leak specification corresponds to a pressure drop in one day of:

\[\frac{\mathrm{dp}}{\mathrm{dt}}=\frac{2}{2.4\ 1}\times 10^{-8}\,\frac{\mathrm{ bar\ 1}}{\mathrm{sec}}\times 86400\ \mathrm{sec}=0.72\ \frac{\mathrm{ mbar}}{\mathrm{day}}\]

For a volume at 3 bar this pressure drop is masked by a temperature shift of

\[\delta T\sim 295K\times\frac{0.0007}{3}\sim 70mK\]

In order to produce a gas tight chamber, it must be pressurized, monitored for pressure drops and scanned with gas detectors in order to identify and locate leaks. This is accomplished with an iterative leak checking procedure that employs increasingly sensitive detection techniques, down to \(10^{-4}\)to\(10^{-6}\)csec\({}^{-1}\). For the lower end of this range a Helium mass spectrometer is essential while for the higher end less costly thermal microcavity sniffers are used. These devices are able differentiate a leaking test gas from the ambient air. The maximum sensitivity is about \(10^{-5}\) std cc/sec for Helium and \(10^{-5}\) std cc/sec for Argon or CO\({}_{2}\)

### Gas Tightness Certification: Measurement of chamber dP/dt

After a leak checking procedure is completed, the overall leak rate chamber must be certified to be within ATLAS specifications. This measurement is facilitated by placing the pressurized chamber in a temperature stabilized environment, by carefully monitoring the temperature drifts through the time that that the pressure is being recorded or by using a differential technique in which a reference volume is thermally coupled to the chamber. The leak test can be expedited by using Helium gas rather than chamber gas which is mostly Argon. The leak rate for 2 bar overpressure of Helium is about a factor of two higher than for chamber gas, mostly Argon.

The leak rate measurement test adopted combines elements of all three of the above methods. Each multilayer is tested independently. The pressures are monitored over an extended period (\(\sim\) 1-2 days) depending on chamber size, using absolute[3] and differential[4] transducers for redundancy. The chamber is isolated in thermally stable environment where the temperature variation over one day are on order 1K. The temperature is recorded at several points on each multilayer by an array of thermistors read out by a 16 bit ADC. This array provides a measurement of the relative change in average chamber temperature to 20 mK accuracy. An example of the temperature induced pressure fluctuations is shown in Figure 10, bottom.

The differential measurement relies on the use of 10 l aluminum reference volumes that are thermally coupled to the multilayer under test. This coupling serves to minimize temperature drifts in the environment, although relative drifts between the reference volume and chamber must be still be monitored and corrected.

An example of a pressure measurement is shown in Figure 10 which shows the raw absolute pressure and the pressure after temperature compensation.

Figure 10: Top: Absolute pressure for Argon dominated gas (39 psi Argon, 5 psi Helium. Red, after temperature compensation. Black, raw pressure. Bottom: Temperature drifts within a thermal box enclosing the chamber. The large excursion at 300 hours corresponds to the moving the chamber into another room.

### Results of Multiple Chamber Tests

The chamber leak certification test are performed in the High Bay area, where the temperature is not well controlled. During the test period, we record both differential and absolute pressure with accuracy of 3 mbar and the chamber temperature with accuracy of 0.1\({}^{\circ}\) C in every 10 seconds. Figure 11 shows a typical chamber leak certification data on an EMS4 chamber: (a) the differential pressure (between reference chamber and the test chamber) as a function of time; (b) the absolute pressure of the test chamber as a function of time; (c) the chamber temperature as a function of time. The two arrows in the figure (c) indicate the same temperature at different time, corresponding this time period, we can find the absolute pressure drop indicated in figure (b), so that we can determine the chamber leak rate: \(dp/dt\) without worry about the temperature fluctuation. The chamber leak rate using this method is well consistent with the results obtained using the differential pressure measurement method as indicated in the figure (a) and (b).

Figure 11: Chamber certification data recording in High Bay area. (a) the differential pressure vs. time; (b) the absolute pressure vs. time (c) the temperature vs. time. At the same temperature points, the chamber leak rate using differential and absolute pressure measurements are consistent.

A more simple and effective way to certify a chamber is put the chamber in a temperature controlled room. Figure 12 shows the measurement data: (a) chamber absolute pressure as a function of time; (b) chamber temperature as a function of time. The pressure drop can be directly read from the slope of the pressure data. It also implied that the chamber certification time could be shorter.

Figure 13 shows all of the EMS4 chamber certification test results: all the chambers are satisfy the ATLAS MDT leak specification.

## 11 Summary of the Chamber Gas system Installation and Testing

The gas system components outlined above can be assembled, installed on a chamber and leak debugged and certified by 2 workers on a time scale of 7-9 days, compatible with the chamber assembly schedule

Rendering a large gas volume leak tight, while far from trivial, is possible providing that great care is taken to use only high quality and clean materials and prefabricated parts. In particular the selection of O-rings must be made to ensure proper compression and that no debris interferes with their sealing

## 12 Large Chamber Handling Cart Design and Construction

Chambers are transported between production rooms on carts, which consist of a steel cradle (black) that supports a steel frame (gray) in which the chambers are mounted. The frame, which can be easily separated from the cradle, connects to the chamber via 3/4" pins that engage the chambers kinematic mounts (KM). Both frame and cradle are made of welded steel rectangular tubing. The frame is made of lightweight ladder construction on the sides with rigid ends. The frame has 2" diameter stub axles in the middle of each end, which allow for balanced rotation of the frame when mounted on the cradle. The fully rotating frame can be locked in any orientation. The shaft bearings, which stay attached to frame, are easily unbolted from the rolling cradle, allowing the frame, and attached chamber, to be moved by crane, independently of the heavy cradle. The cradle has a rigid rectangular frame, 1.3 \(\times\) 5m\({}^{2}\) long and rides on heavy-duty casters. It is designed to fit through all doorways and

around the hallway corners. The chamber support arms, which link the frame to a chamber, are mounted to rigid cross members of the frame. They consist of fixed sleeves, axially aligned with KM, which hold extendable 19 mm pins that lock into the kinematic mounts.

Mounting a Chamber A crane with spreader bar is used to pick the empty frame off of the cradle and position it, horizontally, over a completed chamber. The frame is lowered slowly into position, with people at each corner, and sliding steel pins are locked into the 4 kinematic mounts. The crane is then used to lift chamber and frame, and put them on the cradle. The chamber and frame are then rotated into a vertical position and the axles locked. Space constraints in the building dictate that the chamber must be in a vertical position during transport since the doors will not accommodate the chamber in a horizontal orientation. The frame and chamber can rotate a full 360\({}^{\circ}\) in the cradle, allowing access to both sides of the completed chamber for installation of electronics, Faraday cages, gas system and sensors. Removing a chamber from the cart is a reversal of the above procedure.

## 13 Crating and Shipment

The Michigan ATLAS group designed and construct a chamber shipping crates after an unsuccessful attempt to find a suitable outside vendor. The design uses a light-weight steel frame, made of \(1^{\prime\prime}\times 1^{\prime\prime}\) welded tubing, to which \(3/4"\) thick removable plywood panels are bolted with self-threading steel screws. These panels are lined on the inside with \(1"\) thick styrofoam for thermal insulation. A single chamber rests horizontally within each crate on a \(4"\) thick cushion of soft polyurethane foam for impact protection. Further foam inserts, placed on top and along the sides of the chamber, protect against rebound and side impacts. An empty EMS5 crate weighs about 930 lbs and costs $1900 for material and labor. Figure 16 show a picture of the shipping crate.

To date (Nov. 2001) a total of 25 chambers have been shipped to CERN via sea container transport. Transit time door-to door is typically about three weeks. The chambers are instrumented with shock sensors with thresholds

of 15g and 25g. So far, no sensors have been triggered, and all crates have arrived with no visible damage. The end plywood panels of the crates are easily removed. We have opened 10 of the 25 crates to check for broken drift-tube wires (each chamber has 384 tubes). So far, no wires have been broken in transit or in storage.

## 14 Chamber Production Database

The University of Michigan MDT Chamber production is monitored by our production database system. The production database system uses ACCESS 2000 as the underlying database and has been described in an ATLAS note[5]. Numerous enhancements have been developed to allow users to access, plot and modify the database contents thru the WWW.

Data related to chamber production is collected from "stations" related to each step of the production, exactly analogous to the MDT tube production. From the database's point of view a "station" is just a specifically formatted text file containing all the relevant information for that production step. We have created data acquisition software which manages each step of the chamber production and produces the station data file as formatted text. In principle each "station" could exist on its own computer or a single computer could host all of our stations. In practice we need to have a number of stations working

in parallel during chamber production.

The complete list of stations for chamber production is shown in the following table:

**Chamber Related Production Stations**

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Station** & **Purpose** \\ \hline ATGLUE & Chamber gluing station \\ \hline ATRSNK & Chamber measurement station \\ \hline ATBCAL & Chamber spacer assembly and measurement station \\ \hline ATCHTST & Chamber testing station: leak-check, current \\ \hline \end{tabular}

In addition we have other production related computers for parts inventory tracking, backup and technical drawings. Figure 17 shows all the production related stations, including those used for tube production.

We track a number of relevant parameters during the construction of the chamber: gluing information (including timings, tube locations, glue used), spacer assembly information, inplane alignment measurements after spacer gluing, stiff-back measurements before and after gluing, and a number of chamber test parameters. The four stations in table 14 each have their own dedicated computer and data acquisition software and hardware.

We have found that there are a number of other things we wish to track related to the state of each chamber. To to this we have created a WWW interface which implements a "chamber-checklist". This allows us to use any available computer with a WWW browser to check or update (via authenticated access) the status of each chamber. Table 2 shows the information we are tracking in the checklist for each chamber. This information can then be printed or copied to CD to provide an "electronic" traveler to send with each chamber.

Additional related chamber information, including current drawings and downloadable chamber specific database summaries, are available from our WWW page at [http://atlas.physics.lsa.umich.edu/aspdb/main.asp](http://atlas.physics.lsa.umich.edu/aspdb/main.asp).
