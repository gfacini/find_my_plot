###### Abstract

This note presents a design of preshower which is integrated in the accordeon geometry and gives a stereo vue of the impact point of a particle. Ministrips are drawn on the first sampling of the kapton electrodes. Such kaptons will be tested in the RD3 prototype in the run July 94.

The variables

A point M on a kapton electrode is described by its polar angle \(\theta\) ( or its rapidity \(\eta\)), and its azimuthal angle \(\phi\) (see figure 1).

Rapidity is defined such that rapidity differences are conserved under any Lorentz boost along the beam line. Other variables have the same properties : the transverse momentum \(p_{T}\) and the azimuthal angle. Then the distance in rapidity and azimuth between photons from \(\pi^{0}\) of fixed \(p_{T}\) is constant. Thus, \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) are natural variables for a preshower.

Integrated preshowers in the accordion structure cannot measure \(\phi\). Indeed, the location of electronics on the front and rear faces of the calorimeter hinder this measurement. However, a linear combination of \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) can be formed :

\[u=\eta-\sigma\phi,v=\eta+\sigma\phi \tag{1}\]

A photon travelling from the pp vertex has a constant \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) i.e. constant u and v. Strips \(\delta\)u (\(\delta\)v) fully contain the photon line of flight. \(\sigma\) is a stereo parameter : \(\sigma=0\) gives the "GEM" preshower, \(\sigma\)=1 produces a u,v strips at 90\({}^{\circ}\).

## 2 Definition of a strip

Strips borders are defined by :

\[u=\eta-\sigma\phi=cst\qquad\qquad v=\eta+\sigma\phi=cst \tag{2}\]

u strips are drawn on one kapton; v strips on the next one in azimuth; then u strips again on the next one and so on. The azimuthal angle between kaptons is \(\epsilon\) : \(\epsilon{=}\frac{2\pi}{N_{tot}}\) where \(N_{tot}\) is the total number of electrodes in the barrel.

For fabrication reasons, all "u" ("v") kaptons must be identical. They can be deduced one from the next by a rotation in azimuth of \(2\epsilon\). The equation of strip borders (2) thus implies that the pattern formed by strip borders should be invariant by a translation along the z axis : \(\eta\rightarrow\eta\pm 2\sigma\epsilon\). This constrains the strip width in the \(\eta\) direction :

\[\delta\eta=2\sigma\epsilon/n\qquad\mbox{($n$ integer number)}\]

The constraint disappears in the GEM case (\(\sigma=0\)); indeed, by rotation, a strip border is its own image contrary to the general case (\(\sigma\neq 0\))

In addition, one may ask that calorimeter cell borders match strips borders at the transition between the strip region and the calorimeter region i.e. at \(\phi{=}0\). The calorimeter cell width in the \(\eta\) direction is then \(\Delta\eta=M\delta\eta\). If \(\Delta\eta\) is already fixed, the stereo angle is

\[\sigma=\frac{n\Delta\eta}{2M\epsilon}\]

In the azimuthal direction, a calorimeter cell is made by grouping N kapton electrodes i.e. \(\Delta\phi=N\epsilon\). The constraint \(\Delta\eta=\Delta\phi\) (square cells) translates into

\[2M\sigma=Nn\]

A long u (v) strip is obtained connecting on the calorimeter front face a strip from one kapton to the strips displaced by \(\pm 2\sigma\epsilon\) on the next kapton of the same family (see figure 3 and SS4).

## 3 Drawing a strip on a kapton electrode

### Variables for the geometry

Let's consider an electrode as a serie of planes, each corresponding to a zig. Let P be the incident point of a particle coming from the vertex O onto the middle of the zig. OP defines the origin of the azimuth. P is at a distance R from the beam line, at a rapidity \(\eta\)(P). The angle of a zig with OP is \(\alpha\) (zero, positive or negative)(see figure 1 and 2).

A point in the zig plane is defined by its two coordinates :

* z parallel to the beam direction ( z=0 corresponds to \(\eta{=}0\))
* p perpendicular to z ( see figure 2)

A strip border going through P will be defined by the coordinates(p,z) of its points as a function of the azimuthal angle \(\phi\).

### Equation of a strip border

From figure 2 :

\[\tan\phi=\frac{p\sin\alpha}{R+p\cos\alpha}\Rightarrow p=R\frac{\sin\phi}{\sin( \alpha-\phi)}\]

The z coordinate is defined by the strip equation u=cst : \(\eta(M)=\eta(P)\pm\sigma\phi(M)\).

The distance between M and the beam line is : R cos\(\phi\) +p cos\((\alpha-\phi)\) = R \(\frac{\sin\alpha}{\sin(\alpha-\phi)}\).

Polar angle \(\theta\) and rapidity \(\eta\) are related :

\[\eta=-\ln\left(\tan\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\qquad\tan\theta=\frac{1}{\sinh\eta} \qquad\sin\theta=\frac{1}{\cosh\eta}\]

From this, we deduce :

\[z=\frac{R\sin\alpha}{\sin(\alpha-\phi)}\sinh(\eta(P)\pm\sigma\phi)\]

### Tangent to the strip border

From the strip border equations above, we compute :

\[\frac{dp}{d\phi}=\frac{R\sin\alpha}{\sin^{2}(\alpha-\phi)}\]

Figure 2: Definition of the variables used to describe the geometry\[\frac{dz}{d\phi}=\frac{dp}{d\phi}\left[\cos(\alpha-\phi)\sinh(\eta(P)\pm\sigma\phi) \pm\sigma\sin(\alpha-\phi)\cosh(\eta(P)\pm\sigma\phi))\right]\]

\[\frac{dz}{d\phi}=\frac{dp}{d\phi}\left[\frac{\cos(\alpha-\phi)}{\tan\theta}\pm \sigma\frac{\sin(\alpha-\phi)}{\sin\theta}\right]\]

The tangent to the strip border on the electrode is given by :

\[\tan\beta=\frac{dz}{dp}=\cos(\alpha-\phi)\sinh(\eta(P)\pm\sigma\phi)\pm\sigma \sin(\alpha-\phi)\cosh(\eta(P)\pm\sigma\phi))\]

\[\tan\beta=\frac{\cos\theta\cos(\alpha-\phi)\pm\sigma\sin(\alpha-\phi)}{\sin \theta}\]

which is not constant with \(\phi\). The strip border is not a straight line.

To first order in \(\phi\), we have :

\[\tan\beta=\cos\alpha\sinh(\eta(P))\pm\sigma\sin\alpha\cosh(\eta(P))+\phi\left[ \sin\alpha\sinh(\eta(P))(1+\sigma^{2})\right]\]

For \(\alpha=45^{o}\), \(\sigma\)=1 and \(\eta\)=1.2, this gives :

\[\tan\beta=2.348(-0.213)+2.135\phi\quad with\quad-0.01<\phi<0.01\]

i.e. \(66.7^{o}<\beta<67.1^{o}\) for u strips, -10.8\({}^{o}<\beta<\) -13.2\({}^{o}\) for v strips

### Strip width

The strip width w on the kapton at point P (\(\phi\)=0) can be computed as :

\[w=\delta z\cos\beta=R\frac{\delta\eta}{\sin\theta}\cos\beta\]

\[w=R\frac{\delta\eta}{\sqrt{\sin^{2}\theta+(\cos\theta\cos\alpha\pm\sigma\sin \alpha)^{2}}}\]

For \(\alpha\)=45\({}^{o}\), \(\sigma\)=1 the compaction factor \(\rho=\frac{w}{R\delta\eta}\) is :

\[\begin{array}{cccc}\eta&0&0.4&0.8&1.2\\ \theta&90^{o}&67.7^{o}&48.4^{o}&33.5^{o}\\ \rho_{u}\mbox{ for }\alpha=45^{o}&0.816&0.976&1.27&1.77\\ \rho_{v}\mbox{ for }\alpha=45^{o}&0.816&0.744&0.717&0.710\end{array}\]

Note that for \(\alpha=135^{o}\) (the descending zig), the width of the u and v strips are interchanged ( \(\cos\alpha\rightarrow-\cos\alpha\)).

## 4 Electronic connections

As was explained in section 2, we have the constraint :

\[\delta\eta=\frac{2\sigma\epsilon}{n}\]

which means that the strip L has its image on the strip L\(\pm\sigma\)n on the kapton which is at \(\delta\phi=2\epsilon\) further. We have to connect strips which belong to the same initial strips. We could connect a lot of strips but for, pile up reasons, a finite number of strips \(N_{co}\) are connected together. The figure 3 describes an example of connections :Then the total number of channels is :

\[N_{channels}=\frac{3N_{RD5}M}{N_{oo}}\]

where \(N_{RD5}\) is the number of channels of the first sampling of the RD3 prototype.

## 5 Application to the existing 2m prototype

### Lateral description of the u v preshower

The present 2m prototype has :

* \(\Delta\eta\) = 0.01764
* \(N_{tot}\) = 960 i.e. \(\epsilon\)=6.54 mrad

If we cut each calorimeter cell in 4 ( M=4) \(\rightarrow\)\(\delta\eta\) = 0.00441.

Then \(\sigma\) = n \(\frac{\Delta\eta}{M}\frac{N_{tot}}{4\pi}\)= n\(\times\)0.3369.

Choosing n=3, the stereo parameter is \(\sigma\) = 1.0107.

The strip width in the u direction is : \(\delta\eta\)=\(\frac{\delta\eta}{\sqrt{1+\sigma^{2}/2}}\)=0.0036.

The smallest geometrical strip width on the kapton at \(\eta\)=0.8 is : 4.43 mm for R=1.4 m ( middle of the first sampling)

We have decided to connect \(N_{oo}\)=6 strips together which means that the number of channel for the first sampling is doubled.

### Depth of the preshower

The depth of a preshower is a compromise between the resolution in energy and the rejection \(\pi^{o}/\gamma\). We have choosen to take 3 zigs for the preshower as described in figure 4.

We then obtain the following capacitances for the cells of the RD3 calorimeter :

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Sampling & Capacitance(\(\eta\)=0.42) & Capacitance(\(\eta\)=0.85) \\ u or v & 59 pF & 75 pF \\
2 & 400 pF & 520 pF \\
3 & 532 pF & 669 pF \\ \hline \end{tabular}

These capacitances are computed from the surfaces of strips. It does not take into account the additional capacitance from cross-talk which will be computed in a following note.

### Design of uv preshower for the RD3 calorimeter

The parameters which are used in the previous chapters lead to the design of kaptons which is shown in figures 5 and 6.

If the design of the strips is right, their borders must align for a particle which comes from the vertex ( which is equivalent to look at the strips from the vertex). The figure 7 shows that it aligns only where the particle hit the calorimeter. Figure 8 shows that the borders do not align when you look from somewhere else.
