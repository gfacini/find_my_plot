**Abstract**

This note presents the analysis of the 1997 test beam data on the extended barrel prototypes using two different algorithms, the benchmark method and an algorithm based on the H1 weighting method, also used for the 1994 combined test analysis [1]. The linearity and resolution of the extended barrel modules are simultaneously optimized. The weighting method makes use of only 7 parameters, plus the beam energy. Moreover the method can be used without assuming prior knowledge of the pion energy, as in a real experimental situation.

**1 Test Beam Setup**

The set-up configuration in the October 97 Test Beam was performed out with two extended barrel prototypes (Barcelona (BCN) and Argon (ANL)) and five 1 meter modules (old modules). In order to improve the transverse leakage for both, the two extended barrel modules were sandwiched between the 1m prototype modules, as it is shown below.

The division choosed for the prototype geometry was 3-4-4 [2] as it can be seen in figure 1 (right). The modules have 3 segments in depth, corresponding to 1.37, 2.48 and 3.14 interaction lengths at \(\eta\)=0. The cell geometry is defined such that to be semi-projective as in ATLAS.

Both modules were built identically respect to the mechanic, but there are some differences in the readout electronic:

* Compressed circuits for ANL Module (1 ADC).
* Half of compressed circuits and half of bi-gain (2 ADCs, one with high gain and one with low gain) for BCN module.

**2. Data Sample**

Pion events of different energies (40, 50, 80, 100, 180, 300 and 400 GeV) at \(\eta\)=-1.1 and \(\eta\)=-1.2 have been used in this analysis. On average, about ten thousand events

**3. Energy Reconstruction.**

The resolution and linearity of a non-compensated calorimeter for hadrons are degraded by the different response to the electromagnetic and hadronic components of the hadronic shower [4]. The dependence of the _e/h_ value with the energy affects the linearity, meanwhile the presence of the electromagnetic component in the shower generated by an hadron increases the resolution. Alltogether with these physic effects, which are limiting the intrinsic resolution of the detector, it has to be added the always experimental contributions, basically the losses due to leakage.

The purpose of weighting techniques is to compensate for this difference and to perform the energy reconstruction optimizing the linearity and resolution. We study here in three steps the evolution of the linearity and resolution parameters in the data reconstruction, from raw data to HI weighting method going through the benchmark method.

**3.1 Raw Data.**

The first step in the linearity and resolution study was the direct analysis of the raw data. The three components of the total raw energy are the energy detected in the BCN, ANL and the five 1 m modules. Energy in BCN and ANL modules has been corrected for the cross-talk problem [3], and the conversion factors from pC to GeV were calculated to be 1.26 GeV/pC for extended barrels and 0.1613 GeV/pC for old modules. So finally:

\[E_{Raw}=E_{ANL}^{corr}+E_{BCN}^{corr}+E_{old} \tag{1}\]

According to this expresion we present the results of \(\mu\), \(\sigma\) and \(\sigma/\mu\) in table 1. Also the plots of linearity and energy resolution can be seen in figures 4 and 5.

The linearity presents the typical shape of a non-compensated calorimeter, the slope is due to the increase of electromagnetic energy in the shower produced by a pion with the energy of this pion. The _rms_ is around 4.3% for both modules and both values of \(\eta\), which is one of the characteristics to improve.

A fit of the data is performed in the way:

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{\mathbf{a}\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus\mathbf{b}\%\oplus\frac{ \mathbf{c}}{E} \tag{2}\]

where \(\mathbf{a}\) represents the statistical fluctuations in the shower development, \(\mathbf{b}\) is the constant term dominant at high energies and \(\mathbf{c}\) is the noise term. The fit gives \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{40.88\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 5.61\%\oplus\frac{1.26}{E}\) and \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{31.5\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 5.17\%\oplus\frac{1.74}{E}\) for BCN module at \(\eta\)=-1.1

and \(\eta\)=-1.2, respectively. For A NL module we have obtained \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{45.\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 5.35\%\oplus\frac{1.27}{E}\) for \(\eta\)=-1.1 and \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{43.3\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 6.24\%\oplus\frac{1.56}{E}\) for \(\eta\)=-1.2.

The study presented in Appendix B shows the strong correlation between parameters **a** and **c**, so that we have decided to fix the value of **c** at 0.06 GeV in order to obtain less aleatory results in the **a** value and to compare with other fits. The figure 6 shows the same data but fitted with this new consideration.

The results taking into account this ide a give for BCN module \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{46.7\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 5.34\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) and \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{43.7\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 4.8\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) for \(\eta\)=-1.1 and \(\eta\)=-1.2 respectively. For A NL we obtained \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{51.7\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 5.09\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) and \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{49.9\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 6.04\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) for the same values of \(\eta\). About the resolution, we can conclude that in general the requirement is reached. Moreover it can be seen that BCN module has better resolution than ANL.

**3.2 Benchmark.**

This method tries to correct the effect of the lateral and longitudinal leakage in the prototype [3]. The used algorithm is:

\[E_{TOT}=X[E_{tot}^{ANL}+E_{tot}^{BCN}+(A-1)(E_{S3}^{ANL}+E_{S3}^{ANL})]+BE_{old} \tag{3}\]

where \(E_{tot}^{ANL}\) and \(E_{tot}^{BCN}\) is the energy (in pC) detected in the ANL and BCN modules, respectively, corrected by cross-talk and \(E_{S3}^{ANL}\) and \(E_{S3}^{BCN}\) is the energy detected in samples three of ANL and BCN modules. Finally \(E_{old}\) is the energy detected in the five 1 meter modules.

X=1.26 GeV/pC is the conversion factor from pC to GeV for the extended barrels.

(A-1) is the parameter that corrects the energy losses due to the longitudinal leakage of the shower. It is calculated looking at the dependence of the total energy with the energy deposited in sample three of the extended barrels. It is logic to assume that the longitudinal leakage is proportional to the energy deposited in these last samples.

Finally, B takes into account the transversal leakage of the shower. The transversal losses are proportional to the energy deposited in the old modules due to the set up of the experiment. To obtain this parameter, the total energy is plotted as a function of the energy in the old modules. Moreover in this factor we included the conversion factor 0.1613 GeV/pC for the 1 meter modules. An example of this representations is shown in figure 7.

In table 2 are showed the results obtained with the present method.

A similar behavior as for direct raw data is obtained for linearity (figure 8). _rms_ changes from 4.3% to 4.5% in this analysis. This is logic if we consider that the benchmark method doesn't correct the non-compensation of the detector. A short improvement can be seen in the linearity of points at high energies.

The resolution fits (figure 9) give \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{50.1\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 3.10\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) and \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{52.2\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 4.21\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) for BCN module at \(\eta\)=-1.1 and \(\eta\)=-1.2, respectively. For ANL the results are \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{51.5\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 4.87\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) at \(\eta\)=-1.1 and \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{59.1\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 3.71\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) at \(\eta\)=-1.2. There is a clear improvement in \(\mathbf{b}\), the dominant parameter at high energies, where the Benchmark method corrects the leakage.

**3.3 H1 Method**

As it has been pointed out, the previous results were not quite satisfactory: after applying a benchmark technique, an improvement in the parameter \(\mathbf{b}\) of the resolution was obtained but the linearity is still quite poor.

An independent approach inspired in the H1 collaboration was decided to try.

Table 2: _Nominal energy, mean reconstructed energy, \(\sigma\) and resolution at various beam energies and two different \(\eta\) for BCN and ANL modules obtained from benchmark method._Instead of correcting _upwards_ the response of cells with relatively small signals, this method pretends to equalize their responses to the one of cells with large desposited energies.

The energy in each cell, \(E_{cell}\), is corrected multiplying its value by a parameter \(a_{i}\)[5] which depends on the energy of the cell:

\[E_{Cell}^{Cor}=a_{i}\times E_{Cell} \tag{4}\]

In this analysis a noise cut has been applied to the energy for the cells of the two extended barrel modules; this helps in parametrizing the \(a_{i}\), because of the unstable behaviour they show in the noise region. The applied cut is the following:

\[|Ecells|>0.056\ GeV/Cell \tag{5}\]

The cut value was chosen from the plot shown in figure 10; the criteria are the _RMS_ of the pedestal noise in the two modules.

The technical details of the method have been described in ATLAS-TILECAL-NO-75. As first step, for each beam energy, the cell energy spectrum is divided into

Figure 9: _Energy resolution plots obtained with Benchmark method. Left: for \(\eta\)=-1.1 BCN (top) and ANL (bottom) modules. Right: for \(\eta\)=-1.2, BCN and ANL modules, respectively. Parameter c fixed._

n intervals [1] and a correction parameter _a_i is calculated for each interval. Two sets of parameters are calculated for the ANL and BCN module, respectively.

The _a_i are obtained from de data at each energy, writing the corrected energy of event \(k\) as

\[E_{cor}^{K}=a_{1}\ E_{1}^{K}+...+a_{n}\ E_{n}^{K}+B\ E_{old} \tag{6}\]

In this expression:

\(\bullet\ E_{i}^{K}\) is the sum of the energy of all the cells within interval \(i\), i.e.

\[E_{i}^{K}=\sum_{cell\,\textit{i}\in i}E_{Cell} \tag{7}\]

\(\bullet\ E_{old}\) is the energy released in the old modules.

The set of correction parameter _a_i is determined from the data by minimizing the expression

\[N\ \sigma^{2}=\sum_{K=1,N}(E_{cor}^{K}-E_{Beam})^{2}+\lambda\sum_{K=1,N}(E_{cor }^{K}-E_{Beam}) \tag{8}\]

in which the constraint that the mean reconstructed energy has to reproduce the nominal beam energy is introduced by means of a Lagrange multiplier.

The corrected total energy spectra were fitted with Gaussian distributions over a \(\pm 2\sigma\) range. From the mean values of the fits we obtain plots of the deviation from a linear response. Such "linearity plots", are shown in figure 11, left \(\eta\)=-1.1 and right \(\eta\)=-1.2, respectively. The improvement when including the "energy conservation" constraint is very clear; with this constraint, the _rms_ deviation from linearity is 0.4% and 0.4% for BCN module and \(\eta\)=-1.1 and -1.2, respectively. For ANL module the _rms_ are 0.34% and 0.12%.

The energy resolution (\(\sigma/E\)_vs._ the beam energy) is given in figure 12. The resolution obtained here can be parametrized as \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{36.9\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 3.9\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) and \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{40.5\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 3.2\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) for BCN module and for a \(\eta\)=-1.1 and -1.2 respectively, where \(E\) is en GeV and the \(\oplus\) symbol indicates sum in quadrature. For ANL module the resolution obtained was \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{40.5\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 3.9\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) and \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{36.3\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 4.9\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) for a \(\eta\)= -1.1 and -1.2 respectively.

The results of the fits to the reconstructed pion energies are given in table 3.

#### 3.3.1 Parametrizing the \(a_{i}\)

A total of 112 parameters are used to reconstruct the pion energy in the Tile Calorimenter: (13 + 1) at each of the 8 beam energies. To reduce the number of parameters we proceed as follows:

\(\bullet\) The \(a_{i}\) are parametrized as a function of the cell energy in the way: \(y=p_{1}+p_{2}/E_{cell}\) (with different values \(p_{1}\), \(p_{2}\) for the BCN and ANL modules). The results are shown in figure 13 and 14 for various beam energies and \(\eta\)=-1.1 and -1.2.

The errors on the \(a_{i}\) shown in the figure are the _rms_ values of ten independent sets of \(a_{i}\) obtained by classifying the data in 10 independent subsamples at each energy and solving the minimization equations for each set.

\(\bullet\) Next, the parameters \(p_{1}\), \(p_{2}\) and \(B\) (the old modules parameter) are expressed as a fuction of the beam energy using simple two and three parameter dependence. This is shown in figures 15, 16 and 17; for ANL and BCN modules at \(\eta\)=-1.1 and -1.2.

Following theses parametrizations, we have expressed the entire set of corrections by two sets of simple functions, containing only a total of seven parameters. The aim now is to check whether the energies reconstructed with 7 rather than 112 parameters are less precise. The mean, \(\sigma\) and resolution values obtained from this parametrization

Two different algorithms have been considered to obtain the initial estimate of the particle energy:

The first one assumes that the sum of the cell energies follows a linear behaviour [1] (plus the old modules correction).

The second uses the raw signal value.

The first is applied for \(\eta\)=-1.2 and the second for \(\eta\)=-1.1. Both algorithms converge practically to the same value of the total energy after 3 or 4 iterations.

The mean, \(\sigma\) and resolution on the reconstructed energies are presented in table 5. In figure 20 the linearity obtained by the "realistic" method is shown; the linearity remains as good as before. For ANL module the non-linearity ranges from 1.8% to 2.2% for \(\eta\)=-1.1 and from 2.9% to 3.4% for \(\eta\) = -1.2. For BCN module it goes from 1.2% to 2% and 3.0% to 3.5% for \(\eta\)=-1.1 and -1.2 respectively.

The resolutions obtained with the realistic algorithm, as we see in figure 21 present a slight degradation with respect to the values given in the preceding parametrization that uses the nominal beam energy. This result is unavoidable due to event-to-event fluctuations of hadronic showers. The figure shows that the degradation of the

resolution is more pronounced at low energy, as expected from the energy dependence of \(\sigma/E\).

The final result is: \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{45.6\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 2.7\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) and \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{47.8\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 2.3\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) for BCN module and for a \(\eta\)=-1.1 and -1.2 respectively, where \(E\) is in  GeV. For ANL module the resolution obtained was \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{45.2\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 3.1\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) and \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{44.5\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 3.9\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) for a \(\eta\)=-1.1 and -1.2 respectively.

## 4 Conclusions

In this study we have proved that the linearity and resolution of the Tile Calorimeter prototypes improve using the H1 method. Also these results are compatible for the two modules used in the 1997 test beam and two different values of \(\eta\).

Respect to the linearity, the benchmark approach gives aproximately the same _rms_ than the raw data, improving a little at high energies due to the leakage corrections. Using Lagrange multipliers we found a very linear response over the range of energies studied, because 112 weights have been used for each module. With the parametrization of these weights using a total of 7 constants and assuming no knowledge of the particle energy the linearity is degraded appreciably. This degradation is not seen in the 1994 combined test analysis and it is caused by the difficulty in the parametrization, due to the bad quality of data; however it is still better than with the benchmark method.

For the resolution, figure 22 shows that the use of all those weights improves significantly the resolution respect to the raw data algorithm. As expected, the resolution degrades somewhat when no knowledge of the particle energy is assumed, been better than the obtained with the other methods.

## Appendix A

At low beam energies (below 50 GeV) the resolution deteriorates appreciably, as observed with all reconstruction methods. This confirms that the problem is intrinsic to the data set. We describe here the results obtained for the linearity and resolution if only we consider energies greater than 40 GeV and reconstructing the beam energy using the 3.3.1 point.

The mean, \(\sigma\) and resolution values obtained are given in the table 6; the linearity and resolution plots are in figure 23 and 24. Comparing to the results previously obtained with beam energies below 50 GeV it is seen that the resolution is practically the same and the linearity has improved. Quantitatively, the _rms_ deviation from linearity is now \(\sigma\) = 2.0% and 0.6% instead of 2.12% and 2.8% for \(\eta\)=-1.1 and \(\Lambda\)NL and BCN modules respectively. For \(\eta\)=-1.2 the _rms_ is now \(\sigma\) = 2.0% and 1.5% instead of 2.9% and 3% for ANL and BCN modules.

The resolution is now parametrized as \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{45.7\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 2.7\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) and \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{44.3\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 2.5\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) for BCN module and for a \(\eta\)=-1.1 and -1.2 respectively, where \(E\) is in GeV. For ANL module the resolution obtained was \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{47.2\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 3.0\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) and \(\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{41.1\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 4.1\%\oplus\frac{0.06}{E}\) for a \(\eta\)=-1.1 and -1.2 respectively.

## Appendix B

The **c** parameter in the expresion 9 takes into account the different noise contributions in the detector. It can be measured independently of resolution studies and has been estimated from noise _rms_ which mean is around 0.06 GeV (figure 10) [6].

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{a\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus b\%\oplus\frac{c}{E} \tag{9}\]

If we do the fit of this expresion with these three parameters free then the **c** parameter can take no representative values, it is due to the characteristics of the experimental data. These values affect directly to the **a** values as it can be seen in figure 25, impeding to compare the **a** parameters obtained from different methods.

In figure 25 is shown the strong relation between the two parameters **a** and **c** when we do the fit of the typical resolution expression.

In this analysis all the resolution fits have been done fixing **c**=0.06 GeV (according to the mean in figure 10) and fitting with **a** and **b** free. In figure 25 it can be seen that at **c**=0.06 GeV the **a** value reach a plateau.
