8 February 1995Introduction

There is a measurement of vibrations in experimental halls of LEP, which gives vibration amplitude about 1 \(\mu\)m. The same amplitude can be considered for ATLAS. Such vibrations can excite wire vibrations inside drift tube. What will be amplitude of wire vibrations? Can a spacer inside drift tube decrease the amplitude of wire vibration? It seems the questions are essential for high-resolution drift tubes of ATLAS muon spectrometer.

We started test of wire vibrations inside long drift tube to obtain the experimental answer for the questions listen above. Below are the first results of the test.

## 2 Setup

The 6 m long stainless steel tube with 30 mm outer diameter and wall thickness 0.5 mm is used for the test. 50 \(\mu\)m gold plated tungsten wire is stretched with tension of 300 g and crimped in pins. The pins are inserted in endplugs made of polymethilmethacrylate.

The tube vibration is excited by vibrator attached to the tube near its end ( fig.1 ). The vibrator consists of Al-alloy cylinder ( 120 mm diameter and 240 mm length ) and electrical motor with eccentric rotor at the bottom of the cylinder. Weight of the motor is 0.4 kg. There is a load (Al-alloy cylinder with 60 mm diameter and 600 mm length ), which is fixed to the opposite end of the tube. Distance from the tube end to the load ( L ) is equal to one from the vibrator to another tube end. The vibrator and the load are hung by rubber laces. The tube ends are placed on the vibrator and the load top. There is an additional soft support in the middle of the tube.

The attachment of the vibrator to the tube is schematically shown in fig.2. The length of conjunction along the tube is 8 mm. We named such type of conjunction as a "week bond". Another type of conjunction is composed from two pieces like one shown in fig.2 distance between which along the tube is 80 mm. Such type of conjunction was named a "strong bond". The attachment of the load to the tube is made like the "weak bond".

An amplitude of vibration is measured by microscope. There are three holes in the tube wall to see amplitudes of the first four wire resonances. The vibration amplitude of the tube and one of the vibrator were measured at the points marked by crosses in fig.1.

All measurements were performed with Ar filling of the tube at normal conditions. The high pressure tests were done with Ar and CO\({}_{2}\).

## 3 Measurements and results

Three components ( A\({}_{\mu}\), A\({}_{y}\), A\({}_{z}\) ) of vibration amplitude for free vibrator (without a tube) as functions of frequency are presented in fig.3. Increasing of A\({}_{z}\) with frequency is caused by electrical motor resonance at 120 Hz. In the drawing and in all next ones we use the frequency of electrical power supply generator, which value slightly differs from the mechanical one ( fig.11 ).

The same three components of the amplitude for the vibrator attached to the tube by the "week bond" are shown in fig.4a. Resonant structure due to tube resonances can be seen for all three components, vertical vibration tube resonances contribute to A\({}_{y}\) and horizontal ones to A\({}_{\pi}\) and A\({}_{z}\). A digit above a peak indicates the resonance number which was determinated by means of finger touching to the tube. Such methode is quite enough because of large amplitude of the tube vibration. The digits with (') or ( " ) above them mean that the resonance is not a simple one but the distance between the vibrator and the first vibration node is more or less than the one between two neighbouring nodes.

Vertical vibration amplitude of the tube ( fig.4b ) shows more distinct resonant structure than one of the vibrator. The first four resonances of the wire are shown in fig.4b too. It seems that there is not a coincidence of the wire resonances and tube ones. The amplitudes and frequencies of the wire resonances are given in table 1.

Fig.5a shows the amplitudes of the vibrator and the tube for the case of the "strong bond" between the tube and vibrator. It is seen large difference of tube resonant vibration structure for two types of conjunction between the tube and vibrator. The tube resonant amplitudes for the "strong bond" increase about 6 times as compare to the "week bond". The wire resonant amplitudes increase also ( fig.5b ). The 2nd, 3d and 4th wire resonances are exposed to influence of the tube resonances with number of 4', 5' and 6'. Amplitudes of the wire resonances and their comparison with ones for the "weak bond" are given in the table 1. It seems that "strong bond" increasing factor for resonant wire vibration amplitude can achieve the one for the tube, which is about of 6.

We assume that the "weak bond" is more close to MDT-chamber in ATLAS conditions. All further results will be given for this type of conjunction of the tube and vibrator.

Resonant wire vibration amplitudes ( RWVA ) normalized to the vertical amplitude of the free vibrator versus distance ( L ) between the vibrator and tube end are presented in fig.6( a,b.,c,d) for four wire resonances. Different markers depict results of several sets of measurements performed at different time. Variation of the amplitudes for different sets is \(\pm\) 20 % due to imperfection of the tube and its conjunction with the vibrator.

The dependences shown in fig.6 have periodic shape. The period decreases with increasing of the resonance number. Such behavior is caused by amplification of the wire vibration by free tube ends. The tube resonances contribute in the wire vibration too. The wire resonance frequencies ( dashed lines ) and tube ones'as functions of L are shown in fig.7. Digits indicate the resonance numbers. It is seen that there is possibility of interference of the tube resonances and the wire ones: for the 1st wire resonance at L = 10 cm, for the 2nd one at L = 40 cm and for 4th one at L = 20 cm. Only last case is well evident in fig.6d with amplification factor for the wire amplitude about 2. The first two cases of interference are not distinguished well and the amplification factors for them are less than 2. So, the behaviour of RWVAs shown in fig.6 is caused mainly by free tube ends. The situation is very depressive. For any L greater 0 always there is a RWVA with amplification factor about 10 as compare to initial case for L=0 when the normalized amplitude of the 1st, 2nd, 3d and 4th wire resonance is 90, 50, 40 and 30 accordingly. We tried to find the solution of the problem by loading free ends of tube. Fig.8 shows the dependences of RWVAs for different loads attached to free tube ends. The load of 300 g gives significant decreasing of RWVAs and further increasing of the load does not influence. The most conservative is the 1st resonance. We were not able to decrease its normalized amplitude less than 55. There is the best situation with 300 g load at L \(\simeq\) 90 cm where the normalized amplitudes ( 75, 21, 20 and 26 ) are less than for L=0.

In this case a wire support ( spacer ) in the middle of the tube will give 3 times decreasing of maximal RWVA because of suppression of odd number resonances. But at L \(\simeq\) 110 cm the normalized RWVAs for four resonances are 67, 25, 29, 66 and the spacer in the middle of the tube will not give bonus.

The pressure dependences of RWVA were measured for pressure range of 1-4 atm with Ar or CO2 gas filling of the tube. The RWVAs decrease with increasing of gas pressure ( fig.9 ). The decreasing is slightly dependent on the resonance number. At the same pressure RWVA is larger for CO2 filling as compare to the Ar one. The tube resonant behaviour does not change noticeably with increasing of gas pressure from 1 to 4 atm (fig.10 ).

## 4 Conclusion

The resonant wire vibration can spoil resolution of the drift tube. Normalized resonant wire vibration amplitude (RWVA) can exceed 1000.

There are several ways to decreasing of vibration effect.

1. The conjunction of the tube with support must be as "weak" as possible, it allows to decrease maximal RWVA by factor we think about 6.
2. The tube supports must be placed at the tube ends,then all wire resonances have small amplitude simultaneously and maximal normalized RWVA is less than 90.
3. If the tube supports can not be placed at the tube ends then it is necessary to find their optimal positions and to use loads at the tube ends, for optimal case the maximal normalized RWVA is less than 70.
4. What will give spacer ( wire support ) in the middle of the tube?

* The spacer in the middle of the tube decreases the maximal normalized RWVA by about 3 times for the optimal tube supports arrangement. But the factor can drop to 1 if the the tube supports are not optimized.
* The spacer factor is about 2 for the tube supports placed at the tube ends.

For any case the spacer factor can drop to about 1 if an interference of wire even resonances with tube resonances takes place.
