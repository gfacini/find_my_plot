###### Abstract

Bulk radiation damage to high resistivity n-type silicon detectors was studied with incident \(\pi^{+}\) (190 MeV) and protons (500 MeV, 647 MeV or 800 MeV). Silicon bulk damage constants were extracted based on proton fluences, \(\Phi\), up to \(\sim\ 8\times 10^{13}/\)cm\({}^{2}\) and for \(\pi^{+}\) fluences up to \(\sim\ 3\times 10^{13}/\)cm\({}^{2}\). Although the measured damage constants for \(\pi^{+}\) and for proton irradiations were different, a simple empirical relationship was proposed to relate the \(\pi^{+}\) and proton radiation damage data. In addition:

1. Activation constants for reverse annealing were determined at four temperatures between 0\({}^{\circ}\)C and 50\({}^{\circ}\)C.
2. 8 silicon detectors were exposed to a second proton fluence of \(\sim 3\times 10^{13}/\)cm\({}^{2}\). The resulting changes in the effective dopant concentration, \(N_{eff}\), were consistent with a model where the bulk radiation effects were purely additive.
3. Following reverse annealing the bulk radiation damage to high resistivity n-type silicon detectors was consistent with the simple functional form: \[N_{eff}(\Phi)=N_{eff}(0)e^{-c\Phi}-(g_{c}+g_{Y})\Phi\] with \(c\), \(g_{c}\) and \(g_{Y}\) damage coefficients measured for \(\pi^{+}\) and proton radiation.

The measured damage coefficients were used to provide detailed predictions for the depletion voltage for the innermost pixel and silicon strip layers in the ATLAS Semi-Conductor Tracker (SCT).

## 1 Overview

Silicon based tracking systems are planned for radiation environments of \(5\cdot 10\)\(\times 10^{13}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}\) for the SVX II vertex detector in CDF [1] and up to \(\sim 6\times 10^{14}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}\) for the pixel layer at 11.5 cm radius in ATLAS [2]. At these fluences bulk radiation damage in silicon significantly changes the effective dopant concentration, \(N_{eff}\). The fluence (\(\Phi\)), temperature (T), and time (t) dependence of these changes are central to the design and operation of future silicon based tracking systems.

In recent years studies of the bulk radiation damage to silicon sensors have identified several changes to the effective dopant concentration. These include:

* donor removal [3-8] (this may result from the formation of vacancy-phosphorous complexes [7] or from _deep_ acceptor states [9]),
* prompt acceptor creation [3-12], and
* creation of electrically inactive defects which interact to form electrically active defects in a second order process termed reverse annealing [12].

Previous studies have found significant temperature dependences to both the _short_ term beneficial annealing [4, 13] and to the _long_ term reverse annealing [10-14]. Following short term annealing the effective dopant concentration, as a function of particle fluence and time, can be parameterized by [7, 12]:

\[N_{eff}(\Phi,t)=N_{eff}(0)\ \ \ -\ \ N_{D}\cdot(1-e^{-c\Phi})\ \ -\ \ g_{c}\cdot\Phi\ \ \ -\ \ g_{Y}\cdot\Phi\cdot R(t,t_{1/2}) \tag{1}\]

where: \(N_{eff}(0)\) is the initial concentration of donor plus acceptor impurities, \(N_{D}\) is the donor concentration removed by radiation 1, and \(g_{c}\) and \(g_{Y}\) parameterize the creation of stable and time dependent defects respectively. \(N_{eff}(\Phi,t)\) is defined to be positive for n-type bulk and negative for p-type bulk. \(R(t,t_{1/2})\) parameterizes the reverse annealing: \(R(0,t_{1/2})=0\) and \(R(\infty,t_{1/2})=1\). For reverse annealing, \(t_{1/2}\) depended on the silicon temperature and the fluence.

Footnote 1: For radiation induced _deep_ acceptor states [9], the electron density, \(n\), contribution to \(N_{eff}\) should decrease approximately linearly with \(\Phi\). At small fluences and for \(N_{D}\thickapprox N_{eff}(0)\), see Sect 3.1, then \(n\thickapprox N_{eff}(0)\ \ -\ N_{D}\cdot(1-e^{-c\Phi})-g_{c}\cdot\Phi\) is approximately \(N_{eff}(0)-(g_{DR}+g_{c})\cdot\Phi\) where \(g_{DR}=N_{eff}(0)\cdot c\). This can be estimated using \(N_{eff}(0)\thickapprox 8\times 10^{11}/cm^{3}\) and \(c=0.96\times 10^{-13}cm^{2}\)[15] for proton irradiation. Thus \(g_{DR}\thickapprox 7.7\times 10^{-2}/cm\) which is similar to but distinctly greater than values for \(g_{c}\thickapprox 1.14\times 10^{-2}/cm\) and \(g_{Y}\thickapprox 4.97\times 10^{-2}/cm\), see Sect. 3.1.

For the Hamamatsu PIN high resistivity n-type silicon sensors used in this study, \(N_{D}\thickapprox N_{eff}(0)\) and the magnitude of \(c\)[15] was such that for \(\pi^{+}\) fluences of \(2\ \times\ 10^{-2}/cm\)\(10^{13}/\rm cm^{2}\) or proton fluences of \(3\ \times 10^{13}/\rm cm^{2}\) the initial dopant was essentially removed 2. As a consequence, silicon bulk damage measurements at these or higher fluences provide a clean environment for the study of \(g_{\varepsilon}\), \(g_{Y}\) and \(R(t,t_{1/2})\).

Footnote 2: By these fluences \(N_{eff}(0)e^{-\,e\,\Phi}\propto V_{dep}\leq 1\)V for the 170\(\mu\)m Hamamatsu PIN diodes.

In this note we report on bulk radiation damage to silicon sensors from incident \(\pi^{+}\) (300 MeV/c = 190 MeV K.E.) and protons (with 500 MeV, 647 MeV or 800 MeV K.E.). The silicon sensors for all damage measurements are \(1\ \rm cm^{2}\) Hamamatsu PIN Photodiodes #S1723-04 with a 170 \(\mu\)m depletion depth [16]. The pion beam fluences were in the range from \(\thicksim 0.4\times 10^{13}/\rm cm^{2}\) to \(\thicksim 3\times 10^{13}/\rm cm^{2}\). The proton beam fluences came from four separate radiation runs. The first and second provided fluences from \(\thicksim 3\times 10^{13}/\rm cm^{2}\) to \(\thicksim 8\times 10^{13}/\rm cm^{2}\). Approximately 1 year after the second radiation exposure, 8 silicon diodes from the second radiation exposure received an additional proton fluence of \(\thicksim 3\times 10^{13}/\rm cm^{2}\). These data were to study radiation damage to silicon sensors which had large prior radiation exposures and that had undergone either little or almost complete reverse annealing. Finally a fourth low fluence run, with proton fluences in the range from \(\thicksim 0.1\times 10^{13}/\rm cm^{2}\) to \(\thicksim 0.6\times 10^{13}/\rm cm^{2}\) provided data to study reverse annealing at low fluences below silicon type inversion.

## 2 Radiation Experiments

Radiation damage to silicon diodes was studied in five separate exposures to high intensity beams. These include 800 MeV protons at LAMPF (July 1991), 647 MeV protons at LAMPF (September 1992), 500 MeV protons at TRIUMF (September 1993 and September 1994) and 190 MeV \(\pi^{+}\) at PSI (June 1994). In all experiments, silicon diodes were exposed to their total fluence over a period of 2-5 days. Most silicon diodes were irradiated at room temperature and then stored at room temperature for a cumulative time of up to \(\thicksim 1\) month (when not at room temperature the diodes were stored at \(\thicksim 1\,\)\({}^{\circ}\)C) before detailed studies of long term reverse annealing (see below). However 2 silicon diodes from the 1991 proton irradiation and 4 from the 1992 proton irradiation were irradiated and stored at 1\({}^{\circ}\)C before detailed studies of reverse annealing. Studies of short term annealing were reported previously [13].

The beam fluences were monitored using aluminum foils placed with the silicon diodes. Activation measurements for the proton exposures were done at LAMPF [11] or at Fermilab [17]. Activation measurements for the pion exposures were done at PSI and were described in [18].

The leakage currents, \(I_{test}\), and depletion voltages, \(V_{dep}\), of the silicon diodes were monitored before the irradiation and at periodic intervals following irradiation. After several months, the leakage currents (measured at \(V_{dep}\)) were stable and linearly related to the particle fluence [10]. The depletion voltages were determined from CV measurements using a HP4284 A capacitance meter at 10Khz [3]. \(V_{dep}\) was given by the following procedure. The steepest region of the CV data was fit to the form: \(C=a\cdot V^{n}\). The intersection of this line and a constant capacitance characteristic of these diodes gave \(V_{dep}\)[3]. The constant capacitance used was the average measured capacitance of the unirradiated diodes (71.5 pf).

The stability of the \(V_{dep}\) measurements was studied for a range of signal levels between 10mV and 300mV used by the HP4284 A capacitance meter. For a signal-level of 10mV, the automatic calibration of the capacitance meter repeatedly failed. The \(V_{dep}\) measurements at the other signal levels (30mV, 50mV, 100mV, 300mV) were consistent within errors. A signal level of 50mV was used for the measurements in this paper.

To study reverse annealing, 2 diodes from the 1991 proton run and the 15 diodes from the 1992 proton radiation run, were divided into 4 groups. Each group included diodes covering the range of fluences from \(\sim 3\times 10^{13}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}\) to \(\sim 8\times 10^{13}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}\). The groups were then placed in temperature controlled environments at \(\sim 1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\), \(\sim 23^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\), \(35^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\), and \(50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\). The diodes at \(\sim 1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) were stored in a refrigerator with an average value of \(1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) and those at \(\sim 23^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) were stored at laboratory temperature with an average value of \(23^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\); the uncertainty in these temperatures was \(\pm 2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\). The diodes at temperatures warmer than room temperature were in insulated enclosures with temperature controlled resistive heating elements and muffin fans to maintain uniform temperatures; the uncertainty in these temperatures was \(\pm 0.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\).

Approximately one year after the 1992 radiation run, 8 of the silicon diodes were exposed to an additional fluence of \(\sim 3\times 10^{13}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}\). Between the 1992 and 1993 radiation runs, 4 of the diodes were stored at \(\sim 1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) and thus little reverse annealing occurred. In contrast, 4 of the diodes were stored at \(35^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) for 200 days and thus substantial reverse annealing occurred. Before and after the second irradiation exposure these diodes were at room temperature for \(\sim 20\) days. The diodes were then stored at \(\sim 1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) until allowed to reverse anneal at \(50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\).

The silicon diodes from the 1994 proton irradiations were stored at \(\sim 1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) following the irradiation. Measurements at room temperature were then made for a total of \(\sim 17\) days at \(\sim 23^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) before the diodes were allowed to reverse anneal at \(50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\). The silicon diodes from the 1994 \(\pi^{+}\) irradiations were stored at a variety of temperatures following the irradiation; as a consequence only the measurements following full reverse annealing at \(50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) were easily analysed.

As depletion voltage measurements were made at a number of diode temperatures, a study was done to determine the variation of \(V_{dep}\) with silicon temperature. Depletion voltages of irradiated silicon diodes were measured before any significant reverse annealing, \(R(t,t_{1/2})\approx 0\), and also following full reverse annealing, \(R(t,t_{1/2})\approx 1\). The ratio of the depletion voltage at temperature, T, to the value at room temperature, \(V_{dep}(T)/V_{dep}(23^{\rm o}{\rm C})\), was plotted in Fig 1. The error bars on the data points were the RMS errors characteristic of the scatter in the several measurements at each temperature. These errors were typically \(\sim 2\times\) the error calculated from the uncertainty in the individual measurements of \(V_{dep}\). These data were consistent with \(V_{dep}(T)/V_{dep}(23^{\rm o}{\rm C})\approx 0.89\) at \(T\approx 0^{\rm o}{\rm C}\) and \(V_{dep}(T)/V_{dep}(23^{\rm o}{\rm C})\approx 1.22\) at \(T=50^{\rm o}{\rm C}\). A significant temperature dependence on \(V_{dep}\) had been reported for diodes following reverse annealing [19]; for diodes at \(0^{\rm o}{\rm C}\) this study was consistent with this behaviour before reverse annealing.

To convert measurements at different temperatures to a common temperature, \(23^{\rm o}{\rm C}\), the data in Fig. 1 were parameterized by a polynomial in \(\Delta T=T-23^{\rm o}{\rm C}\). The solid line shown in Fig. 1 corresponds to:

\[V_{dep}(T)/V_{dep}(23^{\rm o}C)=1.0\ \ +\ \ 6.50\times 10^{-3}\cdot\Delta T\ \ +\ \ 7.17\times 10^{-5}\cdot\Delta T^{2} \tag{2}\]

This parameterization was used to correct depletion voltage measurements to room temperature (as noted below).

## 3 Results

### Reverse Annealing in Silicon Sensors

The effective dopant concentration (\(N_{eff}\)) of the silicon diodes was obtained from the depletion voltage, \(V_{dep}\), as follows:

\[|N_{eff}|=\frac{2\cdot V_{dep}\cdot\epsilon_{0}\cdot\epsilon_{s}}{e\cdot d_{dep }^{2}} \tag{3}\]

where \(\epsilon_{0}\) was the permittivity of free space, \(\epsilon_{s}\) was the relative dielectric constant of silicon (11.9), \(e\) was the electron charge, and \(d_{dep}\) was the width of the depletion layer (\(\leq 170\mu\)m for the Hamamatsu PIN photodiodes 3). The _sign_ of \(N_{eff}\) was evaluated using a pulsed \(\sim 700\) nm LED to determine whether the n-p junction for the PIN diode was at the front window (as for unirradiated diodes) or had moved to the back of the diode (following silicon type inversion).

The time dependence for \(N_{eff}(\Phi,t)\) from eqn. 1 simplifies in the limit of proton fluences \(\Phi>3\times 10^{13}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}\) to:

\[N_{eff}(\Phi,t)=(N_{eff}(0)-N_{D})\ \ -\ g_{c}\cdot\Phi\ \ -\ g_{Y}\cdot\Phi\cdot R(t,t_{1/2})\]

In this section we extract values for \(N_{eff}(0)-N_{D}\), \(g_{c}\) and \(g_{Y}\) using the time dependence of \(R(t,t_{1/2})\) and the fluence dependence of \(N_{eff}(\Phi,t)\).

The depletion voltage measurements were done for each of the irradiated diodes at regular intervals following irradiation. The timing of the measurements was matched to the time rate of change in \(V_{dep}\) for each diode.

The long term annealing of radiation damaged silicon sensors has been studied as a first order process (\(X\to Y\)) [13]. However, the data were found to be in better agreement with a second order process (\(X_{1}+X_{2}\to Y\)) [12]. In either case electrically inactive defects \(X\) were created by radiation damage. In time these change (1st order) or combine (2nd order) to electrically active defects \(Y\).

For a 2nd order process with \(X_{1}+X_{2}\to Y\) then:

\[dN_{Y}=\ \ k\cdot N_{x1}\cdot N_{x\,2}\cdot dt\]

\[dN_{x1}=dN_{x\,2}=-k\cdot N_{x\,1}\cdot N_{x\,2}\cdot dt\]

where \(k\) is the associated rate constant. For defect densities \(N_{x1}\approx N_{x\,2}\equiv N_{x}\) then:

\[dN_{x}=-k\cdot N_{x}^{2}\cdot dt\]

and the resulting density of active defects, \(N_{Y}(t)\) at time \(t\) is given by:

\[N_{Y}(t) = N_{x}(0)\left[1-\frac{1}{1\ \ +\ \ k\cdot N_{x}(0)\cdot t}\right]\] \[= N_{Y}(\infty)\left[1-\frac{1}{1\ \ +\ \ t/t_{1/2}}\right]=N_{Y}( \infty)\cdot R(t,t_{1/2})\]

where \(t_{1/2}=(k\cdot N_{Y}(\infty))^{-1}\) was the half-life time for reverse annealing and \(N_{Y}(\infty)=N_{x}(0)=g_{Y}\cdot\Phi\) in eqn. 1.

The reverse annealing parameters for the irradiated diodes were obtained from the depletion voltage time history, \(V_{dep}(t)\), of the diodes. Prior to our study of reverse annealing the radiation damaged diodes were stored at \(\sim 1^{\circ}\)C. The diodes for study of reverse annealing were then moved at time \(t=t_{0}\) to a temperature controlled environment (described above). The \(V_{dep}\) measurements were then continued for an elapsed time \((t-t_{0})>>t_{1/2}\).

To extract reverse annealing parameters the \(V_{dep}(t)\), or equivalently \(|N_{eff}(t)|\), data for each silicon diode were analysed with the functional form:

\[|N_{eff}(t)| = N_{c}\quad(t<t_{0}) \tag{4}\] \[= N_{c}+N_{Y}(\infty)\left[1-\frac{1}{1\ \ +\ \ (t-t_{0})/t_{1/2}} \right]\quad(t\geq t_{0}) \tag{5}\]

where \(N_{c}\) was the effective dopant density before reverse annealing. An example of \(V_{dep}(t)\) for a typical diode is shown in Fig. 2; the superimposed curve was a fit to the form of eqns. 4,5.

The fit results provide measurements of \(N_{c}\), \(N_{Y}(\infty)\), and \(t_{1/2}\). In general some reverse annealing had occurred prior to \(t_{0}\)4 and was recognized in the analyses that follow.

Footnote 4: Thus for example the _fit_ quantity \(N_{Y}(\infty)\leq g_{Y}\cdot\Phi\).

**3.1.a**_Rate constant for Reverse Annealing_

The reverse annealing results from each group of diodes, stored at the same fixed temperature \(T\), were used to measure the temperature dependence of the rate constant, \(k(T)\):

\[k(T)=1/(N_{Y}(\infty)\cdot t_{1/2}) \tag{6}\]

The rate constants evaluated from \(\pi^{+}\) or proton irradiated diodes were consistent and were combined in this study. In practice eqn. 6 was used only for reverse annealing at temperatures \(T\geq 23^{\circ}\)C. To measure \(k(T=1^{\circ}C)\) only diodes that were stored at \(T\approx 1^{\circ}\)C for the full time following irradiation were used. Following short term annealing and for times \(t<<t_{1/2}\), then \(N_{eff}(t)\) was approximately linear in time:

\[|N_{eff}(t)|=N_{c}\ \ +\ \ \ \frac{dN/dt\cdot t}{(1+\frac{dN/dt\cdot t}{N_{Y}( \infty)})} \tag{7}\]

\[\simeq N_{c}\ \ +\ \ dN/dt\cdot t\]

where the slope (eqn. 7) was given by \(dN/dt=k(T=1^{\circ}C)\cdot N_{Y}(\infty)^{2}\), \(N_{Y}(\infty)=g_{Y}\cdot\Phi\), and the small correction in the denominator was evaluated as \((dN/dt\cdot t)\) / \((g_{Y}\cdot\Phi)\). The "linear" dependence with time was evident in Fig. 3. The rate constant \(k(T=1^{\circ}C)\) was evaluated from the slope taking \(g_{Y}\) from Sect. 3.1.b below.

All of the measurements of \(k(T)\) were combined in Fig. 4. In this figure Ln(\(k(T)\)) was plotted as a function of \(1/T\). A linear relation was expected if the rate constant followed an Arrhenius relation:

\[k(T)=k_{0}\cdot e^{-E_{a}/(k_{B}\cdot T)}\]

where \(k_{B}\) was Boltzmann's constant, and \(k_{0}\) and \(E_{a}\) were related to the silicon lattice and the activation energy respectively [12]. In Fig. 4 the measurements at each temperature have been averaged. The plotted errors were the RMS deviations of the Ln(_k(T)_) values. A fit to the data assuming the Arrhenius relation gave:

\[k_{0}=0.85^{+25}_{-0.8\,2}cm^{3}/s\]

and

\[E_{a}=1.16\pm 0.08eV\]

or normalizing to \(T=0^{\circ}C\):

\[k(T)=k(T=0^{\circ}C)\cdot e^{-E_{a}/k_{B}\cdot(1/T-1/273.2)}\]

gave:

\[k(T=0^{\circ}C)=3.4^{+1.3}_{-1.0}\times 10^{-22}cm^{3}/s\]

The result for \(k(T=0^{\circ}C)\) was consistent with previous determinations [2,12,15]. The result for \(E_{a}\) was \(\sim 2\) standard deviations below previous measurements [12].

#### 3.1.b Fluence dependence of radiation damage

The effective silicon dopant, \(N_{eff}(\Phi,t)\) in eqn. 1, simplifies in the limit of proton fluences \(\Phi>3\times 10^{13}/\)cm\({}^{2}\) and short times to:

\[N_{min}(\Phi)\equiv N_{eff}(\Phi,t<<t_{1/2})=(N_{eff}(0)-N_{D})\ \ \ -\ \ g_{c}\cdot\Phi \tag{8}\]

and at long times to:

\[N_{max}(\Phi)\equiv N_{eff}(\Phi,t>>t_{1/2})=(N_{eff}(0)-N_{D})\ \ \ -\ \ (g_{c}+g_{Y})\cdot\Phi \tag{9}\]

Both \(N_{min}(\Phi)\) and \(N_{max}(\Phi)\) were predicted to vary linearly with fluence, and provide a clean measurement of \(N_{eff}(0)-N_{D}\), \(g_{c}\) and \(g_{Y}\).

The \(\pi^{+}\) irradiation results for \(N_{max}(\Phi)\) and the proton irradiation results for \(N_{min}(\Phi)\) and \(N_{max}(\Phi)\) are plotted in Fig. 5; strictly speaking these were absolute values of the effective dopant concentrations. Values for \(N_{max}(\Phi)\) were obtained both from fits to the reverse annealing data, see for example Fig. 2, and from measurements of the \(V_{dep}\) after reverse annealing was complete (\(t>>t_{1/2}\)). Values for \(N_{min}(\Phi)\) were obtained only for diodes stored always at \(\sim 1^{\circ}C\), see for example Fig. 3. Measurements taken at temperatures different from room temperature were scaled to room temperature using eqn 2.

Fits to the proton \(N_{min}(\Phi)\) results, Fig. 5, following eqn. 8 gave:

\[N_{eff}(0)-N_{D}=0.73^{+0.75}_{-0.75}\times 10^{11}/cm^{3}\]

and

\[g_{c}^{pr\,at\,on}=1.19^{+0.15}_{-0.15}\times 10^{-2}/cm\]

The _sign_ for \(N_{eff}(0)-N_{D}\) is consistent with the convention in this paper (see eqn s. 1 and 8).

Because \(N_{eff}(0)-N_{D}\approx 0\), a small but significant contribution from the initial donor concentration to the \(N_{min}(\Phi)\) data can be corrected for by comparing these data to the functional form:

\[N_{min}(\Phi)=(N_{eff}(0)-N_{D})\ \ +\ \ \ N_{eff}(0)\cdot e^{-c\Phi}\ \ -\ g_{c}\cdot\Phi\]

where \(c^{proton}=0.96\times 10^{-13}\) cm\({}^{2}\)[15]. Using this form we obtain:

\[N_{eff}(0)-N_{D}=0.35^{+0.75}_{-0.75}\times 10^{11}/cm^{3}\]

and

\[g_{c}^{pr\,at\,on}=1.14^{+0.15}_{-0.15}\times 10^{-2}/cm\]

Finally if we assume that \((N_{eff}(0)-N_{D})=0\) then:

\[N_{min}(\Phi)=N_{eff}(0)\cdot e^{-c\Phi}\ \ -\ g_{c}\cdot\Phi\]

and the comparison to the \(N_{min}(\Phi)\) data gave:

\[g_{c}^{pr\,at\,on}=1.08^{+0.15}_{-0.15}\times 10^{-2}/cm\]

where the error has been taken from the fits (above) with \(N_{eff}(0)-N_{D}\) unconstrained.

The analyses of the \(N_{min}(\Phi)\) data, where \(t>>T_{1/2}\), had a small sensitivity to values of \((N_{eff}(0)-N_{D})\) near zero. In quoting results we set \((N_{eff}(0)-N_{D})=0.35\times 10^{11}/cm^{3}\) based on the \(N_{min}(\Phi)\) data. Thus following short term annealingthe effective dopant for the Hamamatsu spin diodes was parameterized by 5:

Footnote 5: Where we used \(c^{pr\,ot\,on}=0.96\times 10^{-13}\) cm\({}^{2}\) or \(c^{\pi^{+}}=1.64\times 10^{-13}\) cm\({}^{2}\)[15] as appropriate, and \(N_{eff}(0)\) for the Hamamatsu PIN diodes was in the range \(7\times 10^{11}/\)cm\({}^{3}\) to \(9\times 10^{11}/\)cm\({}^{3}\).

\[N_{eff}(\Phi,t)=0.35\times 10^{11}/cm^{3}+N_{eff}(0)e^{-\epsilon\Phi}-g_{c} \cdot\Phi-g_{Y}\cdot\Phi\cdot R(t,t_{1/2}) \tag{10}\]

Fits to the proton \(N_{m\,ax}(\Phi)\) measurement s gave:

\[(g_{c}+g_{Y})^{pr\,ot\,on}=6.11^{+0.18}_{-0.18}\times 10^{-2}/cm\]

The uncertainty for \(g_{c}+g_{Y}\) was scaled up by a factor of 2 to include the systematic difference between results for \(g_{c}+g_{Y}\) using \(N_{m\,ax}\) from _reverse annealing fits_ (denoted (x) in Fig. 5), or using \(N_{m\,ax}\) from \(V_{dep}\)_measurements following full reverse annealing_ (denoted (o) in Fig. 5), and to reflect the uncertainty in \((N_{\epsilon\,ff}(0)-N_{D})\). Solving for \(g_{Y}\) gave:

\[g_{Y}^{pr\,ot\,on}=4.97^{+0.23}_{-0.23}\times 10^{-2}/cm\]

The results for \(g_{c}^{proton}\) were in agreement with previous measurements [15]. The result for \(g_{Y}^{pr\,ot\,on}\) was \(\sim 2\) standard deviations below previous measurements [15].

For \(\pi^{+}\) fluences \(\Phi>2\times 10^{13}/\)cm\({}^{2}\) a comparison of eqn. 10 to the \(\pi^{+}\) measurements for \(N_{m\,ax}\) gave:

\[(g_{c}+g_{Y})^{\pi^{+}}=8.81^{+0.43}_{-0.43}\times 10^{-2}/cm\]

This was \(\sim 2\) standard deviations below previous measurements [15].

### Effective dopant dependence following multiple irradiations

Approximately one year after the 1992 LAMPF radiation run, 8 of the silicon diodes were exposed to an additional fluence of \(2.8\times 10^{13}/\)cm\({}^{2}\) at TRIUMF. By this time one of the diodes had a depletion voltage \(>100\) volts and could not be reliably measured. The time history of the \(V_{dep}\) for the remaining 7 diodes was plotted in Fig 6a,b. Between the 1992 and 1993 radiation runs, 4 of the diodes were stored at \(\sim 1^{\circ}\)C. As seen in Fig. 6a, little reverse annealing occurred during this time. In contrast, 3 of the diodes were stored at 35\({}^{\circ}\)C for 200 days. As seen in Fig. 6b, substantial reverse annealing had occurred. Before and after the second irradiation these diodes were at room temperature for \(\sim 20\) days. The diodes were then stored at \(\sim 1^{\circ}\)C until allowed to reverse anneal at 50\({}^{\circ}\)C (off scale in Fig 6a,b).

A visual inspection of Fig. 6a,b showed that in all cases \(V_{dep}\) increased between the time just before the 2nd irradiation and just following the 2nd irradiation. Toobtain a quantitative measure of the change in depletion voltage \(\delta V_{dep}\) was evaluated for each diode, where:

\[\delta V_{dep}^{corrected}=(V_{dep}(t_{after})-V_{dep}(t_{before}))\ \ \ -\ \ \delta V_{dep}^{m\,odel}\]

In this expression \(t_{after}\) and \(t_{before}\) corresponded to the dates of depletion measurements made just before and just after the 2nd irradiation, and \(\delta V_{dep}^{m\,odel}\) corrected for the expected reverse annealing from the 1st proton fluence during the \(\sim 20\) days at a nominal \(23^{\circ}\)C 6. Average values of \(\delta V_{dep}\) were determined separately for the 4 diodes with their first reverse annealing at \(1^{\circ}\)C and for the 3 diodes with first reverse annealing at \(35^{\circ}\)C. Without the \(\delta V_{dep}^{m\,odel}\) correction, the \(\delta V_{dep}\) measurements in Fig. 7 would be increased by \(\sim 2.9V\) or by \(\sim 0.1V\) for diodes initially at \(1^{\circ}\)C or \(35^{\circ}\)C respectively. The \(\delta V_{dep}^{corrected}\) values were in agreement with the predicted range shown by the dashed curves in Fig. 7.

Footnote 6: The model was a simple extension of eqn. 10. Specifically the term \(g_{Y}\cdot\Phi\cdot R(t,t_{1/2})\), integrated numerically, in duded the time history of the fluences and of the annealing.

In summary the observed change in \(V_{dep}\) from the 2nd irradiation was fully consistent with a simple _additive fluence_ model of bulk radiation damage combined with reverse annealing. Parenthetically, values for \(N_{m\,ax}\) in Fig. 5 included measurements for \(\Phi_{total}=\Phi_{1}+\Phi_{2}\), where \(\Phi_{1}\) was the proton fluence from the 1992 LAMPF run and \(\Phi_{2}\)was the additional proton fluence from the 1993 TRIUMF run.

### Radiation damage at fluences below \(2\times 10^{13}\)/cm\({}^{2}\)

Data were taken with \(\pi^{+}\) fluences as low as \(\sim 0.4\times 10^{13}\)/cm\({}^{2}\) and with proton fluences in the range of \(\sim 0.1\times 10^{13}\)/cm\({}^{2}\) to \(\sim 0.6\times 10^{13}\)/cm\({}^{2}\). These data permitted a study of reverse annealing to fluences below silicon type inversion. In addition the data provided an opportunity to check the simple model, eqn. 10, down to low fluences.

A plot of the depletion voltage for these diodes following reverse annealing is given in Fig. 8. The curves in the figure correspond to eqn. 10 for \(t>>t_{1/2}\):

\[N_{eff}(\Phi,t=\infty)=N_{eff}(0)e^{-c\Phi}-(g_{c}+g_{Y})\cdot\Phi \tag{11}\]

with \(c=0.96\times 10^{-13}\) cm\({}^{2}\) for proton data and \(c=1.64\times 10^{-13}\) cm\({}^{2}\) for \(\pi^{+}\) data from Ref. [15]. Values for \(g_{c}+g_{Y}\) were from Sect. 3.1.b above. This simple parameterization was in agreement with the data for the entire range of fluences. Thus following reverse annealing type inversion occurs for \(\pi^{+}\) fluences of \(0.4-0.5\times 10^{13}\)/cm\({}^{2}\) and for proton fluences of \(0.6-0.7\times 10^{13}\)/cm\({}^{2}\).

Although the displacement cross sections for \(\pi^{+}\) or protons differ and are energy dependent [20], much of the final bulk damage in silicon sensors from high energy particles could be conjectured to result from similar damage process to the silicon crystal structure. Thus it is plausible to expect that a simple empirical relationship would exist between the \(\pi^{+}\) and proton bulk damage (and leakage current) constants; namely that the bulk damage from \(\pi^{+}\approx\)_proton_ bulk damage in silicon sensors at the same leakage current density. A test of this conjecture is given by the dash-dot curve in Fig. 8 where the curve is the simple extension of eqn. 11:

\[N_{eff}^{\pi^{+}}(\Phi,t=\infty)=N_{\epsilon\,ff}(0)e^{-\phi^{proton}\Phi^{!}}- \left(g_{c}+g_{Y}\right)^{pr\,ot\,on}\Phi^{\prime}\]

with:

\[\Phi^{\prime}=\Phi\cdot\alpha_{\infty}^{\pi^{+}}/\alpha_{\infty}^{pr\,ot\,on} \approx \Phi\cdot\left(g_{c}+g_{Y}\right)^{\pi^{+}}/\left(g_{c}+g_{Y} \right)^{pr\,ot\,on}\]

where \(c^{proton}\) and \(\left(g_{c}+g_{Y}\right)^{pr\,ot\,on}\) were the proton damage constants, and \(\left(g_{c}+g_{Y}\right)^{\pi^{+}}/\left(g_{c}+g_{Y}\right)^{proton}=1.44\pm 0.09\) (Sect. 3.1.b). This was consistent with our determination of \(\alpha_{\infty}^{\pi^{+}}/\alpha_{\infty}^{proton}=1.29\pm 0.40\). Our measurement of the pion and proton leakage current damage coefficients following annealing were \(\alpha_{\infty}^{\pi^{+}}=4.0_{-1.}^{+1.}\times 10^{-17}\)A/cm, in agreement with Ref. [21], and \(\alpha_{\infty}^{proton}=3.1_{-0.6}^{+0.6}\times 10^{-17}\)A/cm, in agreement with Ref. [10].

## 4 Implications for Semi-Conductor Tracker in ATLAS

As noted above, bulk radiation damage to silicon sensors results in changes in the effective silicon dopant concentration, \(N_{eff}\). Changes in \(N_{eff}\) are related to changes in the sensor depletion voltage, \(V_{dep}\), as shown in eqn. 3. The changes in \(N_{eff}\) depend on the magnitude and type of radiation fluence, \(\Phi\), and on the time, t, history of the radiation and the silicon temperature, T. Following short term annealing, we found that the effective dopant concentration in the irradiated silicon diodes was consistent with the parameterization:

\[N_{eff}(\Phi,t)=N_{eff}(0)e^{-c\Phi}-g_{c}\cdot\Phi-g_{Y}\cdot\Phi\cdot R(t,t_{ 1/2})\]

where \(N_{eff}(0)\) was the initial concentration of donor plus acceptor impurities, \(g_{c}\) and \(g_{Y}\) parameterized the creation of stable and time dependent defects respectively, \(R(t,t_{1/2})\) parameterized reverse annealing, and \(t_{1/2}\) depended on the silicon temperature and the fluence.

An additional _short term annealing_ component of bulk damage was studied in a previous analysis [13]. This component of bulk damage decreased exponentially with time with a temperature dependent time constant, \(\tau\). Although \(\tau\) was \(\sim 1\) day at room temperature, it was \(\sim 70\) days at \(0^{\circ}\)C. Thus only silicon sensors irradiated and stored _cold_ showed this component of radiation damage; see for example the time history of diodes stored at \(\sim 1^{\circ}\)C, Fig. 2 and 3.

To simulate the depletion voltage for pixel and silicon strip layers in the ATLAS Semi-Conductor Tracker (SCT) we have included both the short and the long term components of bulk damage as well as a model for the possible time history of the sensors' temperature and of the particle fluence. The model assumed a yearly history for LHC luminosity and SCT sensor temperatures as follows [22]:

* 100 days at constant luminosity at sensor (silicon) temperature, \(T_{op}\),
* 50 days at 0 luminosity at sensor temperature, \(T_{op}\),
* 1-7 days at 0 luminosity at sensor temperature of \(20^{\circ}\)C,
* 214-208 days at 0 luminosity at sensor temperature, \(T_{op}\).

Two values were assumed for the silicon sensor temperature, \(T_{op}\), to bracket possible operating temperatures: \(T_{op}=-20^{\circ}\)C or \(T_{op}=-10^{\circ}\)C. The average LHC luminosity was assumed to be \(10^{33}/cm^{2}/se\epsilon\) for the first three years and then \(10^{34}/cm^{2}/se\epsilon\) for the following seven years. The total particle fluence after 10 years was assumed to be \(6\times 10^{14}/cm^{2}\) for the innermost pixel layer and \(1\times 10^{14}/cm^{2}\) for the innermost siliconstrip layer [2]. Estimates of radiation damage were made assuming the particle fluence was \(\pi^{+}\) or protons. The silicon damage coefficients were taken from Sect. 3.1 above.

The simulation numerically integrated the time dependence of \(N_{eff}\), from the particle fluence and silicon annealing, based on the following model for the time dependence of \(N_{eff}\) following an instantaneous fluence, \(\Phi\), at time \(t=0\) and for sensors at a fixed temperature, T:

\[N_{eff}(\Phi,t,T)=N_{eff}(0)e^{-c\Phi}-g_{s}\cdot\Phi\cdot e^{-t/\tau(T)}-g_{c} \cdot\Phi-g_{Y}\cdot\Phi\cdot R(t,t_{1/2}(\Phi,T))\]

using:

* \(c=0.96\times 10^{-13}\) cm\({}^{2}\)[15],
* \(g_{s}=1.93\times 10^{-2}/cm\) and \(\tau=70\cdot e^{-0.175\cdot T(^{8}C)}\) days [13],
* \(g_{c}\), \(g_{Y}\), and \(R(t,t_{1/2})\) from Sect. 3.1 above, and
* where for \(\pi^{+}\) the fluence was scaled (up) by the factor \((g_{c}+g_{Y})^{\pi^{+}}/(g_{c}+g_{Y})^{m\sigma\,t\sigma\,t\sigma}=1.44\) to approximate bulk damage from (300 MeV/c) pions (see Sect 3.3) to provide a conservative (worst case) damage estimate.

The proton and \(\pi^{+}\) simulation results for the innermost silicon strip layer in SCT are given in Fig. 9a and b respectively assuming \(T_{op}=-10^{0}\)C and 7 days/year at \(20^{0}\)C) (following [22]). The predicted depletion voltages have _not_ been corrected to the sensor operating temperature. For operating temperatures below \(0^{0}\)C this would reduce \(V_{dep}\) by \(\geq 11\%\) based on eqn. 2. The proton simulation predicted maximum depletion voltages of \(\sim 120\) volts; the \(\pi^{+}\) simulation predicted maximum depletion voltages of \(\sim 180\) volts. If we assume an overvolt age of \(\sim 50\) volts, needed for the efficient collection of charge and to minimize the noise (capacitance) on p-implant strips, then operating voltages in excess of 170 volts were predicted for the innermost silicon strip sensors before the end of 10 years. At these voltages double sided AC coupled silicon strip sensors have exhibited micro-discharge breakdown [23]. This leads to increased noise and possibly sensor failure.

The \(\pi^{+}\) simulation results for the innermost silicon strip layer in SCT were repeated in Fig. 9c and d assuming a reduction in the number of days/year at \(20^{0}\)C or in the sensor operating temperature respectively. The increase in the silicon strip depletion voltages with time was the least for \(T_{op}=-10^{0}\)C and l day/year at \(20^{0}\)C, Fig. 9c, but was not substantially better than the other two cases (Fig. 9b or 9d). Although the total depletion voltage was rather stable for the cases presented in Fig.

9b-d, the contributions to \(V_{dep}\) were very different. For example the contribution from the _short term annealing_ term was large in detectors operated at \(T_{op}=-20^{\circ}\)C and warmed up for only 1 day/year, Fig. 9d, but the contribution from the _reverse annealing_ term was very small. In contrast the contribution from the _short term annealing_ term was small in detectors operated at \(T_{op}=-10^{\circ}\)C and warmed up for 7 day s/year, Fig. 9b, but the contribution from the _reverse annealing_ term was large. Thus the interplay of short term annealing and reverse annealing resulted in a range of operating temperatures and warm-up scenarios with similar predictions for \(V_{dep}\) with time.

The optimization of \(T_{op}\) and the number of days/year at \(20^{\circ}\)C may be anticipated to be different for the innermost pixel layer than for the innermost silicon strip layer. As seen in the silicon strip example, decreases in \(V_{dep}\) from beneficial annealing need to be balanced against increases in \(V_{dep}\) from reverse annealing. Beneficial annealing depends exponentially on the sensor (silicon) temperature [13]. In contrast, reverse annealing depends exponentially on the sensor (silicon) temperature _and_ on the un-annealed fluence; see Sect. 3 above. At cold operating temperatures reverse annealing is suppressed and thus to a first approximation the rate for reverse annealing:

\[dN_{Y}\approx k\cdot(g_{Y}\cdot\Phi)^{2}\cdot dt\]

is \(\propto\Phi^{2}\). In contrast beneficial annealing is \(\propto\Phi\). Thus the balance between beneficial and reverse annealing may be significantly different for the inner pixel layer, where the fluence is a factor of 6\(\times\) greater, than in the inner silicon strip layer.

To study the sensitivity of the \(V_{dep}\) for the inner pixel layer on \(T_{op}\) and on the number of days/year at \(20^{\circ}\)C, simulations were done varying \(T_{op}\) (values of \(-10^{\circ}\)C or \(-20^{\circ}\)C ) and varying the number of days/year at \(20^{\circ}\)C (values of 1 day or 7 days). In all simulations pixel depletion voltages were evaluated for \(150\mu\)m depletion depths; to scale to other depths use eqn. 3. The simulation results based on assuming the \(\pi^{+}\) damage coefficients are given in Fig. 10a-d. The predicted depletion voltages are significantly higher for both cases with 7 day s/year at \(20^{\circ}\)C. The simulations with 1 day/year at \(20^{\circ}\)C predict similar values for \(V_{dep}\) for \(T_{op}\) of \(-10^{\circ}\)C or \(-20^{\circ}\)C. Thus a common pixel and silicon strip [22] operating temperature of \(\sim-10^{\circ}\)C appears reasonable. However for the pixel system the number of _warm_ days/year must be strictly limited to minimize the depletion voltage for the innermost pixel layer. This places stringent constraints on reliability of the temperature control system for the SCT.

Finally, Figs. 11a and b show the predicted pixel depletion voltage assuming proton damage coefficients, \(T_{op}=-10^{\circ}\)C, and 7 days/year or 1 day/year at \(20^{\circ}\)C respectively. These simulations also predicted significantly smaller values for pixel \(V_{dep}\) for 1 day/year at \(20^{\circ}\)C than 7 days/year.

In summary an operating temperature of \(\thicksim-10^{\circ}\)C is consistent with minimizing the depletion voltages in both pixel and silicon strip sensors in the SCT. However, for the (innermost) pixel layers, the number of days/year at elevated temperatures, \(\thicksim 20^{\circ}\)C, must be limited to approximately 1 day. All operating scenarios for the innermost layer of silicon strip detectors predicted operating voltages \(>170\) volts before the end of 10 years. This may be a problem for double sided AC coupled sensors.

## 5 Summary

Radiation bulk damage in high resistivity n-type silicon was studied for \(\pi^{+}\) and proton irradiations to fluences similar to those expected in future Tevatron and LHC experiments.

Following short term annealing, the effective dopant concentration in the irradiated silicon diodes was consistent with the functional form:

\[N_{eff}(\Phi,t)=N_{eff}(0)e^{-c\Phi}-g_{c}\cdot\Phi-g_{Y}\cdot\Phi\cdot R(t,t_{ 1/2})\]

where \(N_{eff}(0)\) was the initial concentration of donor plus acceptor impurities, \(g_{c}\) and \(g_{Y}\) parameterized the creation of stable and time dependent defects respectively, \(R(t,t_{1/2})\) parameterized reverse annealing, and \(t_{1/2}\) depended on the silicon temperature and the fluence.

Silicon diodes exposed to fluences of 500-800 MeV (1.09-1.46 GeV/c momentum) protons were used to measure:

\[g_{c}^{pr\,ot\,on}=1.14^{+0.15}_{-0.15}\times 10^{-2}/cm\]

and

\[(g_{c}+g_{Y})^{pr\,ot\,on}=6.11^{+0.18}_{-0.18}\times 10^{-2}/cm\]

and diodes exposed to fluences of 190 MeV (300 MeV/c momentum) \(\pi^{+}\) were used to measure:

\[(g_{c}+g_{Y})^{\pi^{+}}=8.81^{+0.43}_{-0.43}\times 10^{-2}/cm\]

Determinations of the rate constant for reverse annealing were consistent with the Arrhenius relation:

\[k(T)=k_{0}\cdot e^{-E_{a}/(k_{B}\cdot T)}\]

where:

\[k_{0}=0.85^{+25}_{-0.82}cm^{3}/s\]and

\[E_{a}=1.16\pm 0.08eV\]

Measurements were corrected to room temperature, \(T=23^{o}\)C, using an empirical parameterization of the effective donor concentration, \(N_{eff}\), with temperature. This correction varied from \(+11\,\%\) at \(0^{o}\)C to \(-22\%\) at \(50^{o}\)C.

8 silicon diodes were exposed to a second proton fluence of \(\sim 3\times 10^{13}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}\). The resulting changes in \(N_{eff}\) were consistent with an additive fluence model of bulk radiation damage combined with reverse annealing.

The conjecture that a common description can be obtained of the effective dopant density, \(N_{eff}(\Phi,t)\), in high resistivity n-type silicon sensors by _scaling_\(\pi^{+}\) and proton fluences to the same leakage current density was consistent with the bulk damage data.

The simulation of the innermost pixel and silicon microstrip layers in the ATLAS SCT was consistent with an operating temperature of \(\sim-10^{o}\)C to minimize the depletion voltages in both pixel and silicon strip sensors. However, for the (inermost) pixel layers, the number of days/year at elevated temperatures, \(\sim 20^{o}\)C, must be limited to approximately 1 day. All operating scenarios for silicon strip detectors predicted operating voltages \(>170\) volts before the end of 10 years. This may be a problem for double sided AC coupled sensors.
