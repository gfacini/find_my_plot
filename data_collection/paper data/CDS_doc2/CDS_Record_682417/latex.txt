## 1 Introduction

ATLAS is a detector primarily optimised for high-luminosity LHC physics. However, B physics is influencing the design. Examples of this are a muon trigger that has good efficiency and a sharp threshold at relatively low transverse momentum (\(p_{\rm T}\)\(\simeq\) 6 GeV), a Transition-Radiation Tracker (TRT) that can identify electrons down to \(p_{\rm T}\)\(\simeq\) 1 GeV, and high-precision vertex detectors at low radius from the beam line.

ATLAS, using the LHC in collider mode, benefits from the highest available LHC centre-of-mass energy, \(\sqrt[]{s}\) = 14 TeV. At this energy the cross-section for beauty production is high (\(\sigma\)(b\(\bar{\rm b}\)) \(\simeq\) 500 \(\mu\)b) and the signal-to-background conditions are much more favourable compared to lower energies: \(\sigma\)(b\(\bar{\rm b}\))/\(\sigma\)(tot) \(\simeq\) 1%. An added advantage is that at such high energy and for the central collisions within the ATLAS acceptance one expects a rather small production asymmetry, at the per-cent level.

Much of the B physics in ATLAS will be done in the first years of operation of LHC at relatively low luminosity, \(L\)\(\simeq\) 1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{33}\) cm-2s-1. Under these conditions, the average number of events per bunch crossing is about two, and pileup is not a major consideration. Nevertheless, the ATLAS detector is capable of doing B physics at much higher luminosity, as discussed later in this paper.

The first-level trigger for B physics in ATLAS is an inclusive muon selection with \(p_{\rm T}\)\(>\) 6 GeV and pseudo-rapidity, \(|\eta|\)\(<\) 1.6. This rather limited pseudo-rapidity acceptance corresponds to a stage-one detector, under the conservative assumption that for financial reasons the forward-muon toroid magnets and trigger systems will not initially be installed. The first-level muon trigger gives a rate of about 10 kHz after allowing for background (mainly from decays in flight of pions and kaons) and the \(p_{\rm T}\) resolution; unless stated otherwise, all rates are given for a luminosity \(L\)\(\simeq\) 1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{33}\) cm-2s-1. It is worth noting that about 40% of the events selected by this trigger are from b\(\bar{\rm b}\) production.

To illustrate the very large sample size in principle possible with LHC, making a sharp cut \(p_{\rm T}\)\(>\) 6 GeV on the inclusive muons with \(|\eta|\)\(<\) 1.6 corresponds to a cross-section of about 1.7 \(\mu\)b or about 1.7 \(\times\) 10\({}^{10}\) b\(\bar{\rm b}\) events per year (allowing for the likely running schedule and efficiency, a year is taken as 10\({}^{7}\) s). In practise, further selection of events will be performed on-line in the second and third-level triggers. These will search for specific final states as discussed later.

ATLAS aims to perform a wide programme of B-physics studies. These include the search for and measurement of CP-violation through the decays \({\rm B^{0}_{d}}\)\(\rightarrow\)\({\rm J}\)/\(\psi{\rm K^{0}_{S}}\), \({\rm B^{0}_{d}}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) and \({\rm B^{0}_{s}}\)J/\(\nu\)\(\phi\), and an attempt to make a time-dependent measurement of \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\)\(\rm\bar{B}^{0}_{s}\)\(\rm\bar{B}^{0}_{s}\)\(\rm mixing\). In such processes the flavour of the \(\rm B^{0}\) that was produced is "tagged" by the charge of the lepton from the semileptonic decay of the other \(\rm b\)-quark in the event. This tag lepton may also provide the first-level muon trigger.

This paper concentrates on the experimental aspects of B-physics studies in ATLAS. The phenomenology is discussed extensively in Ref. [1].

## 2 ATLAS Detector and Trigger for B Physics

The ATLAS detector [2] is illustrated in Figure 1. A distinguishing feature is its large superconducting air-core toroid muon spectrometer. The use of an air-core toroid magnet (as opposed to an iron-core one) makes possible relatively sharp trigger thresholds using only information from the external muon system. Furthermore, muons can be identified down to low transverse momenta, \(p_{\rm T}\) = 5 GeV in the barrel and even lower in the endcaps. Of course, the primary motivation for the air-core toroid spectrometer is its excellent "stand-alone" performance for muon measurement at very high \(p_{\rm T}\), but this is not relevant for B physics studies.

The first-level muon trigger [3] is based on dedicated trigger detectors such as Resistive Plate Chambers and Thin Gap Chambers with a very fast response time, capable of uniquely identifying the bunch crossing of interest. Four layers of trigger chambers with two-coordinate readout are located near the midpoint of the barrel toroid, arranged in two groups of two chambers separated by about 40 cm. For B-physics studies performed at low luminosity, a coincidence between the two groups of chambers is made within a road, the width of the road being chosen to have 90% efficiency for \(p_{\rm T}\) > 6 GeV muons. Hits are required in three out of the four chamber layers in each of the two projections, giving good trigger efficiency. At higher luminosity, three additional trigger chamber layers located after the toroid will be included in the trigger, giving a relatively sharp threshold at \(p_{\rm T}\) \(\approx\) 20 GeV for the single muon trigger and excellent rejection against fake tracks from random hits. It should be possible to operate multi-muon triggers with low trigger thresholds even at high luminosity.

Inside the air-core muon spectrometer is the calorimeter system. The barrel hadronic calorimeter is of the iron - scintillator tile type, using a geometry in which the scintillator plates are oriented parallel to the direction of flight of the particles. The possibility of identifying muons of \(p_{\rm T}\) > 3 GeV with this calorimeter is under investigation. The endcap hadronic calorimeter uses liquid-argon as the sampling medium because of the good radiation hardness capabilities of this technology. The electromagnetic calorimeters are of the lead - liquid argon type using the Accordion geometry. A preshower position detector is placed at the front of the electromagnetic calorimeter.

The inner tracking detector of ATLAS is located in a 2 T solenoidal magnetic field provided by a superconducting coil that sits in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter. Although the detailed layout of the ATLAS tracker is still being optimised, the basic principles are decided.

The outer part of the tracking detector consists of straw tubes, providing typically more than 35 points per track with a single hit resolution of about 170 \(\upmu\)m. Because the large number of hits are spread out over the radial distance from \(r\approx 60\) cm to \(r\approx 105\) cm, this is sometimes referred to as "continuous" tracking. This detector provides very robust pattern recognition for track

Figure 1: Illustration of the ATLAS detector.

finding - tracks are easily visible by eye on an event display, even in the presence of pileup at high luminosity as shown in Figure 2 for \(L=5\times 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{\text{-}2}\)s\({}^{\text{-}1}\).

The straw tracker includes a transition-radiation (TR) radiator and TR hits are identified by high-threshold electronics. The TR signature can be used to separate electrons from hadrons down to momenta as low as 1 GeV; a separation of 30:1 has been measured for a prototype detector for an electron efficiency of 90% [4]. This electron-identification capability in ATLAS is very important for B physics, particularly in the decay channel \(\text{B}_{\text{d}}^{0}\rightarrow\text{J/}\psi\text{ K}_{\text{S}}^{0}\) which is relevant for CP violation studies. Decays of the \(\text{J/}\psi\) to electrons can be identified at low \(p_{\text{T}}\) in the second-level trigger, adding to the statistics collected with \(\text{ J/}\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays which cannot be identified with such low \(p_{\text{T}}\) leptons. Furthermore, for events with a \(\text{J/}\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decay where one of the muons passed the first-level muon trigger, a high-\(p_{\text{T}}\) electron (e.g. \(p_{\text{T}}\) > 6 GeV) can provide the "tag" that identifies whether a \(\text{B}_{\text{d}}^{0}\) or a \(\text{B}_{\text{d}}^{0}\) was produced. This further improves the sample size and gives an important control of experimental systematic errors related to the muon tag.

The continuous tracking at large radius is complemented in the barrel region by a precision semiconductor tracker (SCT) for improved momentum measurement. The SCT, which includes a precision layer at \(r=6\) cm, also provides high-resolution secondary-vertex and impact-parameter measurement. The acceptance of this "B-physics layer" corresponds to about \(|\eta|<2\) and the intrinsic resolution is \(\sigma(r\text{-}\phi)=10\)\(\mu\)m and \(\sigma(r\text{-}z)=20\)\(\mu\)m. At larger radii are a pixel layer at \(r=11.5\) cm with resolution \(\sigma(r\text{-}\phi)=15\)\(\mu\)m and \(\sigma(r\text{-}z)=90\)\(\mu\)m, and silicon microstrip detectors at \(r=20\), \(30\), \(40\), \(50\) and \(60\) cm with a resolution \(\sigma(r\text{-}\phi)\approx 25\)\(\mu\)m.

It is recognised that the "B-physics layer" at \(r=6\) cm will suffer radiation damage. However, it has been estimated [5] that it can survive the equivalent of six years operation at \(L\approx 1\times 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{\text{-}2}\)s\({}^{\text{-}1}\) which is sufficient to complete a substantial B-physics programme. Furthermore, given the small surface area of the detector, its cost is relatively modest, and one can consider replacing it periodically.

In the forward region, the precision tracking is provided by micro-strip gas chambers (MSGCs) arranged in wheels. At small radii, relatively close to the interaction point, GaAs semiconductor detectors are considered because of their resistance against radiation damage. The MSGCs are arranged in \(\phi\text{-}\mu\text{-}\nu\) triplets with 45 \(\mu\)m resolution, while the GaAs detectors have 20 \(\mu\)m resolution in \(u\text{-}\nu\) stereo.

The transverse-momentum resolution of the combined ATLAS tracker for low-\(p_{\text{T}}\) tracks is \(\sigma(p_{\text{T}})/p_{\text{T}}=5\times 10^{-4}\)\(p_{\text{T}}\)\(\oplus\) 0.012 (GeV).

The main weakness of ATLAS as a detector for B physics, compared to an optimised, dedicated B physics experiment, is that it has no hadron-identification detector.

## 3 B-Physics Reconstruction in ATLAS

Extensive studies have been performed in ATLAS using a full GEANT [6] simulation of the detector followed by event reconstruction in the inner tracker. The reconstruction program uses the Kalman filter formalism [7]. It starts by finding tracks in the TRT; subsequently, hits from the silicon layers are linked to the tracks. For the results presented here, the simulation was restricted to \(\mathrm{|\eta|<0.7}\); work is in progress to extend the study to the forward regions. An example of a fully reconstructed \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi\ K^{0}_{S}}\) event is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Event display showing the reconstruction of a simulated \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi\ K^{0}_{S}}\) event in the ATLAS inner tracker.

The impact-parameter resolution in the plane transverse to the beams, obtained from the detailed detector simulation followed by reconstruction of single-track events, is compared in Figure 3 with a parameterization \(\sigma_{\rm IP}=14\)\(\oplus\)\(72\)/(\(p_{\rm T}\sqrt{|\rm{sin}\theta|}\)) \(\mu\)m used elsewhere in the analysis, where \(\theta\) is the polar angle. In the parameterization, the first term is determined by the positions of the detector layers and their resolutions, while the second term (due to multiple scattering) depends on the layer positions and the amount of material. The impact parameter resolution is calculated assuming a beam-pipe thickness of 0.3% \(X_{0}\) and a thickness of the \(r\) = 6 cm B-physics layer of 0.65% \(X_{0}\). Fairly good agreement is observed between the detailed simulation and the parameterization. The presence of a high-precision layer at low radius is essential to obtain the good impact-parameter resolution. Without this layer the first measurement of the track is at \(r\) = 11.5 cm, giving a resolution about a factor of three worse.

Figure 3: Impact parameter resolution. The curve shows the parameterization used in the particle-level simulation studies. The points are the result of reconstructing tracks after detailed detector simulation.

Another aspect of B-event reconstruction in ATLAS that has been studied is the reconstruction of \(\rm K_{S}^{0}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) decays. Pion tracks are considered if they have \(p_{\rm T}>0.5\) GeV and \(|\eta|<0.7\), and if their distance of closest approach is less than 5 mm. Candidates are accepted for decay radii in the fiducial range \(R_{\rm d}=1-50\) cm. Beauty events with \(\rm B_{d}^{0}\rightarrow\rm J/\psi\ K_{S}^{0}\) decays were passed through a detailed simulation of the detector, before being processed by the ATLAS reconstruction program. The reconstruction efficiency is more than 95% for decays with \(R_{\rm d}<30\) cm, and remains above 85% for \(R_{\rm d}<50\) cm. The reconstructed mass peaks are shown in Figure 4 on logarithmic scales, including pileup corresponding to two different luminosities. For the lower luminosity, typical of the initial running where it is thought much of the B-physics studies will be done, the background under the peak is about 6%; this rises to 11% at the higher luminosity. The mass resolution is typically 3 MeV for \(R_{\rm d}<30\) cm, rising to about 6 MeV for 30 cm \(<\)\(R_{\rm d}<50\) cm where there are few precision points on the pion tracks.

Figure 4: Reconstruction of \(\rm K_{S}^{0}\) decays after detailed GEANT simulation of \(\rm B_{d}^{0}\rightarrow\rm J/\psi\ K_{S}^{0}\) events at two different luminosities.

The reconstruction of J/\(\psi\) decays has been studied for the channels J/\(\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and J/\(\psi\rightarrow\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}}\), where the effect of bremsstrahlung is important for the latter one. The simulation was done for beauty events with \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi\ K_{S}^{0}}\) decays as above. Figure 5a shows the reconstructed mass peak for J/\(\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays with a resolution of 27 MeV and a reconstruction efficiency of 98% per J/\(\psi\). The mass distribution for J/\(\psi\rightarrow\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}}\) decays, shown in Figure 5b, has a significant low-mass tail due to bremsstrahlung, with a fitted (Gaussian) resolution of 47 MeV and a much poorer reconstruction efficiency of 60%. The performance of the reconstruction program for J/\(\psi\rightarrow\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}}\) decays has been significantly improved by allowing for up to two bremsstrahlungs along the track, as shown in Figure 5c. Here the resolution is 52 MeV and the reconstruction efficiency is 77% per J/\(\psi\).

Thus, ATLAS has checked with detailed detector simulation and event reconstruction that the resolutions and efficiencies used in particle-level simulations elsewhere in this paper are reasonable.

## 4 CP Violation Asymmetries

The method by which CP violation will be measured in ATLAS can be illustrated with the example of the decay \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi\ K_{S}^{0}}\) which is sensitive to the angle \(\beta\) in the so-called unitarity triangle [1]. For an initially-pure \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}}\) or \(\mathrm{\bar{B}_{d}^{0}}\) beam, the time dependence of the number of decays is given by \(\frac{\mathrm{d}N}{\mathrm{d}t}(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi\ K_{S}^{0}})\ \alpha\ e^{-\Gamma t}(1\pm\sin 2 \beta\ \sin\Delta mt)\) where the sign of the \(\sin 2\beta\) term depends on the flavour of the initial beam. Expressed as an asymmetry between the number of decays for an initial \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}}\) or \(\mathrm{\bar{B}_{d}^{0}}\) beam, one obtains \(A(t)=\sin 2\beta\ \sin\Delta mt\). In these expressions, \(\Gamma\) = 1/\(\tau\) is the width of the \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}}\), \(\Delta m\) is the mass difference between the CP eigenstates, \(t\) is the proper time and \(\tau\) is the lifetime of the \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}}\). Integrating over time for \(t\) > 0, one obtains an asymmetry \(A=D_{\mathrm{int}}\sin 2\beta\) where the "dilution" factor \(D_{\mathrm{int}}=x_{\mathrm{d}}/(1+x_{\mathrm{d}}{}^{2})=0.47\) with \(x_{\mathrm{d}}=\Delta m/\Gamma\) = 0.69 \(\pm\) 0.10 [8].

As discussed in the introduction, the flavour of the produced \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}}\) is tagged by the charge of the lepton produced in the semileptonic decay of the other b-quark in the event, \(\mathrm{b}\to\ell\). However, this tagging is not fully efficient. Leptons with the wrong sign occur in second-generation decays \(\mathrm{b}\to\mathrm{c}\to\ell\) or if the b-quark forms a neutral B meson that oscillates into its antiparticle. Other, less important, sources of wrong tags come from background leptons (e.g. decays of pions and kaons in flight) and additional b and c quarks in the \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}}\) events. The presence of wrong tags is described by introducing another dilution factor, \(D_{\mathrm{tag}}\) = 1 - 2\(W\), where \(W\) is the fraction of wrong tags. Requiring a tag lepton with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) > 6 GeV, the value \(D_{\mathrm{tag}}\) = 0.52 is obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. The wrong-tag fraction rises for lower tag thresholds due to the increased contribution of second-generation decays. For transverse momenta above 6 GeV, the wrong-tag fraction is approximately constant and is similar for electrons and muons.

The presence of (asymmetry-free) background in the \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi\ K_{S}^{0}}\) sample introduces a third dilution factor, \(D_{\mathrm{back}}=N_{\mathrm{S}}/(N_{\mathrm{S}}+N_{\mathrm{B}})\) where \(N_{\mathrm{S}}\) and \(N_{\mathrm{B}}\) are the numbers of signal and background events respectively.

An additional complication in the analysis is the possible presence of a production asymmetry of \(\mathrm{B}\) and \(\mathrm{\bar{B}}\) mesons due to the non-flavour-symmetric proton-proton initial state. This asymmetry, \(A_{\mathrm{P}}\), is predicted [9] to be at the per-cent level and it can be measured using "control samples" such as \(\mathrm{B^{\pm}\to\ J/\psi\ K^{\pm}}\) and \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi\ K^{\star 0}}\).

Including all the above factors, an approximate expression can be written for the time-integrated asymmetry \(A=D_{\rm tag}\,D_{\rm back}\) (\(D_{\rm int}\,\sin\!2\beta+A_{\rm P}\)). If the dilution factors and the production asymmetry are known, the expression can be inverted to evaluate sin2\(\beta\) with a statistical precision \(\delta\)sin2\(\beta\) = [ \(D_{\rm tag}D_{\rm int}\sqrt{D_{\rm back}}\)/\(N_{S}\)]-1 for \(A<<1\). In fact, the dilution factors and the production asymmetry can be precisely measured using control samples and sidebands around the \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\) mass peak.

If the asymmetry is measured as a function of time, slightly improved statistical precision is possible. Here the dilution factor \(D_{\rm int}\)= 0.47 is replaced by a larger statistical factor (approximately 0.58 assuming the time-dependent measurement starts from \(t\) = 0 and for small \(\beta\)). Of course, in a detailed analysis, the effect of the decay-time resolution has to be taken into account.

The interest in performing a time-dependent asymmetry measurement goes beyond improving the statistical precision of the measurement. It is important to check that the time dependence of the asymmetry has the expected functional form, both as a control of experimental systematic errors and as a test of the Standard Model prediction. In fact, in the decay mode \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\), a more complicated functional form is expected for the time dependence due to the significant contribution from Penguin diagrams.

### Measurements of \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi\,K^{0}_{S}\)

In the ATLAS study of \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi\,K^{0}_{S}\), three data samples are considered: (i) muon tag with J/\(\psi\)\(\rightarrow\) e\({}^{+}\)e, (ii) muon tag with J/\(\psi\rightarrow\)\(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and (iii) electron tag with J/\(\psi\rightarrow\)\(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\). The possibility to measure CP violation with both muon and electron tags gives an important cross-check on experimental systematic errors, for example associated with the relative acceptance to trigger on positive or negative muons.

The trigger for this channel requires a \(p_{\rm T}\) > 6 GeV, \(\rm\eta\)\(|\) < 1.6 muon at the first level. In addition to refining the muon selection and \(p_{\rm T}\) cut, the second-level trigger requires at least one of the following: (i) an e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) pair with electron \(p_{\rm T}\) > 1 GeV and \(\rm\eta\)\(|\) < 2.5 where the electrons are identified in the TRT (rate 200 Hz), (ii) an additional muon with \(p_{\rm T}\) > 5 GeV and \(\rm\eta\)\(|\) < 2.5 (rate 150 Hz), or (iii) a (tag) electron with \(p_{\rm T}\) > 6 GeV and \(\rm\eta\)\(|\) < 2.5 where the electron is identified in the TRT (rate 650 Hz). The total rate from these three second-level triggers is about 1 kHz. The same trigger selects the control samples required to measure the production asymmetry and dilution factors. More details of the ATLAS trigger for \(\rm B\) physics can be found in Ref. [10], where the rates are calculated after particle-level simulations. The feasibility of a TRT-based trigger for J/\(\psi\rightarrow\) e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) has recently been studied using a detailed GEANT simulation.

Figure 6: Reconstruction of \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\to J/\nu K^{0}_{S}\) after particle-level simulation with parameterized resolutions. The background is included as described in the text.

Figure 7: Fit to the time-dependent CP asymmetry distribution for \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\to J/\nu K^{0}_{S}\) decays, for the example of \(\rm sin2\beta=0.6\).

The systematic uncertainties associated with the measurement of \(\sin\!2\beta\) have been studied, considering the control channels \(\mathrm{B^{+}}\rightarrow\mathrm{J}\mathrm{/}\psi\mathrm{\ K^{+}}\) and \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\rightarrow\mathrm{J}\mathrm{/}\psi\mathrm{\ K^{0*}} \rightarrow\mathrm{J}\mathrm{/}\psi\mathrm{\ K^{\cdot}}\pi^{+}\) for which one expects statistics of 30000 events and 11000 events respectively for a one-year run. The \(\mathrm{B^{+}}\rightarrow\mathrm{J}\mathrm{/}\psi\mathrm{\ K^{+}}\) channel is very clean, all three charged particles coming from a common secondary vertex. The systematic error is estimated as \(\delta\mathrm{sin}2\beta\) (syst) = 0.01 which is limited by the statistics in the control samples.

### Measurements of \(B^{0}_{d}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\)

The study of the channel \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) is experimentally more difficult than for \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\rightarrow\mathrm{J}\mathrm{/}\psi\mathrm{\ K^{0}_{S}}\) because one lacks the clean signature of the leptonic \(\mathrm{J}\mathrm{/}\psi\) decay. Instead one has to rely on the secondary vertex signature. For this channel the lack of hadron identification in ATLAS is a disadvantage compared to a dedicated B physics experiment - one has to rely on mass resolution to suppress the background due to reflections with mis-assigned hadrons and there will be residual systematic uncertainties associated with such background.

In the analysis, the following branching fractions are assumed:

* \(BR(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-})=BR(\mathrm{B^{0}_{s}} \rightarrow\mathrm{K^{+}}\pi^{-})=2\times 10^{\text{-}5}\)
* \(BR(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\rightarrow\mathrm{K^{+}}\pi^{-})=BR(\mathrm{B^{0}_{s}} \rightarrow\mathrm{K^{+}}\mathrm{K^{\cdot}})=1\times 10^{\text{-}5}\)
* \(BR(\Lambda_{\mathrm{b}}\rightarrow\mathrm{p}\pi^{-})=1\times 10^{\text{-}4}\)
* \(BR(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\rightarrow\rho^{\pm}\pi^{\pm})=5\times 10^{\text{-}5}\)
* \(BR(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0}\text{ non resonant })=5\times 10^{\text{-}5}\)

The first-level trigger for this analysis is the same as above, namely an inclusive muon trigger with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>6\) GeV, \(|\eta|<1.6\). The trigger muon also tags the flavour of the produced \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\). The second-level trigger uses the TRT and precision tracking to search for tracks with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>3\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\), requiring an unlike-charge pair with invariant mass in the range \(4-6\) GeV. The corresponding trigger rate is 500 Hz.

Additional cuts are made in the analysis, requiring \(\Delta\phi(\pi^{+}\pi^{-})<29^{\text{o}}\), \(\Delta\theta(\pi^{+}\pi^{-})<17^{\text{o}}\) and scaled impact parameters \(f=d/\sigma>3\) for both tracks (to reject tracks not associated with the B decays). The tracks are required to be consistent with a common secondary vertex and the \(p_{\rm T}\) vector of the candidate \({\rm B}^{0}_{\rm d}\) is required to be parallel with the line joining the primary and secondary vertices in the transverse plane (\(\pm 6^{0}\)). Finally, the two-pion mass is required to be within one standard deviation of the \({\rm B}^{0}_{\rm d}\) mass.

The numbers of events expected after a one-year run at \(L\approx 1\times 10^{33}\) cm-\({}^{2}\)s-1 are given in Table 2. Allowance has been made for the trigger and reconstruction efficiencies (80% for the muon and 95% for each pion). The two-pion invariant mass plot is shown in Figure 8 before cutting on the \({\rm B}^{0}_{\rm d}\) mass. The histogram includes events with wrongly assigned hadrons. The decays \({\rm B}^{0}_{\rm s}\to{\rm K}^{+}\pi^{-}\), \({\rm B}^{0}_{\rm d}\to{\rm K}^{+}\pi^{-}\) and \({\rm B}^{0}_{\rm s}\to{\rm K}^{+}{\rm K}^{-}\) all give mass peaks close to the \({\rm B}^{0}_{\rm d}\) mass that are not resolved within the resolution of \(\sigma=50\) MeV. Subtraction of the background will therefore require knowledge of the branching ratios and it will be necessary to make assumptions about possible CP asymmetries in the background channels. It is assumed that the branching ratios will be measured elsewhere before the start-up of LHC.

Figure 8: Reconstruction of \({\rm B}^{0}_{\rm d}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) after particle-level simulation with parameterized resolutions. The background is included as described in the text.

The time dependence of the CP asymmetry in the \(\rm B_{d}^{0}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) channel is expected to be more complicated than in the case of \(\rm B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi~{}K_{S}^{0}\) due to the contribution of Penguin diagrams. Following the notation of Ref. [11], an approximate expression for the asymmetry is

\[A(t)=-2~{}A{\rm p}/A_{\rm T}~{}{\rm sin}\delta~{}{\rm sin}\alpha~{}{\rm cos} \Delta mt~{}-({\rm sin}2\alpha+2~{}A{\rm p}/A_{\rm T}~{}{\rm cos}\delta~{}{\rm cos }2\alpha~{}{\rm sin}\alpha)~{}{\rm sin}\Delta mt\]

where \(A{\rm p}/A_{\rm T}\) is the ratio of Penguin to Tree amplitudes (\(\approx\) 0.2\(\pm\)0.2), \(\delta\) is related to phase differences in final-state interactions and \(\alpha\) is an angle in the unitarity triangle. In the absence of Penguin diagrams, the expression reduces to the simpler form \({\rm sin}2\alpha~{}{\rm sin}\Delta mt\), analogous to the expression in the \(\rm B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi~{}K_{S}^{0}\) channel. Pending a more detailed study that is in progress, results are presented neglecting the contribution from Penguin diagrams and assuming that the background is asymmetry free. A fit to the time-dependent asymmetry distribution yields a statistical precision of \(\delta{\rm sin}2\alpha=0.06\) after a one-year run.

### Search for CP asymmetry in the decay \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\)

Within the Standard Model, little asymmetry is expected in the channel \(\rm B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\)[12]. A recent estimate [13] of the maximum size of the asymmetry in the Standard Model is \(A(t)=A_{\rm CP}~{}{\rm sin}\Delta mt\sim 0.03~{}{\rm sin}\gamma\), where \(\gamma\) is the third angle in the unitarity triangle. This channel, which is rather clean from an experimental point of view, may therefore be rather sensitive to new physics.

Table 2: Numbers of signal and background events for the channel \(\rm B_{d}^{0}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\)In contrast to the \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\) system, the oscillation period of the \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\) is short compared to the lifetime. It is therefore essential to perform a time-dependent analysis - in a time-integrated analysis the dilution factor \(D_{\rm int}\)= \(x_{\rm g}\)/(1+\(x_{\rm S}\)\({}^{2}\)) is small given the large value of the mixing parameter \(x_{\rm s}\)\(\gtrsim\) 8. From an approximate calculation it is estimated that the number of events is about 50% of the \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\rm J\)/\(\psi\)\(\rm K^{0}_{S}\) statistics. Because of the vertex-detector layer at \(r\) = 6 cm, a secondary vertex resolution \(\sigma(r)\) = 60 \(\mu\)m is expected. For a typical \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\) transverse momentum of 14 GeV, this corresponds to a resolution of the decay time of 0.07 ps or 5% of a lifetime.

As an example of a time-dependent fit to the asymmetry, Figure 9 shows the distribution for \(x_{\rm S}\) = 15 and \(A_{\rm CP}\) = 0.6 (much larger than Standard Model predictions). The statistical precision on the measurement is \(\delta A_{\rm CP}\) = 0.05. As discussed below in the context of measuring the time-dependence of \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\) oscillations, the vertex detector resolution allows measurements to be made for \(x_{\rm S}\) values up to or beyond 30.

## 5 \(B_{s}^{0}\) Oscillations

The good secondary-vertex resolution of the ATLAS inner detector, including the B-physics layer at \(r\) = 6 cm, makes possible the measurement of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) mixing parameter up to large values of \(x_{\rm S}\). A study has been made for the channel \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) with \(D_{s}^{-}\to\phi\pi^{-}\) followed by \(\phi\)\(\to\) K\({}^{+}\)K\({}^{-}\), in events where the other b-quark decays semileptonically to a \(p_{\rm T}\)? 6 GeV muon that provides the first-level trigger and tags the flavour of the produced \(B_{s}^{0}\). It is assumed that an efficient second-level trigger can be made, although this has not yet been studied in detail. It may be possible to increase the statistics by using other channels such as \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\)\(\pi^{+}_{1}\), \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi K^{*0}\) and other decay modes of the \(D_{s}^{-}\) such as \(D_{s}^{-}\to K^{-}K^{*0}\).

A detailed study, using a GEANT simulation, has been made of the reconstruction of \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) events in the inner detector (so far limited to \(|\eta|<0.7\)). All tracks were required to have \(p_{\rm T}\)? 1 GeV for which the average reconstruction efficiency per track was found to be 86% - it is expected that the efficiency will be improved through optimisation of the reconstruction program. The mass resolutions for the \(B_{s}^{0}\) and \(D_{s}^{-}\) were found to be 37 MeV and 10 MeV respectively without using \(\phi\) and \(D_{s}^{-}\) mass constraints. Since it is expected to perform this physics at low luminosity, pileup was not included in the simulation.

A vertex fit was made to reconstruct the \(B_{s}^{0}\) decay time as illustrated in Figure 10, first combining the K\({}^{+}\), K\({}^{-}\) and \(\pi^{+}\) to find the \(D_{s}^{-}\) vertex, and then reconstructing the \(B_{s}^{0}\) vertex from the intersection of the \(D_{s}^{-}\) and \(\pi^{+}\). Vertex fitting code [14] from the DELPHI experiment was used, taking as input the track parameters from the ATLAS reconstruction program. A decay time resolution \(\sigma_{\rm t}\) = 0.069 \(\pm\) 0.008 ps was obtained corresponding to a resolution of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) decay length in the transverse plane of about 50 \(\mu\)m.

Figure 10: Sketch showing the method of \(B_{s}^{0}\) vertex reconstruction in \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{0}\pi\) decays.

A particle-level simulation was used to estimate the sample size for the decay channel considered after a one-year run at low luminosity. Including branching ratios, the effect of the cuts (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}>1\) GeV and \(\eta\eta<2.0\) for all tracks, masses consistent with the \(\phi\) and \(\mathrm{D_{S}}\) and displaced secondary vertex requirement) and the trigger and reconstruction efficiencies (80% for the muon and 95% for each hadron), one expects 1825 events.

Background was considered from two sources: (i) B decays with equal or higher multiplicity than the channel under study such as \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}\to D^{-}_{s}\pi^{+}}\), \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}\to D^{-}\pi^{+}}\) and \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{b}\to\Lambda^{+}_{c}}\) with \(\Lambda^{+}_{c}\to pK^{-}\pi^{+}\). These backgrounds do not contribute significantly after mass cuts. (ii) Combinatorial background in which some or all of the particles do not originate from a B decay. The estimation of this background requires very large Monte Carlo statistics. Based on the fact that no events are observed with \(m(\mathrm{KK}\pi\pi)\) in the range 5 - 6 GeV in the available Monte Carlo sample, an upper limit for this background is 1500 events in a 50 MeV mass bin. In the following, a signal-to-background ratio of 1:1 is assumed.

In the presence of \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{s}}\) oscillations the number of \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{s}}\) or \(\mathrm{\overline{B}^{0}_{s}}\) decays observed as a function of time for an initially pure \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{s}}\) beam is \(\frac{\mathrm{d}N}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{N}{2}\,\mathrm{e}^{-t/t}(1\pm\cos(x_{ \mathrm{S}}t/\tau))\) where \(N\) is the number of \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{s}}\) produced, \(t\) is the decay time, \(\tau\) is the \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{s}}\) lifetime and \(x_{\mathrm{S}}\) is the mixing parameter. In the presence of wrong tags, mainly due to mixing and second-generation decays of the other B particle in the event, a dilution factor has to be introduced: \(\frac{\mathrm{d}N}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{N}{2\tau}\,\mathrm{e}^{-t/t}(1\pm D_{ \mathrm{tag}}\cos(x_{\mathrm{S}}t/\tau))\), where the dilution factor is \(D_{\mathrm{tag}}=0.52\) as in the CP-violation studies. In the following, we use a \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{s}}\) lifetime of 1.29 ps - a higher lifetime would increase the range of sensitivity to \(x_{\mathrm{S}}\).

A simple Monte Carlo program was developed, generating the time-dependent distributions, including background and the detector resolution. A fit was made to the generated distributions to determine \(x_{\mathrm{S}}\), only using decays with decay times above 0.4 ps. For 1800 signal events, a fit to the distribution generated with \(x_{\mathrm{S}}(\mathrm{generated})=30\) yielded a measurement \(x_{\mathrm{S}}(\mathrm{measured})=29.94\pm 0.16\) where the error is statistical. Thus, a precise measurement of \(x_{\mathrm{S}}\) should be possible after a single year of running at \(L=1\times 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) if the value of \(x_{\mathrm{S}}\) is below 30.

The sensitivity of the experiment to \(x_{\mathrm{S}}\) may be improved with larger data samples. The detector layer at \(r=6\) cm should be operable, in view of radiation damage, up to an integrated luminosity corresponding to six years at \(L=1\times 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). Thus, even with the single decay channel considered here, it might be possible to obtain a sample of about 11000 events before having to remove (or replace) the innermost detector layer. With such statistics, the oscillations are very clearly observable for \(x_{\mathrm{S}}=20\), and a precise measurement can be made for \(x_{\mathrm{S}}=35\), as shown in Figure 11. For \(x_{\mathrm{S}}(\mathrm{generated})=35\), the fit gives \(x_{\mathrm{S}}(\mathrm{measured})=35.04\pm 0.13\). These fit results have been checked with an independent method using a discrete Fourier transform of the time-dependent asymmetry.

## 6 Other B physics topics

Many other studies of B physics can be made in ATLAS. Precise measurements of the differential cross-sections for b-quark production provide a test of QCD and can be compared with results at lower energies [15, 16, 17].

Certain rare decays, notably \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\) and \(\mathrm{B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\) lend themselves particularly well to searches (or measurements) at LHC. In the Standard Model, the predicted branching ratios for these processes [18] are \(\sim\)10-10 and \(\sim\)10-9 respectively. The measurement of significantly larger branching ratios would be of considerable interest. From an experimental point of view, these decays are very attractive. The two muons can be cleanly identified and provide a very low ratetrigger, even at the first level. The mass resolution expected in ATLAS for such decays is about 50 MeV.

A preliminary study has been made of the sensitivity to the decay \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\), requiring both muons to have \(\mbox{$p_{\mathrm{T}}$}>6\) GeV and \(\mathrm{|\eta|<1.6}\) with \(\mbox{$p_{\mathrm{T}}$}(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})>20\) GeV. Considering the background from \(\mathrm{b\bar{b}}\) events in which the \(\mathrm{b}\) and \(\mathrm{\bar{b}}\) both decay semileptonically to muons, one expects \(2\times 10^{5}\) events within \(\pm 100\) MeV (two standard deviations) of the \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}}\) mass before vertex cuts from a one-year (\(10^{7}\) s) run at \(L\approx 1\times 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). After the cuts, the cross-section for \(\mathrm{pp\to B_{d}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\) is 1.0 \(\mathrm{\mu b\times}BR(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}})\) which translates into a number of events observed \(\approx\)\(10^{10}\times BR(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}})\). Considering a potential signal above the background, a one-standard deviation fluctuation of \(\sqrt{2\times 10^{5}}\) =500 events corresponds to a branching ratio of \(5\times 10^{-8}\). The sensitivity to \(\mathrm{B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\) is about a factor of three worse because of the lower production rate compared to \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}}\).

Results are not yet available from a study using precision vertexing which requires very large statistics background samples. However, it is evident that the sensitivity can be improved by requiring that the two muons are inconsistent with the primary vertex, are consistent with a common secondary vertex, and that the \(\mbox{$p_{\mathrm{T}}$}\) of the \(\mathrm{B^{0}}\) candidate is parallel to the line joining the primary and secondary vertices. Such cuts will also be very effective in suppressing backgrounds where the muons originate at or very close to the primary vertex, such as Drell-Yan pairs. In some respects the requirements for the present analysis are similar to those in the \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}}\) analysis described above. In the case of \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}}\), such cuts reduced the number of events in which the two tracks did not both originate from a single B hadron by a factor of about 700, while retaining about 40% of the signal. If a similar improvement in sensitivity can be achieved in the search for \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\), ATLAS will be sensitive to a branching ratio \(\lesssim 10^{-8}\) after a single year of running at low luminosity.

Given that the search for \(\mathrm{B^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\) decays can be continued over many years and at luminosities much above \(1\times 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), one might hope to approach the range of Standard Model predictions for \(BR(\mathrm{B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}})\), even if the real interest lies in observing an indication for physics beyond the Standard Model.

Another topic that has been studied in ATLAS is B baryon production and decay. The channel \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{b}}\to\mathrm{J/}\psi\Lambda\) should be cleanly observable and will be selected with the same triggers as for the \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to\mathrm{J/}\psi K_{S}^{0}}\) CP violation study. The analysis does not require a tag lepton, so large statistics can be obtained in events where the \(\mathrm{J/}\psi\) decays to two muons with \(\mbox{$p_{\mathrm{T}}$}>5\) GeV, \(\mathrm{|\eta|<2.5}\), with at least one muon having \(\mbox{$p_{\mathrm{T}}$}>6\) GeV, \(\mathrm{|\eta|<1.6}\) (first-level trigger). For a production branching ratio \(BR(\mathrm{b\to\Lambda_{b}\to J/}\psi\Lambda)=0.5\times 10^{-3}\), corresponding to the CDF upper limit [19] and lower that the UA1 measurement [20], one would expect \(2\times 10^{5}\) events from a one-year run at \(L=1\times 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). A study [21] has been made of the feasibility of measuring the polarisation of B baryons, using the angular distributions of the decays \(\Lambda_{\rm b}\to{\rm J/}\psi\Lambda\), \(\Lambda\to{\rm p}\pi^{*}\), and \({\rm J/}\psi\to\ell^{+}\ell\). The process is described by the \(\Lambda_{\rm b}\) polarisation, four decay helicity amplitudes and the known asymmetry parameter of the \(\Lambda\to{\rm p}\pi^{*}\) decay, \(\alpha(\Lambda)=0.646\). The \({\rm J/}\psi\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) decay depends on only one amplitude which is included in the normalisation factor.

The angular distribution can be written in terms of three measurable angles that are defined in Figure 12:

\[1+\alpha_{1}P_{\rm b}{\rm cos}\theta+\alpha_{2}\alpha_{\Lambda}{ \rm cos}\theta_{1}+\alpha_{3}P_{\rm b}\alpha_{\Lambda}{\rm cos}\theta{\rm cos} \theta_{1}+\] \[{\rm d}_{00}{}^{2}(\theta_{2})(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}P_{\rm b}{\rm cos }\theta+\beta_{2}\alpha_{\Lambda}{\rm cos}\theta_{1}+\beta_{3}P_{\rm b}\alpha _{\Lambda}{\rm cos}\theta{\rm cos}\theta_{1})\]

where \(\alpha_{\rm i}\) and \(\beta_{\rm i}\) are linear combinations of the squared-modulii of the four decay helicity amplitudes normalised to unity (\(\alpha_{1}=\alpha(\Lambda_{\rm b})\)). From the experimental angular distribution in \(\theta\), \(\theta_{1}\) and \(\theta_{2}\), one can measure seven independent moments:

\[<{\rm cos}\theta>,\ <{\rm cos}\theta_{1}>,\ <{\rm cos}\theta{\rm cos }\theta_{1}>,\ <{\rm d}_{00}{}^{2}(\theta_{2})>,\ <{\rm d}_{00}{}^{2}(\theta_{2}){\rm cos} \theta>,\ <{\rm d}_{00}{}^{2}(\theta_{2}){\rm cos}\theta_{1}>,\] \[<{\rm d}_{00}{}^{2}(\theta_{2}){\rm cos}\theta{\rm cos}\theta_{1}>\]

Since the system of equations is over-constrained, one can determine the polarisation \(P_{\rm b}\). For \(2\times 10^{5}\) events, the estimated statistical precision is \(\delta P_{\rm b}=0.01\).

A final topic that has been considered is doubly-heavy B hadrons such as the \({\rm B_{c}}\) meson. One might expect a few thousand events per year in the channel \({\rm B_{c}}\to{\rm J/}\psi\pi\) assuming a production rate \(\sim\)10-3 that of B- and a decay branching ratio \(BR({\rm B_{c}}\to{\rm J/}\psi\pi^{-})=2\times 10^{\cdot}3\). This decay should be rather clean experimentally (all three charged particles come from a common

secondary vertex) and \(\mathrm{J/\!\!/}\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) provides an efficient trigger. It may be possible to measure the masses and lifetimes for such states.

## 7 Conclusions

ATLAS is primarily a detector for high luminosity LHC physics. However, the needs of B physics are being taken into account in the design. Examples are the TRT that allows the identification of very low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) electrons, a low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) muon trigger exploiting the air-core toroid and high-precision vertexing near the interaction point. Using the LHC in collider mode brings the benefits of high rate and low background, the first-level trigger giving a 40%-pure B-event sample. Although the experiment is not expected to start taking data before 2002, the detector has been simulated in detail and B decays have been fully reconstructed.

The experiment has good sensitivity to CP violation and can make measurements in several channels. From the decay mode \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}}\rightarrow\mathrm{J/\!\!/}\psi\mathrm{\ K_{S}^{0}}\) a statistical precision \(\delta\mathrm{sin}2\beta=0.027\) is estimated for a one-year run at low luminosity; the systematic errors can be controlled at the level of 0.01. For the decay channel \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\), a statistical precision \(\delta\mathrm{sin}2\alpha=0.06\) is estimated. However, here the lack of hadron identification in ATLAS is a disadvantage compared to a dedicated experiment. An interesting channel in which to search for CP-violation mechanisms beyond the Standard Model is \(\mathrm{B_{s}^{0}}\rightarrow\mathrm{J/\!\!/}\psi\phi\). This decay, which involves the \(\mathrm{B_{s}^{0}}\) meson, may not have been studied at B factories before the start-up of LHC.

The good vertexing capabilities of ATLAS allow the study of \(\mathrm{B_{s}^{0}}\) oscillations with good precision. The estimated sensitivity for a one-year run at low luminosity is \(x_{\mathrm{s}}=30\), increasing to about 35 with six times more data.

In conclusion, a broad programme of B physics can be studied with the ATLAS detector as soon as the LHC turns on.
