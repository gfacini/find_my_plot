Various types of crosstalk, measured with ATLAS-like electronics on three electromagnetic endcap calorimeter production modules at liquid argon temperature are reviewed. A comparison is made between the three modules results and previous measurements. The effect on the physics data is discussed.

Introduction

Crosstalk analyses have been already carried out on the barrel and endcap electromagnetic calorimeter full-size prototype modules [1, 2, 3]. This note aims to give a review of the crosstalk measured in the three endcap production modules tested in 2001 (ECC0, ECC1) and 2002 (ECC5) using ATLAS-like electronics[4]. The crosstalk map for the three modules at liquid argon temperature, is addressed. A comparison is also performed between the three modules and the module 0 results. This note is organized as follows: generalities about crosstalk measurements and an overview of the problematic channels are given in section 2. The capacitive crosstalk which is dominant in the highly segmented part of the detector (the front sampling S1), is presented in section 3. The resistive crosstalk coming from the ink resistors connecting the high voltage (HV) between S1 and S2 on the electrode is given in section 4. Crosstalk measurements on S2 and S3 samplings are given in section 5. The long distance crosstalk coming from the rest of the electronic chain is discussed in section 6. In section 7, some aspects of the crosstalk impact on physics data are examined.

## 2 Generalities and problematic channels

A complete description of the testbeam experimental setup and of the module electronics is given in [4] and [5]. The summing boards (SB) are plugged on the electrode connectors and perform the signal summation in \(\phi\): 12 adjacent electrodes are summed for a front cell and 3(4) for middle and back cells in the outer (inner) wheel. Mother boards (MB) are plugged on top of the summing boards. They ensure the signal routing and the distribution of calibration signals through resistive networks. Three feedthroughs are necessary to read the module. FT0 covers \(1.6<\eta<2.4\) and \(0<\phi<0.4\), FT1 covers the same range in \(\eta\) as FT0 and \(0.4<\phi<0.8\) and FT2 covers \(0.<\phi<0.8\) with \(\eta<1.6\) or \(\eta>2.4\). FT2 has an ATLAS-like gold-plated pin carrier. In contrary to the others, the FT1 baseplane was already used for Module 0 beam test in 1999.

On top of the cryostat, ATLAS-like electronics (Front End Boards -FEBs- and 2 calibration boards) is located in two crates.

For the crosstalk measurement, the two quantities of interest are:

* the peak to peak crosstalk (X\({}_{max}\)), where the maximum amplitude of the crosstalk signal is normalized to the peak amplitude of the signal;
* the crosstalk under the peak (X(t\({}_{max}\))), where the crosstalk at the signal peak time (t\({}_{max}\)) is divided by the peak amplitude of the signal.

It should be stressed that X(t\({}_{max}\)) is the most relevant quantity for physics.

The problematic cells - leading to an exceptionally high or low crosstalk for these cells - come from:* the testbeam setup: problems on the cables installed on the cryostat feedthrough (warm cables and pig tails) lead to channels with no signal or with very low amplitude ones. The 18 corresponding channels are common to all tested modules and are given in table 1. The correspondence between physical \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) values and their channel numbers in the three samplings are given in table 2;
* the warm side (warm cable, baseplane) of FT1 (\(\phi_{S2}\geq 16\) and \(8\leq\eta_{S2}<40\)): generates an additional crosstalk. This effect worsens with time. Figure 1 shows an example of this effect through the observed S1\(\rightarrow\)S2 "crosstalk". The upper left plot is for FT0. The others show the FT1 problem and its evolution with time (the modules where tested in this chronological order: ECC0, ECC1 and ECC5);
* Dead1: 8 channels in ECC0, 6 in ECC1 and 2 in ECC5

High capacitive coupling: 3 channels in ECC0 * Unexpected shape: 3 channels in ECC0 and 1 channel in ECC1

The complete list of these cells for the three modules are presented in table 3. In addition, ECC0 shows 18 cells with strange shapes and low amplitudes2.

Footnote 2: The mother boards used for this module were different from the ones used for the production modules. This has led to lots of problematic channels (most of the 18 cells with strange shapes belong to this category). The mother boards have been replaced after the test.

There is a total of 3888 cells per module and it is found that 0.82% of the cells for ECC0, 0.18% for ECC1 and 0.05% for ECC5 exhibit a singular behaviour. Apart from ECC0, these results satisfy the ATLAS criteria.

In the following we will discuss the results for the channels that does not belong to the problematic samples. Moreover, in order to deal with relevant quantities, the gain factors allowing to convert -for each cell- ADC counts to energy have been applied. These factors take into account the different injection resistance for each sampling and the fact that each strip sees 2 middle (or back) pulsed cells in \(\phi\).

## 3 Capacitive crosstalk (S1 \(\rightarrow\) S1)

In the region where S1 is equipped with strips (\(4\leq\eta\leq 211\)), the main contribution is expected to come from the capacitive coupling (\(C_{x}\)) between detector cells. The cells out of the strips region (\(0\leq\eta\leq 3\) and \(212\leq\eta\leq 215\)) are expected to behave like S2 and S3 cells. According to [1], \(C_{x}\) is expected to decrease with \(\eta\), from 60 pF to 30 pF while the detector capacitance varies from 90 to 160 pF depending on \(\eta\). Accordingly, X\({}_{max}\) and X(t\({}_{max}\)) should decrease with values in the ranges 6-10% and 2-5% respectively. Figure 2 gives the results averaged over \(\phi\) for the 3 modules. The same features are observed for all the modules. Decreasing values of the peak to peak crosstalk in the range 4-8% (slightly lower than the Module 0 results) and for the crosstalk under the peak in the range \(2-5\%\) are observed. The decreasing is seen over all \(\eta\) range and it is independent of \(\phi\).3 The drops observed for \(\eta=36\) and \(\eta=212\) are due to the change of the FT at these values. The systematic dip observed each 8/12/8 strips depending on the detector granularity can be explained by the crosstalk from the summing board (\(\sim 2\%\) for the peak to peak crosstalk and \(\sim 1\%\) for the crosstalk under the peak). As already mentioned, the regions \(0\leq\eta\leq 3\) and \(212\leq\eta\leq 215\) show a smaller crosstalk which is an inductive one and it's to be compared with the values of section 5.

Footnote 3: This is to compare with the Module 0 situation where two different kinds of electrodes were used in the stacking leading to a dependence on \(\phi\).

We also measured the crosstalk amplitude for a channel located 2 strips away from the pulsed channel. Values are in the range 0.5-1.% for the peak to peak crosstalk and \(<0.5\%\) for the crosstalk under the peak.

## 4 Front \(\leftrightarrow\) middle (Resistive) crosstalk

The resistive crosstalk is due to the ink resistor on the HV side of the electrode. It is proportional to the inverse of the equivalent resistance obtained as the summation in parallel of the resistors (one for each electrode) located in front of the pulsed S2 cell. Along with the resistive crosstalk, there is an additional contribution from long distance crosstalk. Due to the configuration mapping of S2, when a strip is in front of an S2 cell pulsed in configuration 0 and 1, it is not in configuration 2 and 3 (and vice versa). The resistive crosstalk in this strip can thus be deduced as:

\[X_{M-F}=\left|X\left(0\right)-X\left(2\right)\right|+\left|X\left(1\right)-X \left(3\right)\right| \tag{1}\]

Figure 3 shows the resistive crosstalk averaged over \(\phi\) for the 3 modules. The small window inside this figure shows that the crosstalk shape obtained after subtraction of the long distance contribution has the same feature as the signal shape indicating thus a

Figure 2: _S1\(\rightarrow\)S1 capacitive crosstalk averaged on \(\phi\). The upper plot gives both the peak to peak crosstalk and the crosstalk under the peak for ECC0 while the others give the peak to peak crosstalk for ECC1 and ECC5._resistive crosstalk type. We observe a very similar behaviour in the three cases. Apart from the two boundary regions (\(\eta\) channels:0-3 and 212-215)4, there are 3 zones corresponding to different detector granularities. In fact, the \(\eta\)-channels 4-99, 100-147 and 148-211 correspond respectively to 8, 6 and 4 strips for 0.025 width in \(\eta\) (1 middle cell). Thus passing from the first to the second zone for instance, the crosstalk is increased by a factor 8/6. On the other hand, the border effect is seen: the first and the last strips of a group facing one S2 cell have larger HV resistances leading to lower crosstalk. In addition, ECC5 exhibits slightly (\(\sim 20\%\)) higher values.5 This effect was traced back to the lower resistance values measured at warm.

Footnote 4: Lower ink resistors are present in the first region and both regions have larger cells (a 0.025 width in \(\eta\)).

Footnote 5: It is to notice that this effect is not due to the FT1 problem since the higher crosstalk values are observed in the \(\phi\leq 4\) region.

The S1\(\rightarrow\)S2 crosstalk has already been mentioned in section 2 to show the FT effect. It has to be stressed however, that even for the region where no FT effect is present, and unlike the S2\(\rightarrow\)S1 case, there is no way to subtract the long distance crosstalk component.

Inverse of resistance values measured at warm, after the bending of the electrodes, are shown for the three modules in figure 4 along with the values of 1/R deduced from the crosstalk measurement at cold. The shapes of the two quantities are similar modulo a constant multiplicative factor. The mean value of \(\frac{R_{\mathrm{mod}}^{crossat\,\mathrm{d}k}}{R_{\mathrm{max}}^{crossat\, \mathrm{d}k}}\) is found to be respectively \(1.56\pm 0.12\), \(1.58\pm 0.11\) and \(1.50\pm 0.10\) for ECC0(\(\phi=0\)), ECC1(\(\phi=1\)) and ECC5(\(\phi=4\)) (see figure 5) which are consistent with previous analyses performed mainly on the barrel[6]. The small accumulations observed on fig.5 close to 2 have been traced back to the lower crosstalk amplitudes (i.e. higher resistances) measured on the last strip of each group of strips facing one middle cell.

For the ECC1 case where the data were available, a comparison between the resistances measured at warm and those deduced from the crosstalk at warm was made. The result for \(\phi=1\) gives a mean value of the ratio \(\frac{R_{\mathrm{max}}^{crossat\,\mathrm{d}k}}{R_{\mathrm{max}}^{crossat\, \mathrm{d}k}}\) of \(0.92\pm 0.05\) in quiet good agreement with the expected value of 1.

## 5 Inductive crosstalk

New mother boards have been designed and used for the production modules. We expect an inductive crosstalk in the range 0.5-1.0% coming from these new boards.

### Middle to middle crosstalk

Figure 6 shows the crosstalk averaged over the \(\phi\) range for the 3 modules. The values are much lower than those measured in the module 0 as we expect with the new mother boards. For the outer wheel, the under the peak (peak to peak) crosstalk for the 3 modules in the region \(\phi<16\) is indeed \(<0.5\%(\leq 2\%)\) all over the range \(4\leq\eta<40\). The observed \(\Delta\eta=4\) periodicity is linked to the summing boards width in \(\eta\) which is 4. Outside the \(4\leq\eta<40\) region, the crosstalk goes up to \(\sim 4\%\). The high crosstalk values in the region \(2.4<\eta<2.5\) is explained by the absence of a ground return on the electrode connector at low radius. For the inner wheel, \(X_{\mathit{max}}\) is in the range 0.5%-2.5% and \(X\left(t_{\mathit{max}}\right)\) in the range 0.5%-1.5%.

### Back to back crosstalk

Unlike the S2 case, S3 cells are not sensitive to the capacitive crosstalk. Because of the S3 configuration pattern (each summing board is linked to 2 cells), the pulsed and the read cells can belong to the same summing board or to two adjacent ones. Thus, odd and even \(\eta\)-channels have different amplitudes. In the latter case, the pulsed and the read cells do not belong to the same summing board and thus the read one is not sensitive to the crosstalk coming from the 'cold electronics'. A lower crosstalk amplitude is then expected that comes partly from the long distance crosstalk and amounts to \(\sim 0.5\%\). For the case in which the read and pulsed cells belong to the same summing board, figure 7 shows the crosstalk amplitudes averaged over \(\phi\) both in the outer and the inner wheels. Amplitudes in the outer wheel and \(1<\eta<18\) are of the order of 2.5-3.5% for the peak Figure 6: _S2 \(\rightarrow\) S2 crosstalk averaged on the \(\phi<16\) region for the 3 modules for both outer (left) and inner (right) wheels.

to peak crosstalk and 0.5-1.2% for the crosstalk under the peak. In the inner wheel, the corresponding values are 1.4-3.8% for the peak to peak crosstalk and 1.-2.8% for the crosstalk under the peak.

### Middle \(\leftrightarrow\) back crosstalk

Figures 8 and 9 show the crosstalk amplitudes obtained respectively for the S3\(\rightarrow\)S2 and S2\(\rightarrow\)S3 cases in both wheels for the 3 modules. It is to notice again that the new mother boards allow to have lower crosstalk than for the module 0. The averaged over \(\phi\) peak to peak crosstalk is \(\leq 1\%\) almost over the whole \(\eta\) range.

## 6 Long Distance crosstalk(S1 \(\leftrightarrow\) S3)

In this section, we present the results of the 'long distance' crosstalk which includes all what occurs in the electronic chain after the mother board: a harness, pig tails, warm cables, baseplanes, calibration board,and FEBs. These various contributions may be separated and estimated by looking to what happens in various configurations and (\(\eta\),\(\phi\)) regions. The calibration board contribution can be looked for in \(\eta\) regions where the S3 calibration lines are close to the S1 ones. As expected, this affects mainly channels with the same parity. The results for the S3 \(\rightarrow\) S1 case are very similar for the 3 modules and they reproduce what was found for the module 0. No crosstalk contribution from calibration boards is expected in \(\eta\)-channels 0-35 and 212-215, because calibration lines

The vertical dotted lines indicate the summing boards width in \(\eta\)._

of S1 and S3 are far away. This is also the case for \(\eta\)-channels 36-99, except for even configuration in the \(\phi\geq 4\) region. For \(\eta\)-channels 100-211, the main contribution comes from the calibration board. Figure 10 shows the crosstalk result for ECC1 in the case (conf=1,\(\phi\)=0). The calibration board contribution varies from 0 to 0.025% for the three modules depending on the calibration line position with respect to the pulsed line on the output connector.

Figure 11 shows the mean value of the S3\(\rightarrow\)S1 highest crosstalk amplitude for the 3 modules in various \(\eta\)-regions. On the same figure, the S1\(\rightarrow\)S3 crosstalk amplitudes averaged over \(\phi\) for the 3 modules are given. This contribution comes from outside the cryostat (feedthrough, warm cable and/or baseplane).

## 7 Crosstalk in physics data

In this section a brief review of how the crosstalk measured in calibration runs affect physics data is given. The capacitive crosstalk is not easy to observe in physics data. The resistive contribution is very small (0.1-0.2%) and may be neglected. As energy measurement is concerned, the most relevant crosstalk component is the inductive one6. This inductive crosstalk comes from the 'cold electronics' boards and induces a distortion of the physics signals in S2 and S3. A muon beam is the best way to measure the crosstalk in physics. However, the available data with muons have small statistics. Therefore, we use electron data. Figure 12 shows the signal shapes of cells in an S2 5\(\times\)5 cluster with

The high S1\(\rightarrow\)S3 crosstalks observed for \(\eta=4\) and \(\eta=14\) respectively for ECC0 and ECC1 are related to dead cells._

the central cell at \((\eta,\,\phi)=(32,4)\) for a 120 GeV electron beam. Only one cell exhibit an undershoot. It is expected that for S3 the situation will be worse since electrons deposit most of their energy in S2 and S3 will thus be affected by a high (in proportion to the energy deposit) inductive S2\(\rightarrow\)S3 crosstalk. In figure 13, we see that more cells of the 3\(\times\)3 cluster in S3 are affected. These distortions are however very small in comparison with those observed in the module 0[2].

## 8 Conclusions

The analysis of the calibration delay runs taken on the three EMEC production modules (ECC0, ECC1 and ECC5), during the 2001 and 2002 test beam periods, has been presented. Apart from the problems related to the cryostat, less than 0.2% of singular channels has been found for the modules tested with the new mother boards. Three main kinds of crosstalk have been reviewed: the capacitive one for the strips, the inductive one for S2 and S3 and the resistive one between S1 and S2. In the last case, a comparison with the measurement made at warm has been done. The results for the three modules are very similar. Whenever the mother boards are concerned, the crosstalks are lower than those observed in the module 0. The results are summarized in figure 14.
