###### Abstract

The selection of events with hadronically decaying tau leptons is challenging due to high background rates at the LHC. On the other hand, efficient selection of events with tau leptons increases the discovery potential of ATLAS in many physics channels, notably Standard Model or Supersymmetric (SUSY) Higgs boson production. In this note we describe the ATLAS tau trigger system, focusing on the early data taking period, and present results from studies based on simulated events, including trigger rates and the acceptance of tau leptons from \(W\) and \(Z\) boson decays, Higgs Boson decays, and SUSY processes. In order to cope with the rate and optimize the efficiency of important physics channels, the results of the current simulation studies indicate that ATLAS tau triggers should include either relatively high transverse momentum single tau signatures, or low transverse momentum tau signatures in combination with other signatures, such as missing transverse energy, leptons, or jets.

Introduction

Tau triggers are designed to select hadronic decays of tau leptons, which mainly consist of one or three charged pions accompanied with a neutrino and possibly neutral pions. Leptonic tau decays are typically selected by electron [1] or muon [2] triggers. Tau triggers are an important part of the ATLAS trigger system, a fundamental component of the ATLAS detector [3].

ATLAS will collect data at different luminosities, starting from \(10^{31}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\)\(\mathrm{s}^{-1}\). At the lowest luminosity the focus of tau triggers is to collect samples that are useful for understanding the detector and the tau reconstruction software. Tau signatures combined with missing transverse energy signatures are essential to provide data samples enriched in W\(\rightarrow\tau\nu\) events, which provide an important sample of real taus needed to refine tau identification algorithms. Additionally, single tau triggers with large prescale factors will provide samples for tau fake rates studies.

At higher luminosities, tau triggers will cope with the event rate increase by using higher \(E_{T}\) threshold requirements, more restrictive identification requirements, or demanding a combination of different signatures, such as missing transverse energy, jets, or leptons. At high luminosity, tau triggers will be essential to enable the collection of data samples for searches based on single tau lepton final states, like Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) \(H^{\pm}\rightarrow\tau\nu\)[4] decays. They will also be used for final states with more than one tau lepton, like SM Higgs boson [5], MSSM neutral Higgs boson [6], or \(Z^{\prime}\) boson [7] decays.

The results presented in this paper are based on events fully simulated with GEANT4. The text is organized as follows. An overview of the three-level trigger selection for single tau triggers is presented in Section 2, while the performance in terms of resolution, rates, and efficiencies is described in Section 3. Timing studies of tau trigger algorithms are presented in Section 4. The current tau trigger menu, which includes various single and combined tau triggers, is described in Section 5, with a focus on the early data taking period corresponding to a luminosity of \(10^{31}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\)\(\mathrm{s}^{-1}\). Finally, a summary is presented in Section 6.

## 2 Overview of single tau trigger selection

### Level 1 selection

The L1 tau trigger selection is closely related to the L1 electron/photon trigger (\(e/\gamma\)), and is fully documented in [8]. It is a hardware trigger based on electromagnetic (e.m.) and hadronic calorimeter information, and uses trigger towers of approximate size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\), with a coverage up to \(|\eta|\)\(<2.5\) (given by the inner-detector coverage and the high-granularity e.m. calorimetry).

The algorithm considers a rectangular Region of Interest (RoI) of \(4\times 4\) towers (\(0.4\times 0.4\) in \(\eta\times\phi\)) in both the e.m. and hadronic calorimeters, and makes use of different elements, each formed by summing \(E_{T}\) over a group of towers. The algorithm uses the following quantities:

* the central \(2\times 2\)_core_ cluster is the energy measured in the central \(2\times 2\) e.m. and hadronic towers
* the _TauCluster_ is the energy defined by the two most energetic neighboring central towers in the e.m. calorimeter plus the central \(2\times 2\) towers of the hadronic calorimeter
* _EmIsol_ is the energy in the e.m. isolation ring (the region between \(2\times 2\) and \(4\times 4\) towers in the e.m. calorimeter).
* _HadIsol_ is the energy in the hadronic isolation ring (region between \(2\times 2\) and \(4\times 4\) towers in the hadronic calorimeter).

The L1 tau trigger candidate is accepted if the core cluster is a local \(E_{T}\) maximum and also satisfies additional conditions on _TauCluster_, _EmIsol_ and _HadIsol_[8]. Its position is taken as the center of the 4\(\times\)4 tower RoI, and its energy is calibrated using a procedure derived for jets (see Section 2.1.1). A maximum of eight trigger thresholds are available at L1 for taus. Each threshold is a combination of requirements of \(E_{T}\) thresholds for _TauCluster_, _EmIsol_ and _HadIsol_. A L1 tau trigger candidate passing the requirements is then passed to L2 for further examination.

#### 2.1.1 Level 1 Calorimeter Calibration

Trigger towers are formed by the analogue summation of calorimeter cells. Calibration of the trigger consists of adjusting the overall gains of the towers. The e.m. towers are calibrated to optimize the e.m. trigger response. The gains of the hadronic towers are adjusted to provide a uniform jet response in \(\eta\) using a jet sample with an \(E_{T}\) range 50-100 GeV and making \(\eta\)-dependent adjustments to the trigger thresholds.

### Level 2 selection

The L2 tau trigger selection uses the full calorimeter granularity and the inclusion of tracking information from the Inner Detector to refine the L1 selection. The selection is designed to further reject QCD jet backgrounds by exploiting more of the characteristics of a hadronic tau decay, such as collimation and low track multiplicity.

#### 2.2.1 Level 2 calorimeter selection

At this stage, the selection of the single tau triggers is based on the calorimeter shower shape variables and the energy of a reconstructed cluster within the RoI to enrich the sample of tau candidates. Shape variables are calculated using only the second e.m. sampling layer (out of four). The second sampling is where most of the e.m. energy is deposited, therefore it provides the most information about the e.m. shower shape. The cluster energy is calculated with all available e.m. and hadronic layers. Three different rectangular windows are defined, centered on a _seed_ cluster, with areas of \(\eta\times\phi=0.1\times 0.1\) (narrow, _Nar_), \(0.2\times 0.2\) (wide, _Wid_), and \(0.3\times 0.3\) (normal, _Nor_)2. The _Nor_ window is equivalent to the RoI used at L2.

Footnote 2: The window sizes are currently subject of optimization studies.

The algorithm consists of several steps. First, a _seed_ cluster is found, using the second e.m. sampling. The algorithm unpacks cells in the _Nor_ window centered around the L1 RoI position, and finds the cell with the highest energy deposition. In a _Wid_ window around the most energetic cell, the cluster position is defined as the energy weighted mean position of the cells. Then, shape variables are reconstructed using the different windows around the _seed_, as described in the following. At the same time, the total energy in all calorimeter samplings is computed. Finally, the total energy is corrected with a simple sampling calibration.

The variables used by the L2 Calorimeter selection are the following:

* _EMRadius_ is the energy weighted squared radius of the _seed_, which is obtained from the sum of the individual energy weighted squared cell distances from the _seed_. It is calculated in a _Nor_ window around the _seed_, in the second sampling of the e.m. calorimeter, i.e. \[EMRadius=\frac{\sum_{Nor}E_{cell}\cdot R_{cell}^{2}}{\sum_{Nor}E_{ cell}}.\] (1)* _IsoFrac_ is the difference in energy between the _Nar_ and _Wid_ window, normalized to the _Wid_ window. It is calculated in the second sampling of the e.m. calorimeter. The definition is \[isoFrac=\frac{\sum_{Wid}E_{cell}-\sum_{Nar}E_{cell}}{\sum_{Wid}E_{cell}}.\] (2)
* _StripWidth_ is the width of the energy deposition, defined as the energy weighted standard deviation in \(\eta\). It is calculated in a _Nor_ window around the _seed_, in the second sampling of the e.m. calorimeter. The formula is \[stripWidth=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{Nor}\eta_{cell}^{2}\cdot E_{cell}}{ \sum_{Nor}E_{cell}}-\left[\frac{\sum_{Nor}\eta_{cell}\cdot E_{cell}}{ \sum_{Nor}E_{cell}}\right]^{2}}.\] (3)
* _EtCalib_ is the calibrated total transverse energy, calculated in the e.m. and hadronic calorimeters, in a _Nor_ region around the seed.

The distributions of _EMRadius_, _IsoFrac_ and _stripWidth_ are shown in Fig. 1 for tau trigger candidates from generated tau leptons decaying hadronically and for QCD jets for two different \(E_{T}\) regions. In the top row distributions for low \(E_{T}\) tau leptons from \(W\to\tau\nu\) decays are compared to background QCD jets distributions, while in the bottom row high \(E_{T}\) tau leptons from Supersymmetric neutral Higgs decays (with a mass of 800 GeV) are compared to QCD background. The top row shows the difficulty in triggering on low \(E_{T}\) taus as the separation between signal and background is not so dramatic; the separation is much better for high \(E_{T}\) taus.

Figure 1: L2 Calorimeter variables to distinguish QCD jets from low \(E_{T}\) taus from \(W\to\tau\nu\) decays (top) and from high \(E_{T}\) taus from Supersymmetric Higgs \(A\to\tau\tau\) decays (bottom).

#### 2.2.2 Level 2 calorimeter calibration

A simple _Sampling_ calibration is used in the L2 calorimeter algorithm for reconstruction of the tau energy. This method is fast (\(\approx 7\,\mu\)s) because it applies a global weight to the energy of each sampling to compute a total calibrated energy, as opposed to other slower algorithms, such as the offline calibration [9], which use a cell-by-cell correction. In the current implementation only two layers are considered (e.m. and hadronic compartments) and the weights are energy and \(\eta\) dependent.

#### 2.2.3 Level 2 tracking selection

The standard L2 track reconstruction [10] is used in the L2 tau triggers.To keep the L2 execution time within budget, data from the Transition Radiation Tracker is not used.

Tracks with \(p_{T}>1.5\,\)GeV are reconstructed in a rectangular RoI of size \(\eta\times\phi=0.6\times 0.6\) centered on the L2 Calorimeter _seed_. The output of the L2 Tracking algorithm is a list of tracks found in the RoI. Within this region, two selection cones are defined, corresponding to a distance \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\) of 0.15 (_Core_) and 0.3 (_Nor_) with respect to the direction of the highest \(p_{T}\) track found in the RoI. An isolation ring (_Iso_) with \(\Delta R\) between 0.15 and 0.3 is also defined.

The following selection variables are then calculated from the track list:

* _Pt leading_ is the \(p_{T}\) of the track with the highest \(p_{T}\). By requiring a minimum \(p_{T}\)  this criterion also effectively requires that at least one track is found in the RoI.
* _Pt Iso/Core_ is the ratio of the scalar sum of \(p_{T}\)s of all tracks in the _Core_ and _Iso_ region \(\sum p_{T}^{\rm iso}/\sum p_{T}^{\rm core}\).
* _N Slow tracks_ is the number of slow tracks found in the _Core_ region. A slow track is defined as a track with \(p_{T}\) below a certain threshold, typically 7.5 GeV/c. The rejection power of this variable might depend on the pile-up conditions.
* _Charge_ is defined as the absolute value of the sum of charges of all tracks found in the _Nor_ region.
* _N Tracks_ is the total number of tracks found in the _Nor_ region.

The L2 tracking selection places requirements on these five variables. The set of requirements can be different for different single tau signatures. The three most important criteria are requiring that at least one track be found with a minimum _Pt leading_, an isolation cut on the maximum amount of energy deposited in the _Iso_ region, and a cut on the maximum number of slow tracks. The requirements on charge and total tracks are very loose, due to the higher number of fake tracks found by the L2 tracking algorithm compared to the more sophisticated offline reconstruction. In addition, the offline reconstruction of single tau lepton final states (e.g. from \(W\rightarrow\tau\nu\)) relies on an unbiased track distribution to estimate backgrounds and extract the number of signal events. The distributions of _Pt leading_, _N Slow tracks_ and _Pt Iso/Core_ are shown in Fig. 2 for tau trigger candidates from generated tau leptons decaying hadronically and for QCD jets for two different \(E_{T}\) regions. QCD jet background is compared to low \(E_{T}\) tau leptons from \(W\rightarrow\tau\nu\) decays (top row), and high \(E_{T}\) tau leptons from Supersymmetric neutral Higgs decays (bottom row). Tau trigger candidates are required to pass different L1 and L2 Calorimeter selection criteria based on their \(E_{T}\). A L2 tau trigger candidate passing the calorimeter and tracking requirements is passed to the EF for further consideration.

### Event Filter selection

At the EF level, the selection follows the offline reconstruction procedure as closely as possible. The EF calorimeter algorithm collects cells in a rectangular RoI of size \(\eta\times\phi=0.6\times 0.6\) centered around theL2 tau trigger candidate. The EF tracking reconstruction is described in [10]. Tracking is performed in a rectangular RoI of size \(\eta\times\phi=0.4\times 0.4\) centered around the L2 tau trigger candidate.

To create an EF tau trigger candidate, the EF single tau triggers execute the calorimeter based identification algorithm of the offline reconstruction [11] in the following way. The cells collected in the RoI are used to reconstruct the direction of the EF tau trigger candidate. Additionally, some very loose criteria are applied to tracks reconstructed in the RoI, and if more than one track is found a secondary vertex reconstruction is attempted. The transverse energy and the calorimeter shower shape variables are built from the cells collected in the RoI using the newly reconstructed direction. Unlike the offline reconstruction algorithm, no noise suppression is applied at the EF. The addition of electronic noise in the calorimeter cells gives a generally small change in the calorimeter shower shape variables. Finally, an overall hadronic calibration [9] is applied to all cells, and a tau specific jet calibration is applied to the tau trigger candidate. This final calibration is derived from simulated samples of high and low \(p_{T}\) tau lepton sources. A procedure using taus from \(Z\) bosons decays and exploiting the correlation between the tau absolute energy scale and the visible reconstructed \(Z\) boson mass will be applied to determine calibration constants from real data [11].

The following variables are used for the EF selection:

* _EMRadius_ is an energy weighted radius, which exploits the small transverse shower profile of tau leptons. The mathematical expression used is \[EMRadius=\frac{\sum_{i}E_{T,cell}\cdot\Delta R_{cell}}{\sum_{ Nor}E_{T,cell}}.\] (4)

Figure 2: L2 Tracking variables to distinguish QCD background from low \(E_{T}\) taus from \(W\rightarrow\tau\nu\) decays (top) and from high \(E_{T}\) taus from Supersymmetric Higgs \(A\rightarrow\tau\tau\) decays (bottom).

where the sum includes not only the second sampling layer of the e.m. calorimeter (as in L2) but also all other samplings except the last one.
* _IsoFrac_ is the energy deposited in an annular region between \(0.1<\Delta R<0.2\) divided by the energy deposited in \(\Delta R<0.3\). A similar expression is given in Eq. 2, where the square regions should be replaced by the annuli.
* _N Tracks_ is the number of associated tracks with \(\mathrm{p}_{T}>2\,\mathrm{GeV}\) found in a \(\Delta R<0.2\) region around the trigger candidate from L2.
* _Pt leading track_ is the highest \(p_{T}\) track among the tracks found in a \(\Delta R<0.2\) region around the trigger candidate from L2.
* _EtCalib_ is the energy calculated in all e.m. and hadronic cells found in the \(\Delta R<0.3\) region around the trigger candidate from L2, and calibrated with the procedure described in [9] and an additional tau specific jet calibration.

Some of the variables used in the EF selection, namely _EtCalib_, _IsoFrac_ and _EMRadius_, are shown in Fig. 3 for tau trigger candidates from generated tau leptons decaying hadronically and for QCD jets for two different \(E_{T}\) regions. As for previous figures, QCD background is compared to standard tau signal samples. Events with a tau candidate that pass the EF thus pass the trigger and are recorded for offline analysis.

## 3 Performance of single tau triggers

### Performance overview

This section describes in detail the expected trigger efficiencies and background event rates obtained from the various single tau triggers available in the ATLAS trigger menu, while combined triggers including other types of signatures is given in Section 5. In addition, the optimization procedure applied to the selection at each level is introduced. The goal is to obtain at least 90% efficiency at each trigger level with sufficient rejection of background.

The various types of samples of GEANT4 simulated events used in this note together with the total number of events and the cross section are summarized in Table 1. It is appropriate to note at this point that the rates reported in this note are clearly affected by large uncertainties, because of the limited statistics available and because the simulation has yet to be validated with real data.

#### 3.1.1 Naming convention

In the ATLAS trigger menu, different single tau triggers are implemented, corresponding to different \(E_{T}\) threshold requirements 3): tau10i, tau15i, tau20i, tau25i, tau35i, tau45i, tau60. For tau10i and tau15i the isolation criteria are only applied at the L2 and EF level. For some \(E_{T}\) thresholds, additional triggers are defined using looser isolation criteria (e.g. tau10). Hadronic isolation at L1 is not applied in any selection. Due to the \(E_{T}\) resolution at the three trigger levels, the actual cut applied on \(E_{T}\) at each stage is generally lower than the nominal \(E_{T}\) to maintain high efficiency.

Figure 3: EF variables to distinguish QCD background from low \(E_{T}\) taus from \(W\to\tau\nu\) decays (top) and from high \(E_{T}\) taus from Supersymmetric Higgs \(A\to\tau\tau\) decays (bottom).

#### 3.1.2 Trigger efficiency definition

The tau trigger efficiency is optimized with respect to generated tau leptons decaying hadronically, where the visible tau momentum \((p_{\rm vis}^{\alpha}=p_{\tau}^{\alpha}-p_{\nu}^{\alpha})\) is in the sensitive region of the detector \((|\eta|\leq 2.5)\) and is greater than the nominal \(E_{T}\) threshold requirement for a given signature. Furthermore, the efficiency is optimized to select those tau leptons which are likely to be selected by the tau identification algorithms of the offline reconstruction software. This constitutes what we subsequently call the tau trigger reference.

More specifically, a geometrical match of a trigger candidate to a generated tau lepton within a cone region \(\Delta R<0.2\) is requested. Generated tau leptons are considered for calculating signal efficiencies only if the tau lepton is also selected by either of the two tau offline reconstruction algorithms [11]: the calorimeter based or the track based algorithm. It should be noted here, that detailed optimization with respect to 1-prong (1 charged pion) and 3-prong (3 charged pions) tau lepton decays has not been performed for this study. This results in different efficiencies for these classes of events, as pointed out in the following sections. Total trigger efficiencies shown in this section are estimated on various physics processes which cover different kinematic ranges. The samples used are therefore specified in the text.

### Energy and angular resolution

The relative resolutions (in %) on \(E_{T}\), \(\eta\), and \(\phi\) as a function of visible \(E_{T}\) and \(\eta\) for tau trigger candidates at the different trigger levels are shown in Fig. 4 for tau20i. The visible four-momentum of the tau lepton is reconstructed from all decay products except neutrinos. The resolutions are rather flat as a function of the generated visible \(E_{T}\), however, some dependence on the distributions as a function of the generated visible \(\eta\) is observed. In particular a degraded resolution in \(E_{T}\) and \(\eta\) in the transition region between the barrel and endcap calorimeters is clearly visible. Due to the inclusion of track information, the angular resolution at L2 is better than that of L1. The \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) of the tau trigger candidate at the end of the EF algorithm execution is set according to the calorimeter based tau reconstruction algorithm, hence the EF angular resolution is slightly worse than at L2 where tracking information is used.

### L1 performance studies

The standard reconstruction of the visible energy of L1 tau candidates (_TauCluster_) reveals a serious limitation when trying to obtain a high efficiency above a given \(E_{T}\) threshold at L1. A systematic shift

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Sample & Events & \(\sigma\) (pb) \\ \hline Min.Bias & 2900 k & 7.0E+10 \\ \hline QCD dijet \(8<p_{T}<17\) GeV & 742 k & 1.74E+10 \\ \hline QCD dijet \(17<p_{T}<35\) GeV & 395 k & 1.38E+9 \\ \hline QCD dijet \(35<p_{T}<70\) GeV & 824 k & 9.33E+7 \\ \hline QCD dijet \(70<p_{T}<140\) GeV & 272 k & 5.88E+6 \\ \hline \(W_{\tau\to hX}\) (filtered \(p_{T}>12\) GeV) & 24000 & 5.54 nb \\ \hline \(Z_{\tau\tau}\) & 23000 & 0.246 nb \\ \hline \(H_{\tau\tau\to hX}(120)\) & 22924 & 0.145 \\ \hline \(H_{\tau\tau\to hhX}(120)\) & 40950 & 0.073 \\ \hline \(A_{\tau\tau}(800)\) & 26250 & 10 \\ \hline SU3 & 22250 & 18.59 \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}\) & 41700 & 800 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: GEANT4 simulated data samples used in the note.

of about 30% and a relative resolution of 33% are observed for the reconstructed energy with respect to the generated values. Therefore other possible reconstruction methods have been explored. The energy reconstructed with the standard algorithm (_TauCluster_) has been compared with other reconstruction methods: (1) E4\(\times\)4, defined as the sum over all towers (e.m. and hadronic part) in the \(4\times 4\) RoI region, (2) Jet\(4\times 4\), obtained as the total energy in the \(4\times 4\) RoI region calculated with the L1 Jet algorithm (which is described in Ref. [8]), and (3) Jet\(6\times 6\). An improvement of 10% in resolution can be achieved with E4\(\times\)4 and Jet\(4\times\)4 algorithms with respect to _TauCluster_. However, a comparison of the efficiencies of the different methods, shown in Fig. 5, indicates that the _TauCluster_ algorithm efficiency is systematically the highest. While these other algorithms that more fully contain the \(E_{T}\) of the tau lepton give better resolution than _TauCluster_, this gain in resolution is accompanied by a loss in efficiency and discrimination, motivating the continued use of _TauCluster_ as the default tau algorithm.

Using _TauCluster_, the rates for a luminosity of \(10^{31}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\) are evaluated by using simulations of the relevant QCD backgrounds (see Table 2). The expected rate including all physical processes (minimum bias rate) is shown as a function of the cut value applied to _TauCluster_ in Fig. 6. The effect of the isolation cut can also be seen in Fig. 6.

The L1 selection used in tau trigger implementation is presented in Table 2; the cuts have been tuned to maintain a high efficiency, and the signatures are all observed to have an efficiency \(>95\%\)4. The efficiency has been obtained using simulated samples of \(W\to\tau\nu\) and 800 GeV Supersymmetric Higgs \(A\to\tau\tau\) events, while background is evaluated using QCD events with two jets with hard parton \(8<p_{T}<140\) GeV. In Fig. 7, the efficiency is plotted as a function of the generated visible \(E_{T}\) for different tau signatures. The rather slow increase of the efficiency curves limits the overall performance of tau triggers.

### L2 performance studies of the calorimeter selection

At L2, the full granularity calorimeter and tracking information is available, allowing a more sophisticated selection of tau leptons. As shown in Section 3.2, the angular and energy resolutions are improved with respect to L1.

The L2 calorimeter based selection of tau trigger candidates is optimized with respect to generated tau leptons that pass the L1 selection and are successfully reconstructed by the offline reconstruction software (offline details are given in Section 3.1.2). The optimization is obtained using simulated samples of \(W\to\tau\nu\) and 800 GeV Supersymmetric Higgs \(A\to\tau\tau\) events, and simulated background samples of QCD events with two jets with hard parton \(8<p_{T}<140\) GeV.

The L2 variables based on calorimetry introduced in Section 2.2 are optimized in the following way:

* Since some correlation among the calorimeter shower shape variables (_EMRadius, isoFrac_ and _stripWidth_) is expected, the three variables are simultaneously optimized. The thresholds are determined by scanning the possible cut values for each variable and choosing the set of cuts giving the lowest background rate for a requested minimum signal efficiency.
* The threshold for the variable _EtCalib_ is determined by requiring that the efficiency becomes flat

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Signature & \(E_{T}\) threshold (GeV) & Emlsol (GeV) & Eff.(\%) & Rate (Hz) \\ \hline tau10i & 6 & - & 97 & 13945 \\ \hline tau15i & 6 & - & 98 & 13945 \\ \hline tau20i & 9 & 6 & 96 & 4823 \\ \hline tau25i & 11 & 6 & 96 & 2822 \\ \hline tau35i & 16 & 6 & 96 & 990 \\ \hline tau45i & 25 & 6 & 96 & 263 \\ \hline tau60 & 40 & - & 97 & 97 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

starting at the nominal \(E_{T}\) of the trigger (see Fig. 8).

The optimized L2 calorimeter requirements for tau signatures and the corresponding efficiencies and rates are presented in Table 3. The cut value on _EtCalib_ increases for higher \(E_{T}\) signatures, as we aim to select higher \(E_{T}\) taus. The shower shape variables, a measure of the narrowness of the shower, are tighter for higher \(E_{T}\) signatures, since higher \(E_{T}\) taus are more boosted and their decay products are more collimated. The three shower shape variables requirements have been optimized to give an efficiency of \(\approx 95\%\), although the observed efficiency values are a little lower due to the additional _EtCalib_ requirement.

The efficiency is detailed further in Table 4 for two typical tau signatures, one with low and one with high \(E_{T}\). For each signature, efficiency is recalculated using as a reference different tau lepton samples reconstructed offline. Either the sample from each tau algorithm is considered separately, or the sample reconstructed by either of them ("OR"), or by both simultaneously ("AND"), is considered. The errors quoted are statistical only. In order to achieve the needed rejection of QCD backgrounds, the calorimeter-based algorithm of the offline reconstruction biases the distribution of decays towards 1-prong decays using calorimeter information. A similar rejection and efficiency is achieved in a different manner using the track-based algorithm, which requires a large transverse momentum for the leading track in the tau lepton decay. Therefore, the L2 calorimeter selection has a high and uniform efficiency for the sample reconstructed offline by the calorimeter-based algorithm, while it is lower on the sample reconstructed using the track-based algorithm in the 3-prong category.

### L2 performance studies of the tracking selection

The addition of tracking information at L2 allows an improvement in the discrimination between hadronic decays of tau leptons and QCD jet backgrounds, although at the cost of a non-negligible loss of trigger

reconstruction efficiency. This loss is most noticeable for low \(E_{T}\) tau signatures, mainly due to the requirement of one leading track above a fixed \(p_{T}\) threshold. Overall, the L2 tracking algorithm is about 95% efficient for isolated tracks with \(E_{T}\) above 5 GeV (for example from \(W\to\tau\nu\)). In \(W\to\tau\nu\) events, however, only 90% of generated tau leptons that are identified by the offline reconstruction and pass the L2 calorimeter selection have at least one track with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}>5\) GeV reconstructed at L2.

The L2 tracking selection of tau trigger candidates is optimized with respect to generated tau leptons that pass the L1 and L2 calorimeter selection and are found by the offline reconstruction software. Details of the offline reference and efficiency definition are described in Section 3.1.2. The optimization is obtained with the standard samples described previously.

The efficiency and rejection power of some of the L2 tracking variables can be seen in Fig. 9, where the integrated efficiency for tau samples and background are shown as a function of the applied cut value. For low \(E_{T}\) signatures, the minimum requirement on _Pt leading_ along with the upper limit on _Pt Iso/Core_ are the two most important criteria. For higher \(E_{T}\) signatures, the upper limit on _N Slow tracks_ becomes more important, as background QCD jets tend to have a higher multiplicity of soft tracks compared to multi-track hadronic decays of tau leptons. The multiplicity requirement, _N Track_, is potentially a useful discriminant for higher \(E_{T}\) signatures, although a tight cut tends to bias the multiplicity distribution of the tau leptons found by offline reconstruction. To avoid such bias a very soft cut is applied.

The optimized L2 tracking requirements for tau signatures and the corresponding efficiencies and rates are presented in Table 5. Aside from the _Pt leading_ requirement, which is tightened with increasing \(E_{T}\) threshold, the requirements on _Pt Iso/Core\(<\)\(0.1\)_, _N Slow tracks\(\leq\)\(2\)_, _Charge\(\leq\)\(2\)_ and 1\(\leq\)_N Track\(\leq\)\(7\)_ are kept constant at values which work reasonably well for all signatures, and therefore are not shown in the Table.

The efficiency is detailed in Table 6 for two typical tau signatures, one with low and one with high \(E_{T}\). For each signature, efficiency is recalculated using different reference samples based on offline reconstruction as in the previous section. Again, the errors quoted are statistical only. For the high

signatures, there is not a strong efficiency dependence on the particular reference sample chosen. For the low \(E_{T}\) signatures, however, the different selections used in the offline algorithms, particularly in selecting 1-prong tau lepton decays, are apparent. Since the track-based algorithm also requires a track with some minimum \(p_{T}\) when applied to these events the L2 tracking selection is quite efficient. The L2 tracking selection is considerably less efficient when applied to events selected with the calorimeter based algorithm, where no such requirement on the tracks is made.

The overall L2 trigger efficiency for various single tau signatures, using the optimized selection described in Sect. 3.4- 3.5, is shown in Fig. 8.

### EF performance studies

As described in Section 2.3, the tau identification algorithm developed for offline reconstruction is adapted for EF use. The resolution in \(E_{T}\) and direction achieved at the EF are shown in Section 3.2, and provide a clear improvement in \(E_{T}\) determination with respect to L2.

The EF selection of tau trigger candidates is optimized with respect to generated tau leptons that pass the L1 and L2 selection and are found by the offline reconstruction software. Details of the offline reference and efficiency definition are described in Section 3.1.2. The optimization is performed using the standard samples described previously.

The cuts on calorimeter shape variables and \(E_{T}\) are optimized separately, in analogy to the L2 procedure previously described. First, the correlation between the \(E_{T}\) of the tau lepton and the \(p_{T}\) of the leading track associated with the tau lepton is studied in simulated samples, and then a combined requirement on these two variables is applied to each tau signature. Finally, the calorimeter shower shape variables are studied, and a further requirement is applied on these variables.

### Combined performance of single tau triggers

After evaluating each trigger level separately, we now present the overall combined performance (L1 + L2 + EF) of the single tau triggers. Figures 11 and 12 show the dependence of the efficiency on \(E_{T}\). The shape of the efficiency curves is determined by the \(E_{T}\) resolution, which is different for the different trigger levels. The \(E_{T}\) threshold requirement of the signature is selected such that the efficiency curve reaches a plateau at the visible \(E_{T}\) of the generated tau lepton greater than this threshold. Since the efficiency turn-on is slowest at L1, the cut on \(E_{T}\) at L1 is set significantly lower than for L2 and EF.

The efficiency is detailed in Table 9 for two typical tau triggers as in the previous sections. In addition to the observations of the individual trigger level sections, one can see that the overall performance for the low \(E_{T}\) tau trigger is about 70% with respect to the reference, while at high \(E_{T}\) it is about 90%. This is due to relatively tighter cuts needed to control the large backgrounds present for the low \(E_{T}\) signature. One can also see that the efficiency at low \(E_{T}\) is low in particular for 3-prong decays when the reference is the sample of tau leptons identified by the track-based algorithm. This reflects the previous observation of Section 3.4, and points to the need for the execution of the track-based algorithm at the EF as well as at L2.

## 4 Trigger timing studies

### Online setup

Prior to first LHC collisions, it is desirable to test the trigger software and data acquisition system in conditions resembling real data taking. There are two type of tests which can be performed: _cosmic runs_, where the detector signals left by cosmic rays activate the L1 trigger, and _technical runs_ where simulated L1 trigger signals are used. These runs allow the monitoring system to be assessed, the algorithm timing

to be measured (although the composition of the input events is not representative of the expected L1 trigger output when real data are taken) and the interplay between triggers to be studied. All studies are performed on CPUs dedicated to timing studies in order to minimize the possible influence of other users on timing results. Each of these machines is a dual-core Intel(R) XEON(TM) CPU 2.20GHz machine.

### Timing results

The CPU time performance of the trigger is a crucial ingredient in the optimization of the trigger. Current design constrains the total execution time per event to 40 ms at L2 and 1 s at EF for the whole trigger. Recent timing studies performed on tau triggers include:

* tests of individual triggers to gauge the impact of increasing threshold levels on the total execution time of the trigger. During this test, each of the tau triggers is run individually (and no other triggers are run at the same time). Although the average execution time of each algorithm remains roughly equal between triggers (see Table 10), the average total time per event decreases as a result of the lower number of RoIs per event for high energy triggers. The results shown in Table 10 indicate that the time performance of the tau trigger should be well within the constraint for total execution time at L2 and EF.

* a verification of caching of data from the liquid argon calorimeter in L2. This test requires running the tau algorithms and other calorimeter-based algorithms (electron algorithm, for example) for the same event. In case data in a given RoI is needed by more than one signature, then the caching procedure ensures that data are requested only once. Recent tests verify that caching is correctly implemented and provides roughly a factor of four time savings in the L2 calorimeter part.
* a timing comparison between the calorimeter-approach and tracking-approach in L2. Currently, the default order of L2 algorithms is that calorimeter data are analysed first and tracking data afterward. The alternative approach should also be evaluated. For the _tau15_ signature alone, using a simulated sample of limited statistics (950 QCD background events with hard parton 35 \(<p_{T}<70\)GeV), the calorimeter and tracking approaches have been evaluated and show roughly equal total execution times, 34.1 and 34.0ms respectively. On a simulated sample of 400 QCD background events with hard parton \(p_{T}>2\)TeV, for the same tau trigger, the tracking approach is

slightly faster than the calorimeter approach, 299 versus 330 ms respectively. The longer execution time on high energy jet samples with respect to low energy ones is mainly due to the longer execution time of the L2 tracking algorithm. This result shows that the L2 tracking selection provides greater background rejection power than the L2 calorimeter one against high energy jets, and therefore suggests that the tracking-approach is advisable for high \(E_{T}\) tau triggers.

## 5 Tau trigger menu

The single tau signatures are the basic element in the ATLAS trigger menu for collecting hadronic decays of tau leptons. Therefore, Section 2 and 3 have been devoted to the selection and performance of the single tau signatures. In this section we describe the full tau trigger menu, with an emphasis on triggers that combine tau signatures with other signatures and the physics goals they address. Such combined triggers are very important for collecting samples of tau leptons of moderate \(E_{T}\) from several SM or even beyond the SM processes. As shown in Sect. 3, the minimal requirement on \(E_{T}\) for a single tau trigger must be high, even at low luminosity, to be allowed to run without prescale factors. A combined requirement of a moderate \(E_{T}\) tau signature with other signatures provides a way to achieve the necessary rejection against backgrounds and avoid prescale factors.

### Combined tau triggers

The following triggers aiming at collecting hadronic decays of tau leptons are currently implemented in the ATLAS trigger menu, in addition to the single tau triggers already introduced:

* **tau+missing \(E_{T}\) (tau+\(E_{T}^{miss}\)).** This type of trigger covers a wide spectrum of physics channels. At low luminosity, when the trigger rejection can be relaxed, the selection of events with \(W\to\tau\nu\) is the priority. \(t\bar{t}\) events with tau leptons in the final state are also selected by this trigger. Such events are characterized by relatively soft \(E_{T}\) range of tau leptons as well as low \(E_{T}^{miss}\). The tau+\(E_{T}^{miss}\) triggers at design luminosity are intended for SM or SUSY Higgs (neutral or charged) searches as well as for searches of new exotic particles like \(Z^{\prime}\). The \(E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger [14] uses the same threshold requirement at all trigger levels. The turn-on of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) efficiency curve is mainly limited by the L1 missing \(E_{T}\) resolution. Since the average \(E_{T}^{miss}\) in \(W\to\tau\nu\) events is low, and the EF \(E_{T}^{miss}\) resolution is better, additional triggers where the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) requirement is applied only at EF are under study.
* **tau\(+\ell\)(+jets)**, \(\ell=e,mu\). This type of trigger aims at selecting events with two relatively soft tau leptons in the final state. Two tau leptons are found in events with \(Z\) boson, neutral SM or SUSY Higgs. In addition, the tau+\(\ell\) combination selects events with multiple leptons like \(t\bar{t}\) or lepton flavor violating processes. The combination of two trigger signatures allows the use of lower threshold requirements than for the case of the single tau trigger. In case of excessive rates for this type of trigger at design luminosity, the additional requirement of jets or \(E_{T}^{miss}\) can be introduced.
* **tau+tau(+jets)**. This type of trigger records events where both tau leptons decay hadronically. While the rejection rate is less favorable than the tau+\(\ell\) case, the sample collected is complementary to the above and both increases statistics and allows the reduction of systematics uncertainties due to lepton identification. This trigger is highly relevant for searches of Higgs boson or new exotic particles like \(Z^{\prime}\) and will also be beneficial for SUSY double tau end point analyzes.
* **tau+jets, tau+\(b\)-jets**. This type of trigger is an interesting alternative for \(t\bar{t}\) studies. At low luminosity, it allows the study of events with low jet \(E_{T}\) thresholds, while at high luminosities it is necessary to reduce QCD and multiple interaction background events.

### Commissioning triggers

In addition to single tau triggers there are single _track_ triggers, highly optimized to select RoIs with one track only. The main purpose of this type of trigger is alignment of the tracker or hadronic calibration. These triggers work in _parasitic_ mode, taking all L1 RoIs passing 6 GeV or 9 GeV with isolation requirements in a given event. In this manner, a sufficient amount of tracks for commissioning can be obtained.

Furthermore, additional triggers like tau15i_PT and 2tau25i_PT are included in the ATLAS trigger menu (PT stand for pass-through). For pass-through triggers, all events that are accepted by the L1 algorithm are recorded for offline study of the HLT algorithms. At L2 and EF the algorithms are executed and their result is stored in the event record, however, their decision is not considered in the global trigger decision. As the output rate of these triggers is equal to the L1 rate, only a small fraction can be recorded, typically \(\sim 0.1\) Hz after prescale factors.

### Tau trigger menu performance

In this section we summarize tau trigger efficiencies for various physics signals, see Table 11, and the corresponding rates estimated on minimum bias samples for \(100\,pb^{-1}\), see Table 12. For the results shown, the physics signal efficiencies are calculated per event, using the following references:

* trigger with one (two) tau leptons: at least one (two) tau leptons at generator level with visible \(E_{T}\) greater than the tau trigger threshold(s) are required. Furthermore, the generated tau leptons are identified by the offline reconstruction algorithms.
* trigger with tau\(+e\) and tau\(+mu\): besides the tau lepton requirement (see item above), the additional lepton is required at generator level to have an \(E_{T}\) greater than the chosen lepton trigger threshold. The generated lepton additionally is identified by the "loose" offline reconstruction algorithm [1], [2].
* trigger tau\(+E_{T}^{miss}\): besides the tau lepton requirement (see item above), the missing \(E_{T}\) at generator level as well as the missing \(E_{T}\) reconstructed by the offline reconstruction algorithms [14] are required to be above the chosen trigger threshold.

Introducing the triggers described above is important for most physics signals with tau leptons in the final state because:

* allows increased statistics
* it is a robust approach against failure or inefficiency of a particular trigger (e.g. due to detector problems)
* allows reduction of systematic uncertainty by comparing results of the same analysis repeated on samples selected with different triggers.

In Table 11 and Table 12 the symbol tau+xe stands for the tau\(+E_{T}^{miss}\) triggers, and j stands for the jet triggers.

### Tau trigger menus for different luminosity periods

According to the foreseen LHC start-up plans, ATLAS will commence data taking at a low luminosity of about \(10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). Over the course of the first year or so, it is expected that the luminosity will increase to a rather high luminosity of about \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). While the input rate rapidly increases during

Table 12: Minimum bias event rates without prescale factors. The cross section value used is \(\sigma=70\) mb, and the peak luminosity used is \(\mathcal{L}=10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). Errors are statistical only.

this period, the maximal output rate of the complete trigger is expected to be constant at about 200 Hz (due to limitations on storage capacities and recording speed), putting a significant burden on the trigger system.

As mentioned in Section 1, the low luminosity period will be used to commission the detector and trigger system. During this period, the focus of the trigger selection is Standard Model physics and events necessary for calibration and efficiency studies. The total sample collected is expected to be of the order of 100 pb\({}^{-1}\). Concerning hadronic decays of tau leptons, the absolute scale of tau leptons and the characteristics and rate of QCD jets misidentified as tau leptons are estimated from simulated data studies only, and need to be verified and understood with collider data. To address this, several triggers are proposed, and outlined in the next section. For each trigger, a method of measuring the efficiency on real data should also be proposed.

The transition to higher luminosity is foreseen to be done smoothly, dropping triggers of the low luminosity period menu which were used for commissioning or with unacceptably large rate, and keeping or introducing triggers without any prescale factors which focus on discovery physics.

The high luminosity menu will be obtained either by tightening the threshold requirements and cuts of triggers present in the low luminosity menu, or adding new triggers, especially combinations of several signatures. Only some ideas for a tau trigger menu for a luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}\)=10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) currently exist.

Given the current background rates, shown in Section 3, the high luminosity menu will include single high \(E_{T}\) signatures with threshold requirements higher than what shown in Section 3 (most probably tau100). Furthermore, the high luminosity menu will be composed mostly of combined triggers like tau35i_xe45, tau25i_e25i, tau25i_mu20, 2tau35i, tau20i_j150 and tau20i_4j50.

#### 5.4.1 Running at \(\mathcal{L}\)=10\({}^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)

The trigger menu for a luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}\)=10\({}^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) covers largely SM physics channels (\(W\rightarrow\tau\nu\), \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\), \(t\bar{t}\)). A fair amount of the bandwidth is given to commissioning triggers (\(<1\) Hz each), which are needed to monitor trigger rates and variables used for tau lepton identification in different \(E_{T}\) ranges.

Table 13 gives the trigger menu proposed for initial data taking, including expected prescale factors and corresponding trigger rates, with overlap between triggers taken into account. The prescale factors are necessary to restrict the total rate from low \(E_{T}\) tau triggers, since there are many physics topics that need to share limited bandwidth. The initial prescale values have been determined from simulation, and will be optimised based on experience with early data. Event yields for several tau-based physics topics are shown in Table 14. In this table the results of only one typical trigger are reported for a set of triggers, corresponding to the one currently considered as the most suitable for the physics signals targeted at low luminosity. However, as physics simulation studies are progressing and as background rates are verified on data, it is likely that the trigger menu will be modified.

## 6 Summary

This note describes in detail the ATLAS tau trigger system, which is dedicated to the selection of hadronic decays of tau leptons. These results are obtained from simulations prior to LHC operations. In the selection at L1, energy deposition in the e.m. and hadronic calorimeters are used, while at L2 and EF calorimeter shower shape and energy information is combined with tracking information from the Inner Detector. At design luminosity, tau triggers are envisaged to be used without prescale factors to select single tau trigger candidates with \(E_{T}\) above 100 GeV. The events with tau trigger candidates with lower \(E_{T}\) will be selected using combined triggers which employ tau signatures in conjunction with missing \(E_{T}\) electron, muon, jet or another tau signatures. The largest contribution to the rate will be misidentified low \(E_{T}\) QCD jets, that are narrow and contain few particles mimicking hadronic decays of tau leptons.

In the first months of LHC operation a low luminosity of \(10^{31}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}\) s\({}^{-1}\) is anticipated, and the data will primarily be used for commissioning the detector and trigger system. At that time the main focus of tau triggers will be on Standard Model physics such as \(W\to\tau\nu\), \(Z\to\tau\tau\) and \(t\bar{t}\) events with hadronic decays of tau leptons in the final state. The typical tau trigger efficiency at low luminosity for generated tau leptons reconstructed by the algorithms of the offline reconstruction is expected to be around 80% for a wide range of physics channels, resulting in a total tau trigger rate of 28 Hz.
