This report demonstrates that the connectors between the TRT end-cap front-end electronics boards are not sufficient as a thermal passage for the heat generated by the electronics. Temperatures well above the specified limit have been measured. A new design with an additional heat duct between the ASDBLR board and the cooling pipes is presented.

Temperature gradients resulting from the power dissipated in the front-end electronics affect the structure of the wheels and may cause mechanical deformations. Taking into account the rigidity of the materials and the estimated temperature gradients, it is shown that none of the mechanical parts will be affected by the thermal stresses and therefore no changes in the mechanical design are needed.

### Cooling system

The electronics of each 8-plane end-cap wheel will be cooled by two loops of pipes, each loop covering 180 degrees of the wheel (see Figure 1-2).

**Figure 1-2 Circuits for the cooling of the electronics of one end-cap TRT 8-plane wheel.**

In the Inner Detector TDR [1], water was the baseline cooling agent for the TRT cooling system. However, in case of a leak, water may destroy electronics due to its electrical conductivity. Because of the geometrical constraints, it was impossible to design any so-called leakless system, where the liquid is circulated below atmospheric pressure. For these reasons, it was recommended to change the coolant from water to fluorocarbonliquids for all the ATLAS Inner Detector systems (see [2]). Fluorocarbons are characterised by very high dielectric constants. They are used in industry for immersed cooling of electronics components. For the TRT, a specific liquid, C\({}_{6}\)F\({}_{14}\), has been selected. It has a high boiling point of 56 \({}^{\circ}\)C at atmospheric pressure. The basic properties of C\({}_{6}\)F\({}_{14}\) are shown in Table 1-1 and are also listed in [3].

From the point of view of heat exchange, the decrease in viscosity and heat capacity with respect to water causes a transition from laminar to turbulent flow. The main concern arising from this transition is the resulting big pressure drops in the pipes and the possibility of vibrations. The behaviour of the liquid under irradiation has also to be considered. Measurements aiming at conclusions on these issues are underway in the framework of the activities of the CERN Cooling Group.

## 2 Heat transfer between front-end electronics and cooling pipes

This section describes the validation of the proposed design of the cooling of the front-end electronics at the outer radius of the TRT end-cap wheels (see Figure 1-1). The efficiency of the cooling has to be investigated in order to avoid hot spots that could damage the electronics. A maximum temperature of 45 \({}^{\circ}\)C on the electronics is specified in [1]. In the proposed cooling design of the TRT end-cap wheel front-end electronics, the heat generated by the electronics will be transferred through electrical connectors, via the so-called active web (see Figure 2-1), down to a conducting aluminium plate, which is connected to the cooling pipes. The cooling liquid will thereafter remove the heat. The question to be answered is whether the heat transfer through this system is sufficient to meet the specifications for the temperature distribution on the electronics, and, if the answer is negative, what can be done to improve the situation.

### Theoretical analysis

#### 2.1.1 Finite element model

A finite element model was constructed in order to study the heat flow and the temperature distribution of the front-end electronics. Using the symmetry of the boards and electronics, it was sufficient to study only one quarter of the total volume (see Figure 2-1). This model consists of 30062 nodes and 23816 elements, with an average element length of less than 1 mm, and was implemented in 3D using the ANSYS1 software. The geometry of the model is shown in Figure 2-2.

Footnote 1: ANSYS is a trademark of the Swanson Analysis Systems Inc [12].

#### 2.1.2 Material properties

The thermal conductivities of the electronics boards and the active web were calculated by the application of multi-layer theory [4] based upon the different amounts of material in each layer (see Appendix A for details). The calculated material properties are listed in Table 2-1. The boards are parallel to the XZ-plane, hence the thermal conductivities have identical values in those directions.

#### 2.1.3 Boundary conditions

According to the ID TDR (section 12.9.6 of [1]), the maximum value for the average power dissipation in the front-end electronics is 60 mW per channel. For the ASDBLR, this means 360 mW per chip, and for the DTMROC 240 mW per chip. The cooling liquid is C\({}_{6}\)F\({}_{14}\) at a temperature of 15 \({}^{\circ}\)C and at a flow of 1.09 10\({}^{\circ}\)\(\mathrm{m}^{3}\)/s. The calculated flow is based upon a five degree temperature increase for the liquid inside the detector. All surfaces, except the ones of the cooling pipe, are treated under adiabatic conditions, which means that heat is removed from the system only by the cooling liquid. This corresponds to the worst case scenario, since any convection will decrease the temperature of the electronics.

Natural convection was not included in the model: no flows of importance will be created by convection over the small distances between the boards (on the order of millimetres). A discussion in Appendix B confirms the validity of this assumption. Considering the relatively large areas of the boards, it is probable that a certain amount of radiative heat exchange is present. Including radiation would be a next step to improve the analysis.

#### 2.1.6 Mesh quality

One of the main concerns in a finite element analysis is the adequacy of the finite element mesh. The mesh has to be fine enough to give correct results. The upper limit of the number of nodes is given by the capacity of either the software or the hardware. In the case studied here, the software, ANSYS 5.4, sets the limit at 32000 nodes. In order to estimate the importance of the mesh quality, the calculations were remade under the same conditions, except for the element length which was almost doubled, reducing the number of elements by a factor six (from 23816 elements to 3918). While the maximum temperature decreased by four degrees, the overall temperature distribution did not change. This variation of 15% of the maximum temperature has been considered as too large for comfort and it was therefore decided to always use the full capacity of the software.

Figure 2.3: Schematic view as in Figure 2.1 with rubber inserted.

Figure 2.4: Temperature distributions with additional thermal connection inserted.

#### 2.1.7 Conclusions

The initial model predicts a maximum temperature on the electronics chips of 71 \({}^{\circ}\)C. With the help of an additional inserted thermal connection, this maximum temperature drops to 42 \({}^{\circ}\)C, below the 45 \({}^{\circ}\)C specified in the ID TDR [1]. According to these results, an additional thermal connection is therefore mandatory to achieve the specifications for the electronics cooling.

### Experimental validation

A thermal prototype of the front-end electronics boards was manufactured for thermal and cooling measurements. This prototype was meant to be used for an experimental validation of the assumptions and calculations made in the finite element model, such as the multi-layer board theory. A confirmation of the accuracy of the model would give the opportunity to investigate the impact of any change in design by modifying the model. Another aim of the experimental measurements was to investigate the need for an additional heat duct between the ASDBLR board and the aluminium plate to which the cooling pipes are attached.

#### 2.2.1 Test set-up

The printed circuit boards were provided by the University of Pennsylvania. Instead of using as heat sources real ASDBLR and DTMROC chips, ordinary heat-producing resistors were used. The voltages over the resistors were separately adjustable, so that the same amount of heat as dissipated from the expected heat loads could be produced. Figure 2-5 shows a close-up view of the test set-up. A more thorough description of the experiment and the data acquisition system is given in Appendix C.

#### 2.2.2 Results

The results from the measurements are presented in Table 2-2 to 2-4. The values are the steady-state temperatures achieved at equilibrium. A cooling liquid temperature of 15 \({}^{\circ}\)C at a flow of 1.09 10\({}^{\text{-5}}\) m\({}^{\text{3}}\)/s is foreseen in the beginning of a cooling loop (see Section 1.1) with C\({}_{6}\)F\({}_{14}\) as coolant. However, since the prototype was cooled with water, the flow had to be slightly decreased to 0.83 10\({}^{\text{-5}}\) m\({}^{\text{3}}\)/s in order to obtain a similar heat-transfer coefficient.

Measurements were made with and without a thermally conductive rubber inserted between the ASDBLR board and the conducting plate. Identical conditions in terms of boundary conditions and cooling were applied. This was done in order to verify the predicted need of an additional heat duct and the results are given in Table 2-2 and Table 2-3 respectively. The measured temperatures support the proposed modification of the cooling system, since the maximum temperature (DTMROC chip) decreases by 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

Table 2-4 shows the measured temperatures as a function of the coolant flow rate. The impact of a change in coolant flow rate is significant only if it is decreased by a factor 10 with respect to its nominal value. As shown in Table 2-2 and 2-3, the coolant input temperature has a larger impact on the cooling performance than the coolant flow rate.

Figure 2-5: Thermal prototype of front-end electronics with cooling pipes and temperature sensors mounted.

One sensor was attached directly to one of the resistors simulating the DTMROC chips as point sources. These temperatures are much higher than the ones measured on the aluminium tape used to simulate the chips as distributed sources (see Figure 2-5). The temperatures of the real chips are expected to be much closer to the distributed source case than to the point source case.

### Comparison between model and measurements

The measured temperatures are in general lower than the calculated ones. Different reasons for this can be identified. One reason is heat transfer out of the box through the cooling pipes. Although they were insulated, a certain loss was inevitable. Another probable source of error is the connectors between the boards. When the finite element model was realised, no values for the thermal conductivity of the connectors were available. Comparing the results, one realises that the estimates have to be verified, either by measurements or by data from the manufacturer.

The experimental validation of the finite element model confirms the strength of the model as a tool, which may be used in further investigations of the impact of any changes in design. Modification and refinement of the material parameters in the model based on the existing measurements is now possible with a higher level of accuracy than before. It is important to recall that the calculated temperatures should represent the upper limits since no radiation nor convection effects were included.

### Proposed design

It has been shown theoretically that, with the additional thermal connection inserted as in Figure 2-4, the cooling of the front-end electronics will meet the specifications of the ID TDR [1]. This was then confirmed by experimental validation (see Table 2-2 and Table 2-3). The thermally conductive rubber is therefore recommended as a baseline for the cooling of the current design of the TRT end-cap front-end electronics.

Temperature distribution between active webs and ring 2

This section describes the expected thermal map of the region between the active web and ring 2 (see Figure 1-1). The study was carried out in order to investigate the temperature gradients on the active and passive webs and on rings 2 and 3. Temperature gradients may cause thermo-mechanical deformations. Since ring 2 is the outer support of the straws which are required to be maintained very straight over many years of operation, any significant deformation might have a crucial impact on the detector performance.

### Theoretical analysis

#### 3.1.1 Finite element model

The finite element model was made in two dimensions using the software ANSYS and consists of 14126 nodes with an average element length of less than 1 mm. The geometry of the model is shown in Figure 3-1 (note that the mesh is not shown in this figure).

**Figure 3-1** Layout of the 2D ANSYS model of the region between ring 2 and the active web.

#### 3.1.2 Material properties

Table 3-1 presents the thermal conductivities of the materials shown in Figure 3-1. The values are calculated based upon the current design. Some properties have been modified to provide a better correspondence with the expected amounts of material, including the third dimension (semi-solid parts in Table 3-1). See Appendix A for further details of the multi-layer board theory.

_Table 3-1 Thermal conductivities_

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline  & Thermal Conductivity (W/mK) \\ \hline Web & \\ \hline Active & 0.2 \\ \hline Passive & 0.2 \\ \hline Aluminium plate & 200 \\ \hline Cooling pipe bracket & \\ \hline Solid parts & 200 \\ \hline Semi solid parts & 90 \\ \hline Glue & 0.2 \\ \hline Ring 2 and ring 3 & 10 \\ \hline Joint between passive webs & 100 \\ \hline Xe & 0.018 \\ \hline CO\({}_{2}\) & 0.01618 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 3.1.3 Boundary conditions

The simulated layout is such that the left hand cooling pipe (see Figure 3-2 and Figure 3-3) is the input one and has a cooling liquid temperature of 15 \({}^{\circ}\)C, whereas the right hand one is the output one and has a cooling liquid temperature of 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The five degree difference is estimated from a scenario where each 8-plane wheel is cooled by two loops of pipes. Constant temperatures assumed on the horizontal parts of the active webs, as derived from the 3D analysis of the electronics cooling (see Chapter 2). In Figure 3-2, the temperatures from the simulations of the original design have been used (35 \({}^{\circ}\)C on the left and 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C on the right), whereas, in Figure 3-3, the case with the additional heat duct inserted has been used (21 \({}^{\circ}\)C on the left and 26 \({}^{\circ}\)C on the right). The CO\({}_{2}\) cooling gas for the straws will transfer heat to ring 2 by convection (see Figure 1-1) with a heat transfer coefficient of 10 W/m\({}^{2}\)K and a bulk temperature of 30 \({}^{\circ}\)C. All other surfaces are treated as adiabatic, that is under the assumption that no heat will exit the system elsewhere than through the cooling liquid. This scenario represents, as usual, a worst case, since in reality some heat will be lost through all surfaces.

#### 3.1.4 Results

In Figure 3-2, the total calculated temperature gradient across the active web is about 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C. With the lower temperatures expected on the webs in the case of Figure 3-3, thecalculated gradient decreases to about 7 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The overall temperature distributions are similar in both cases. For the passive webs, the aluminium joint is distributing heat so that no considerable gradients occur. No significant gradients on rings 2 and 3 are observed.

**Figure 3-2 Temperature distribution from outer radius of straws to active and passive webs.**

**Figure 3-3 Temperature distribution from outer radius of straws to active and passive webs with the additional heat duct described in Section 2.4 inserted.**

#### 3.1.5 Mesh quality

In order to estimate the importance of the mesh quality, the above calculations were repeated under exactly the same conditions, except for the element length which was doubled, reducing the number of elements by a factor four (from 14126 nodes to 3641). The results from the coarse mesh showed temperature gradients smaller by 0.1 degree compared to the finer mesh, and the overall distribution did not change at all.

### Conclusions at the present status

The expected temperature gradient on the vertical part of the active web will cause thermal stresses. Depending on the magnitude of these stresses, mechanical deformations may occur. Due to the obtained temperature gradients (7K), the rigidity of the materials and the limited length of connection between the active webs and ring 2 and 3 (there are 16 webs independently glued to the rings), neither rings 2 and 3 nor the passive web will be subjected to any thermal deformations.

A complete study of the behaviour of the active webs is presently underway, theoretically and experimentally, beyond the framework of this note. Also, in order to shield the TRT from the strong electromagnetic fields in its surroundings, the straw area will be closed by a thin copper or aluminium layer, a so-called Faraday cage. This additional metal will contribute to the overall heat transfer. Further investigation and experimental validation are presently underway. Based upon the results presented here, no changes in design are proposed at this stage.

## 4 General conclusions

### Heat transfer between front-end electronics and cooling pipes

The efficiency of the cooling of the front-end electronics had to be investigated in order to meet the requirements of thermal neutrality and to ensure that no hotspots that could damage the electronics will occur. The question to be answered was whether the heat transfer through the electrical connectors is sufficient to meet the specifications for the temperature distribution on the electronics. Combining a theoretical finite element model with an experimental validation, it was found that the answer to this question is no. The proposed baseline for the cooling of the current design of the TRT end-cap front-end electronics is a conductive rubber between the ASDBLR board and the aluminium plate. The rubber is a solution compatible with the requirements of a rigid structure and of the accurate placement of the electronic connections.

#### 4.1.1 New design

Based upon the above conclusions, a new design for the cooling of the front-end electronics has been developed. Figure 4-1 shows a three-dimensional view of the supporting piece, which joins the passive webs, aligns the active webs and to which the cooling pipes are attached. The grooves have been machined to follow the curved shape of the pipes.

_Figure 4-1 New design of aluminium supporting piece._

Figure 4-2 shows a first prototype of the new design. Thermal and mechanical tests are under way in order to establish the properties of this new construction. A mock-up of awheel will be equipped with the new pieces so that the cooling system may be thoroughly studied. Also the insertion into the squirrel cage will be examined. The results will be documented in a future Technical Note devoted specifically to these topics.

_Figure 4-2 First prototype of new design._

### Temperature distribution between active webs and ring 2

The expected temperature gradient on the vertical part of the active web will cause thermal stresses. Depending on the magnitude of these stresses, mechanical deformations may occur. Given the rigidity of the materials and the expected gradients, neither rings 2 and 3 nor the passive web will be affected by the thermal stresses. Further investigation and experimental validation are presently under way, but not within the framework of this note. Based upon the results and conclusions presented above, no changes in design are proposed at this stage.
