This report presents some results for minimum bias events in proton-proton collisions at LHC energies, generated using PYTHIA6.200 and PHOJET1.12 Monte Carlo event generators. Special attention is given to multiplicity distributions, as well as to the cross section predictions provided by both event generators. Our aim is to evaluate the differences in minimum bias predictions from these event generators, which may lead to systematic errors in radiation background calculations performed using transport programs such as FLUKA.

During the last forty years, the study of high-energy scattering has led to a more complete picture of the constituents of matter and their interactions. The use of accelerators, both fixed target and circular, has proved to be not only a good source of information but an essential tool in the development of particle physics. Collider experiments have been performed with different targets, from ion-ion collisions to hadron-hadron, lepton-hadron or lepton-lepton collisions, each experiment being aimed at investigating as thoroughly as possible specific properties of matter constituents. Most of our information about the structure and properties of hadrons and their constituent partons is based on the analysis of high-energy scattering data obtained through many experiments performed in the last half of the last century [1]. From lepton-hadron scattering data, the weak and electromagnetic interactions are used to probe the structure of hadrons and some aspects of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) - e.g. scaling violations in the nucleon structure function \(F_{2}\left(x\right)\), while from hadron-hadron collisions one may investigate the more complicated properties of the strong interaction [2].

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), under construction at CERN in a 27 km circumference tunnel, will accelerate protons to 7 TeV and collide them with a luminosity of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)[3]. Among the detectors being constructed at LHC's interaction points, the ATLAS detector has been designed to make precise measurements of the momentum of muons outside the calorimeter (for measuring the Higgs particle decays), the electromagnetic particles such as electrons, positrons and \(\gamma\)'s (for measuring \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\)), the missing hadronic energy with a hadronic calorimeter (for identifying SUSY particle decays) and the charged particles inside the calorimeter (for identifying \(b-\) and \(\tau-\)particles, and event topologies) [4]. Besides all these measurements, the theoretical predictions of hadron-hadron interactions at this energy will be continuously tested and, when necessary, improved.

In order to obtain the best understanding possible for the ATLAS detector systems, several studies have been done on the radiation environment of ATLAS [3]. These studies rely on Monte Carlo programs such as PYTHIA [5] and PHOJET [6] to simulate proton-proton collisions at high energies; the particles are then transported through the detection system using programs such as FLUKA [7].

In high energy proton-proton collisions, most events consist of the production of a large number of particles with small transverse momenta (small \(p_{t}\)) with respect to the collision axis. Considering the high luminosity expected to be achieved in the LHC, these low-\(p_{t}\) particles will result in a radiation background which may degrade the detector system performance, especially in the ATLAS Inner Detector [3]. This report presents a study of the properties of "soft" events (also known as minimum-bias events), such as distribution of particles in pseudorapidity, transverse momentum distribution and particle multiplicity for LHC energies. Our study is based on the predictions provided by the two Monte Carlo simulation programs mentioned above: PYTHIA6.200 and PHOJET1.12.

This work is organized as follows: the cross section predictions from both PYTHIA6.200 and PHOJET1.12 are shown in section 2. In section 3 a brief discussion of minimum bias models used in the event generators, as well as the parameters chosen for the event generation are presented. The simulated results for particle multiplicities are presented and discussed in section 4 and, in section 5, we present a comparison of particle fluences for the ATLAS detector. These fluences were obtained by combining PYTHIA6.2 and PHOJET1.12 with the transport program FLUKA2001. Finally, our conclusions are presented in section 6.

## 2 Calculation of minimum bias cross section

Physics in hadron-hadron interactions can be divided into two categories: elastic and inelastic processes. It is also usual to sub-divide inelastic scattering into diffractive (single and double diffraction) and non-diffractive processes [8]. Thus, the total cross section is subdivided according to

\[\sigma_{tot}^{AB}(s)=\sigma_{elas}^{AB}(s)+\sigma_{sd}^{AB}(s)+\sigma_{dd}^{AB} (s)+\sigma_{nd}^{AB}(s). \tag{1}\]

At high-energies, elastic events (AB \(\rightarrow\) AB) contribute less than inelastic to the total cross-section and are usually rejected by the trigger. The dominant diffractive processes (single diffractive, AB \(\rightarrow\) AX or AB \(\rightarrow\) XB, and double diffractive, AB \(\rightarrow\) ABX) arise from the exchange of colour neutral objects and contain large rapidity gaps. The remaining contribution to inelastic events is labelled non-diffractive. In contrast to diffractive interactions, non-diffractive events should not contain any large rapidity gaps and involve a net colour exchange between the two incoming hadrons. The non-diffractive processes are identified with minimum bias physics [8, 9].

Fig. 1 shows in (a) the predictions for the total \(pp\) cross section as function of the centre of mass energy compared with experimental data [10-17] and in (b) a calculated inelastic cross section (diffractive and non-diffractive interactions). The comparison is done for both PYTHIA6.200 and PHOJET1.12 predictions.

PYTHIA generates the total \(pp\) cross section (mb) using the following expression:

\[\sigma_{tot}^{pp}(s)=21.70s^{0.0808}+56.08s^{-0.4525} \tag{2}\]

where the first term on the right hand side is the Pomeron contribution and the second one a Reggeon exchange [18]. In PHOJET, the total \(pp\) cross section is generated through the optical theorem that is corrected for high energies using an impact parameter model [6]. The resulting total \(pp\) cross section is proportional to \((ln~{}s)^{2}\)[19].

Figure 1: A comparison between \(pp\) cross section predictions: (a) Total cross section, \(\sigma_{tot}\) and (b) Inelastic cross section, \(\sigma_{inel}\).

Fig. 1a shows good agreement between the predictions of the generators and the experimental data for energies below those achieved at \(Sp\overline{p}S\). For energies higher than \(800\) GeV the predictions start to diverge at the level of \(\sim\) 15%. At \(14\) TeV the total cross section predictions are \(\sigma_{\it tot}=101.5\) mb and \(\sigma_{\it tot}=118.3\) mb for PYTHIA6.200 and PHOJET1.12, respectively (table 1).

Once the total cross section is known, using the optical theorem (with different corrections in each program), both generators calculate the elastic cross section [5, 6]. The inelastic part of the interaction is then obtained by subtracting the elastic from the total cross section. The inelastic contributions (including here non-diffractive and diffractive events) to the total cross section are displayed in fig. 1b. As expected [8], inelastic events are the major contributor to the total cross section. The pattern of both distributions, \(\sigma_{\it tot}\) and \(\sigma_{\it inel}\), is the same, with the divergences between the predicted cross sections starting at roughly the same energy, but being less pronounced in the \(\sigma_{\it inel}\) distribution.

Figs. 2a and 2b show the ratios \(\sigma_{\it elas}/\sigma_{\it tot}\), (a), and \(\sigma_{\it inel}/\sigma_{\it tot}\), (b), against the centre of mass energy, comparing the predictions for both generators. For the ratio \(\sigma_{\it elas}/\sigma_{\it tot}\), some experimental data were also used for comparison [10-12]. At LHC energy, the predictions for \(\sigma_{\it elas}/\sigma_{\it tot}\) differ by \(\sim 27\)% with PHOJET1.12 predicting a ratio of \(0.28\) while PYTHIA6.200 predicts \(0.22\). The best fit to experimental data leads us to expect \(\sigma_{\it elas}/\sigma_{\it tot}\simeq 0.26\)[12]. For \(\sigma_{\it inel}/\sigma_{\it tot}\) the predictions are \(0.78\) and \(0.72\) for PYTHIA6.200 and PHOJET1.12 respectively (table 1). A better picture of how the predictions for the total, the inelastic and the elastic cross section from both generators, disagree can be seen in fig. 3, where \(\sigma_{\it pythia}/\sigma_{\it Phojet}\) is plotted for a wide range of energies.

Diffractive inelastic events (single and double diffractive) are simulated in both programs. Although different parametrizations are used, both PYTHIA and PHOJET consider Pomeron models to describe diffractive events. The non-diffractive inelastic cross section is then obtained by subtracting diffractive cross sections from the inelastic. The non-diffractive scattering cross sections obtained for each generator were: \(\sigma_{\it nd}=55.2\) mb for PYTHIA6.200 (MSEL=1), and \(\sigma_{\it nd}=69.4\) mb for PHOJET 1.12 (IPRON(1)=1), showing that minimum bias events con

tribute significantly to the total scattering process.

## 3 Minimum bias event generators

At the present time, there are several programs, such as PYTHIA, PHOJET, ISAJET and HERWIG, available for simulation of high-energy physics events [5, 6, 20, 21]. One of their main applications is to predict multiparticle production in elementary particle collisions. This means that these simulators deal with hard interaction simulations for \(e^{+}e^{-}\), \(pp\), \(p\bar{p}\) and \(ep\) experiments. However, these programs also perform other functions such as minimum bias event generation for instance [9].

Minimum bias events are peculiar because most of their interactions involve low momentum transfer between incoming and outgoing particles [8]. When no large momentum transfer is involved in a process, the strong coupling constant, \(\alpha_{{}_{i}}\left(Q^{2}\right)\), becomes too large for perturbation theory to be applied [1]. Actually QCD models suffer from divergent cross sections as \(p_{{}_{t}}\to 0\). However, as presented in the section below, using the multiple interaction model it is possible to extend the use of QCD for minimum bias events (see section 3.1).

Non-perturbative procedures have also been used as an attempt to describe minimum bias events [22, 23, 24]. Some of these models, especially those based on Regge theory [2] and on the

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c c c c|} \hline  & PYTHIA6.200 & PHOJET1.12 & Fit to data \\ \(\sigma_{{}_{tot}}\) (mb) & 101.5 & 118.3 & 110.5 [13] \\ \(\sigma_{{}_{sd}}\) (mb) & 55.2 & 69.4 & - \\ \(\sigma_{{}_{e|as}}/\sigma_{{}_{tot}}\) (mb) & 0.22 & 0.28 & 0.26 [12] \\ \(\sigma_{{}_{inel}}/\sigma_{{}_{tot}}\) (mb) & 0.78 & 0.72 & - \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: PYTHIA6.200 and PHOJET1.12 cross section results for pp collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV.

Dual Parton Model (DPM) [23], have been successful in several experimental predictions. For instance, DPM predictions agree with one and two particle inclusive distributions measured at the CERN ISR [25], with particle ratio measurements in proton-proton and proton-antiproton collisions [26], with charge distributions [27] and heavy particle production in proton-proton collisions [28] and some other measured properties [23]. The Pomeron exchange model [29], derived from Regge theory, has successfully explained the energy dependence in total hadronic cross-section measurements [18] as well as diffraction dissociation and soft interactions in hadronic interactions [30].

Different models have been used in minimum bias event generators. ISAJET and HERWIG were not specifically developed for minimum bias event generation, and have discontinuities in the connections between soft and hard processes [3, section 15.3.3]. In PYTHIA and PHOJET on the other hand, this connection is made.

### PYTHIA multiple interaction model

PYTHIA uses a model of multiple interactions to describe the possibility that several parton pairs undergo hard interactions in a hadron-hadron collision, and thereby contribute to the overall event activity, in particular at low \(p_{t}\)[5]. PYTHIA considers the total rate of parton-parton interactions as a function of the transverse momentum scale \(p_{t}\), assuming that perturbative QCD can properly work out these interactions.

PYTHIA describes minimum bias events using \(2\to 2\) parton-parton interactions, where the differential cross section for partonic processes is given by

\[\frac{d\sigma}{dp_{t}^{\,2}}=\sum_{i,j,k}\int dx_{1}\int dx_{2}\int d\hat{t} \,f_{i}(x_{1},Q^{2})f_{j}(x_{2},Q^{2})\frac{d\hat{\sigma}_{ij}^{k}}{d\hat{t}} \delta\left(p_{t}^{\,2}-\frac{\hat{t}\hat{u}}{\hat{s}}\right), \tag{3}\]

where \(\hat{\sigma}_{ij}^{k}\) is the hard-scattering cross section for the \(k\)th subprocess possible between incoming partons \(i\) and \(j\) and \(\hat{s}\), \(\hat{t}\) and \(\hat{u}\) are the Mandelstam variables. The parton distribution functions \(f_{i}(x,Q^{2})\) give the probability to find a parton \(i\) with a fraction \(x\) of the beam energy inside the incoming proton, if it is probed at a scale \(Q^{2}\). The current PYTHIA version (6.200) uses CTEQ 5L as the default set of parton distributions functions (p.d.f.) for protons [5].

The interaction cross section above any chosen \(p_{t}\) limit is given by

\[\sigma_{int}(p_{t})=\int_{p_{t}^{\,2}}^{s/4}\frac{d\sigma}{dp_{t}^{\,2}}dp_{t }^{\,2}. \tag{4}\]

This introduces two problems that must be solved. The first one is observed at \(p_{t}\sim 2\) GeV. Since \(\Lambda_{QCD}\sim 0.2\) GeV, perturbative QCD can still be applied at this \(p_{t}\) region. However, the interaction cross section exceeds the total cross section. The second problem happens as lower \(p_{t}\) values are used. The small-\(x\) region, where parton distribution functions are still not fully understood seem to rise more steeply than previously assumed, giving us the major contribution to the integral above [5] and, as \(p_{t}\to 0\) the differential cross section diverges roughly like \(dp_{t}^{2}/p_{t}^{4}\).

As the number of parton interactions in a \(pp\) collision is given by the ratio \(\sigma_{int}/\sigma_{tot}\), when \(\sigma_{int}(p_{t})>\sigma_{tot}\) more than one parton-parton interaction is taking place in the event. Similarly, in a hadronic non-diffractive inelastic event with cross section \(\sigma_{nd}\), the ratio \(\sigma_{int}/\sigma_{nd}\) may well be larger than unity. Introducing the concept of multiparton interactions, allowing more than one parton-parton interaction in the event, the first problem is then solved. This mechanism has been confirmed by experimental observations in some hadronic experiments, such as the direct observation by CDF [31].

The problem with the divergence observed as \(p_{t}\to 0\) is solved by introducing a cut-off parameter \(p_{t_{min}}\) given by

\[p_{t_{min}}\left(s\right)=\left(1.9\ GeV\right)\left(\frac{s}{1\ TeV^{2}}\right)^{ 0.08}. \tag{5}\]

The cut-off parameter \(p_{t_{min}}\) can be interpreted as the inverse of some colour screening length in the hadron [32]. Hence, the calculation of \(\sigma_{int}\) depends on the parton distribution inside the proton and on the strategy used to introduce the cut-off parameter in the most appropriate manner. Two strategies are used in PYTHIA to solve the divergences introduced by the extension of partonic interactions down to small \(p_{t_{min}}\).

In the first one, labelled'simple' scenario, an effective cut-off is established at \(p_{t_{min}}\), which means that \(d\sigma/dp_{t}^{2}=0\) for \(p_{t}<p_{t_{min}}\). In other words, a sharp cut-off at \(p_{t_{min}}\) is equivalent to establishing a maximum impact parameter, \(b_{max}\), above which there in no interaction. The sharp cut-off applied to the probability of parton-parton interactions may also be interpreted as a consequence of the parton confinement. In this framework, valence quarks from incoming hadrons carrying a transverse component of momentum \(p_{t}<p_{t_{min}}\) would not be able to overcome the partonic binding and interact inelastically.

Since each incoming hadron is a composite object, consisting of many partons, there should exist the possibility of several parton pairs interacting when two hadrons collide. The program assumes that different pairwise interactions take place essentially independent of each other, and that therefore the number of interactions in an event is given by a Poissonian distribution. This is the strategy of the simple scenario (MSTP(82)=1) [5].

Considering that hadrons are not only composite but also extended objects, partonic interaction probabilities are likely to vary for each reaction. In this approach, called the 'complex' scenario, the probability associated with each interacting parton depends on the assumed matter distribution inside the colliding hadrons. In the 'complex' scenario (MSTP(82)=4), an impact parameter dependent approach is therefore introduced [5]. A small \(b\) value (\(p_{t}>>p_{t_{min}}\)) corresponds to a large overlap between the two colliding hadrons, and hence an enhanced probability of multiple interactions. On the other hand, a large \(b\) (\(p_{t}<p_{t_{min}}\)) means a large probability that no parton-parton interaction will take place in the event.

In this scenario, the divergences at \(p_{t}\to 0\) are corrected by multiplying the matrix elements by a factor \(p_{t}^{4}/\left(p_{t}^{2}+p_{t_{0}}^{2}\right)^{2}\) and replacing the argument \(p_{t}^{2}\) in \(\alpha_{s}\) by \((p_{t}^{2}+p_{t_{0}}^{2})\). This action removes potentially divergent terms proportional to \(1/p_{t}^{4}\), provides a continuous \(p_{t}\) spectrum for calculated interaction properties, and reduces to standard perturbative QCD for \(p_{t}>>p_{t_{0}}\)[5]. The \(p_{t_{0}}\) scale, which is now the main free parameter of the model, in practice comes out to be of the same order of magnitude and also to have the same energy dependence as the sharp cut-off \(p_{t_{min}}\), but is typically about 10% higher.

In order to compare our PYTHIA results with previous minimum bias simulations presented in the literature [9], the setting MSEL=1 has also been chosen. This switches on the subprocess ISUB=95, which means low-\(p_{t}\) production. For these parameters, elastic and diffractive subprocesses are not considered, although their inclusion in the event generation is possible.

### PHOJET model for minimum bias events

The physics models used in the Monte Carlo event generator PHOJET are based on the ideas of the DPM, combined with perturbative QCD to give an almost complete picture of hadron-hadron interactions at high energies. Thus, in order to combine the DPM for soft processes with the predictive power of perturbative QCD, the event generator is formulated as a two-component model containing contributions from both soft and hard interactions [6].

Within the DPM, Pomeron exchange dominates high energy hadron-hadron interactions. The Pomeron exchange corresponds to a pure soft cross section and can be parametrized as [19]

\[\sigma_{s}=a\,s^{\alpha-1}. \tag{6}\]

Soft events in proton-proton collision are described by assuming that the collision separates the valence quarks of each incident proton into two coloured systems - a quark \((q)\) and a diquark \((qq)\), as shown in fig.4. The fragmentation process occurs in the form of two quark-diquark chains [6]: \(D_{q}^{h}\,(x)\) and \(D_{qq}^{h}\,(x)\) are the fragmentation functions of quarks and diquarks, respectively, and \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) are the momentum fraction of the incoming proton carried by valence quarks, with \(x=p_{q}/p_{tot}\).

The selection of sea flavours at the ends of low-\(p_{t}\) strings is made according to a statistical bootstrap model [10]. The DPM does not predict the transverse momentum distribution of partons belonging to soft strings. In PHOJET this distribution is sampled from an exponential distribution [19]

\[\frac{dN_{\,so\,ft}}{d^{2}p_{t}}\sim e^{-\beta m_{t}}, \tag{7}\]

where \(m_{t}=\sqrt{m_{0}^{2}+p_{t}^{2}}\), with \(m_{0}\) being the pion mass and \(\beta\) being an energy-dependent parameter used to connect transverse momentum distributions from soft and hard scattered partons, i.e.,

\[\frac{dN_{\,so\,ft}}{dp_{t}}\mid_{p_{t}=p_{t}^{cut}\to f\,=\,}\frac{dN_{\,hard }}{dp_{t}}\mid_{p_{t}=p_{t}^{cut}\to f\,}. \tag{8}\]

The hard cross section is calculated with a lower transverse momentum cut \(p_{t_{min}}=2\) GeV\(/c\)[19]. From the QCD parton model, the hard cross section increases with energy \(\sqrt{s}\) approximately as a power of \(s\)[19]. The formula for hard scattering cross section is given by

\[\sigma_{h}=\sum_{i,j\to k\,l}\int dx_{1}\int dx_{2}\int d\hat{t}\,x_{1}f_{i}( x_{1},Q^{2})x_{2}f_{j}(x_{2},Q^{2})\frac{1}{x_{1}x_{2}}\pi\,M^{2}\frac{ \alpha_{s}^{2}(Q^{2})}{\hat{s^{2}}}, \tag{9}\]

where, again, \(f_{i.\,j}(x,Q^{2})\) are the parton distributions, \(M=\,M_{i,\,j\to k,l}\) is the matrix element for the hard parton-parton scattering \(i,\,j\to k,l\), and \(\alpha_{s}^{2}(Q^{2})\) is the strong coupling constant [19].

Initial state and final state parton showers are generated in leading-log approximation. The Lund chain fragmentation model [5, 6] is then used by PHOJET to simulate the fragmentation of both parton configurations and colour neutral strings from soft events [11].

Figure 4: Leading order contribution in the DPM.

The soft, \(\sigma_{s}\), and hard, \(\sigma_{h}\), cross sections are inclusive cross sections and the average multiplicities of soft and hard scatterings in an inelastic event are

\[\langle n_{s}\rangle=\frac{\sigma_{s}}{\sigma_{inel}},\]

\[\langle n_{h}\rangle=\frac{\sigma_{h}}{\sigma_{inel}}, \tag{10}\]

respectively. These multiplicities increase with energy and at higher \(\sqrt{s}\) a considerable part of the \(pp\) interactions has more than one hard or soft scattering. The hard scatterings are mostly independent of each other, being related only by the sharing of energy and momentum of the incoming protons.

In this program, eight basic scattering processes are distinguished. The specific process for soft event generation is the option IPRON(I) switched on. This switches on the minimum bias interactions (non-diffractive inelastic interactions) [6]. Again, for comparison to other minimum-bias studies [9] we have not introduced effects of elastic and diffractive interactions in our minimum bias simulations.

## 4 Multiplicity predictions

As we have pointed out above, the simulation of inelastic events and ultimately particle multiplicity distributions in both generators depends on the ratio of the parton-parton interaction cross section to the inelastic cross section. We have seen that PYTHIA and PHOJET simulate the total \(pp\) cross section in different ways, hence predicting different inelastic cross sections. Parton-parton interactions are also dealt with using different models. In this section we study the predictions for particle multiplicities in minimum bias events simulated by PYTHIA and PHOJET using the parameters listed in table 2.

For both PYTHIA6.200 and PHOJET 1.12, 5000 events (_pp_ collisions) were generated using the parameters in table 2. In the cases where there is no reference to the proton p.d.f., we have used the default ones: CTEQ 5L and GRV 94L for PYTHIA6.200 and PHOJET1.12 respectively.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c c c c|} \hline \hline PYTHIA6.200 - Model 1 & MSTP(82)=1 & ‘simple’ scenario & CTEQ 5L \\  & & & CTEQ 5L \\ PYTHIA6.200 - Model 4 & MSTP(82)=4 & ‘complex’ scenario & GRV 94L \\  & & & CTEQ 3L \\  & MSTP(82)=4 & ‘complex’ scenario with NLO & \\ PYTHIA6.200 - ATLAS & MSTP(2)=2 & calculation for \(\alpha_{s}\) & CTEQ 5L \\  & MSTP(33)=3 & & \\ \hline PHOJET 1.12 & IPRON(1)=1 & non-diffractive inelastic interactions & GRV 94L \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Parameters chosen for generation of low-\(p_{t}\) events.

Fig. 5 displays the charged particle density in minimum bias events at various energies (\(dN_{ch}/d\eta\)) as a function of pseudorapidity (\(0<\eta<3.2\)). The predictions are compared to available experimental data.

As the colliding energy increases, the divergences between the models used to simulate charged particle multiplicity also increases. The model labelled PYTHIA6.200 - model4, in which the choice of parameters correspond to the default options in the most recent PYTHIA versions, seems to provide the best agreement to experimental data.

Figure 5: Charged particle density \(dN_{ch}/d\eta\) as a function of \(\eta\) for \(0<\eta<3.2\): a) \(\sqrt{s}=200\) GeV and b) \(\sqrt{s}=900\) GeV compared to UA5 data, c) \(\sqrt{s}=1800\) GeV compared to CDF data and d) \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV prediction to LHC.

Figs. 5 and 6 show clearly how different models predict different results for particle multiplicity at higher energies. At \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV the multiple interaction model implemented in PYTHIA6.200, in both simple and complex scenarios, provides a higher multiplicity for \(|\eta|<8\) than PHOJET 1.12, which uses the DPM for soft event generation.

Figure 6: Charged particle density in minimum bias events at LHC energy: a) \(dN_{ch}/d\eta\) as a function of \(\eta\), b) \(dN_{ch}/dp_{t}\) as a function of \(p_{t}\).

Figure 7: Charged particle density \(dN_{ch}/d\eta\) at \(\eta=0\) as a function of \(\sqrt{s}\). PYTHIA and PHOJET predictions compared to UA5 [33] and CDF data [34].

The same effect can be observed in the transverse momentum spectrum of charged hadrons produced in minimum bias events (\(dN_{ch}/dp_{l}\)) as can be seen in fig. 6b. At low momenta, \(dN_{ch}/dp_{l}\) is greater for PYTHIA but as \(p_{t}\) increases (\(p_{t}>1\) GeV/c) PHOJET becomes greater. This has important consequences for radiation backgrounds and is discussed further in section 5.

One can note that the charged particle density is greater in the low pseudorapidity region (\(|\eta|<4\)), which means that one may expect a greater charged particle multiplicity in the pseudorapidity region covered by the ATLAS inner detector (\(|\eta|<2.5\)) (see fig. 6a). Although both Monte Carlo simulators predict high multiplicity in this region, the descriptions obtained from them disagree considerably in the inner detector pseudorapidity region. PYTHIA 6.200 - model 1 predicts a density roughly 50% greater than that predicted by PHOJET 1.12, while PYTHIA6.200 - model 4 and ATLAS disagree by about 17% and 36%, respectively.

Fig. 7 displays the charged particle density \(dN_{ch}/d\eta\) at \(\eta=0\) as a function of \(\sqrt{s}\) per \(pp\) collision. The simulated distributions are compared to experimental data from UA5 [33] and CDF [34]. The fit to experimental data suggests a continuing steady rise to the charged particle density at \(\eta=0\). The best fit to experimental data is given by [34]

\[\frac{dN_{ch}}{dp_{l}}\mid_{\eta=0}=0.02\,3\ln(s)^{2}-0.25\ln(s)+2.5. \tag{11}\]

PYTHIA6.200 - model 4 again, agrees best with the experimental data up to energies around or below \(2\) TeV. PHOJET1.12 overestimates the fit to experimental data for \(100\) GeV \(<\sqrt{s}<4\) TeV and compared to PYTHIA for higher energies it shows a less pronounced rise. PYTHIA6.200 - model 4 estimates 7.2 charged particles at \(\eta=0\) per \(pp\) event at \(\sqrt{s}=14\)\(TeV\), while 5.8 is estimated by PHOJET1.12. Following the experimental data fit, the expected value for charged particles produced in the central region would be 6.1.

From multiplicity distributions of minimum bias events it seems that data favours PYTHIA6.200 - model 4 as the best description.

### Effect of different parton distribution functions on multiplicity distributions

The effects on charged particle multiplicity distributions caused by the selection of different sets of parton distribution functions (p.d.f.) have also been investigated, particularly for PYTHIA6.200. From the results shown above, PYTHIA6200 - model 4 offers the best agreement with the experimental data among the models discussed in this report. We have simulated charged particle multiplicities in the region of \(0<\eta<3.2\) using the settings for PYTHIA6200 - model 4 for different sets of p.d.f..

In the current PYTHIA version (6.200) the default set of p.d.f. is CTEQ5 L (MSTP(51)=7) [5]. Fig. 9 shows the differences due to the use of different p.d.f sets in charged particle multiplicities at various collider energies.

The results obtained using CTEQ 5L are compared to results generated using the sets GRV 94L (MSTP(51)=4) and CTEQ 3L (MSTP(51)=1). CTEQ 5L is the most recent of the p.d.f. sets compared. It considers some of the latest experimental results in deep inelastic scattering which, in addition to improved precision, have also shown that parton distributions rise more steeply at small \(x\) than previously thought [5, 35].

The \(dN_{ch}/d\eta\) distributions in fig. 8 show that the minimum bias model of multiparton interactions used in PYTHIA is sensitive to the set of p.d.f. chosen. The differences observed are due to the partonic interaction model (see eq. 3) which the program uses not only for hard processes but also, with the appropriate considerations (simple and complex scenarios), to soft process modelling as well. When simulations are compared to experimental data, the use of CTEQ 5L gives the best agreement. Using the set GRV 94L, which is also the set we have used in PHOJET1.12 [6], higher particle multiplicities were obtained. The opposite, lower particle multiplicities, is observed when the set CTEQ 3L was chosen.

The multiplicity using GRV 94L is \(\sim 17\%\) higher and using CTEQ 3L our estimates are \(\sim 30\%\) lower than those obtained using CTEQ 5L.

### Particle multiplicities

The average particle multiplicity per event for all pseudorapidities at the selected energies is given in table 3. Table 4 presents the same information for the region \(|\eta|<2.5\).

Figure 8: Charged particle density \(dN_{ch}/d\eta\) for different sets of p.d.f. as a function of \(\eta\): a) \(\sqrt{s}=200\) GeV and b) \(\sqrt{s}=900\) GeV compared to UA5 data, c) \(\sqrt{s}=1800\) GeV compared to CDF data and d) \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV prediction to LHC.

The differences noted in both tables 3 and 4 agree with the charged particle density in minimum bias events shown in figs. 5 and 6. These differences in multiplicity predictions may have important implications when considering how the radiation background from these particles will affect the detection system.

Differences are typically less than 20%. The only notable exception is muons in the forward muon system, where \(\sim\) 50% more muons are observed using Phojet1.12. The origin of the discrepancy in muon rates has been investigated and found to be associated with differences in the predictions of high-energy (\(>\) 5GeV) charged pions and kaons in non-diffractive events, which decay before interacting in the calorimeter. The corresponding charged pion and kaon energy spectra are shown in fig. 12. This demonstrates that in situations where rates are dominated by high energy particles (\(>\) 3GeV), a more conservative difference of \(\sim\)50% should be assumed.

## 6 Conclusion

The two most widely used simulation programs, PYTHIA and PHOJET, use different theoretical models and predict somewhat different cross-sections at LHC energies, although both are tuned to reproduce lower energy experimental data. The divergencies at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV range from 14.2% in the total cross section prediction to approximately 16% in the particle multiplicity prediction for the full pseudorapidity range, when PYTHIA6.200 - model 4 is compared to PHOJET1.12.

ments (figs. 1 and 2), lie between the PHOJET1.12 and PYTHIA6.200 for energies \(>1\) TeV. We therefore predict that the non-diffractive inelastic cross-section at LHC energies will be in the interval \(55.2\) mb\(<\sigma_{nd}^{exp}<69.4\) mb, where the lower bound comes from PYTHIA and the upper from PHOJET.

From the comparison of charged particle production at \(\eta=0\) (fig. 7), again the simulation predictions are distributed one above and one below to the experimental data fit [34] at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV with PYTHIA6.200 giving higher estimates than PHOJET1.12.

According to [3, 9] the recommended parameters to be used for minimum bias event simulations at ATLAS are the parameters labelled'model 4' applied to PYTHIA6.200 or any other PYTHIA version newer than PYTHIA6.1. For older PYTHIA versions, due to the set of p.d.f. chosen (older than GRV 94L), the recommended version would be the model labelled ATLAS [9]. Our study agrees with the ATLAS-TDR recommendations. However, there are still other options that can be explored in order to evaluate minimum bias events, for example the implementation of different settings in PYTHIA 6.200 or even a Monte Carlo simulator which considers a different theoretical model, such as PHOJET 1.12. We have shown some results of simulations carried out using both PYTHIA 6.200 and PHOJET 1.12. The models present reasonable agreement for simulated properties where experimental data can be used to correct any divergence in the theoretical models. However, at higher energies, such as those to be used at LHC, there are considerable divergences. Some of the results obtained for \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV using PYTHIA6.200 - model4 and PHOJET1.12 are summarized in table 7.

The divergences have been reduced by the implementation of new sets of p.d.f. containing more accurate information about partons inside protons. In this perspective, the better one can understand p.d.f. at low \(x\) limits, the better our simulations will model minimum bias particle production at high energies.

Using PYTHIA6.2 and PHOJET1.12 with the particle cascade program FLUKA2001, particle fluence differences are typically less than 20%. Comparing to PYTHIA, a higher inelastic cross-section per \(pp\) event is generated by PHOJET, which implies in higher rate of inelastic interactions per \(pp\) bunch crossing. We observe that PHOJET's higher rate of inelastic interactionsis compensated by its smaller particle multiplicity per _pp_ event. As a result, the differences in particle fluences obtained by comparing PYTHIA with PHOJET are, in almost all cases, smaller than the uncertainties in particle multiplicities per \(pp\) event.

More simulations should be done, exploring other distributions and particle properties, in order to decide on the best theoretical prediction possible for the experimental data which will be collected at ATLAS. The theoretical models for minimum bias events are still the subject of more accurate development.
