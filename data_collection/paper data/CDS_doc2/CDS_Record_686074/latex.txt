ABSTRACT

A Monte Carlo study of 1-5 TeV electron showers has been performed for the ATLAS barrel electromagnetic calorimeter. Two options were considered: a dedicated preshower in front of the accordion calorimeter and an integrated calorimeter with narrow strips in 1-st longitudinal section of the accordion. The results are used to determine the maximum energy deposition per readout channel.

Physics Requirement

What are the highest energy particles of interest for ATLAS calorimetry? We are looking for new phenomena and have no exact answer. A search of a \(Z^{\prime}\) type gauge boson through the decay \(Z^{\prime}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) is usually used to find the maximum energy deposition per readout channel in the electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter. In one year of running at the LHC at \(10^{34}s^{-1}cm^{-2}\) luminosity, one can reach \(M_{Z^{\prime}}\simeq\) 3-5 TeV, depending on the \(Z^{\prime}\) couplings and on the number of channels kinematically available for its decay [1]. The reach criterion is the detection, in \(10^{7}\) seconds, of \(10~{}Z^{\prime}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events in a narrow \(M_{e^{+}e^{-}}\) range.

The electron energy versus pseudorapidity distribution [2] for \(5~{}\mathrm{TeV}~{}Z^{\prime}~{}\rightarrow~{}e^{+}e^{-}\) is shown in Fig. 1. The upper ends of the electron total and transverse energy spectra for this \(Z^{\prime}\) decay are given in Table 1 as a function of pseudorapidity.

Geometry and Material

We have carried out a full GEANT [3] simulation of electron showers in the barrel EM calorimeter with an accordion structure and liquid argon as the active medium [4].

The main dimensions of the accordion structure in the code [5] are shown in Table 2 for option A - EM calorimeter with a dedicated preshower and in Table 3 for option B - GEM-like EM calorimeter with an integrated preshower [6]. At \(\eta=0\), the total thickness of the active accordion calorimeter is 24 radiation lengths (\(X_{0}\)) for option A with a lead thickness of 1.8 mm in the absorber electrode and 25.5 \(X_{0}\) for option B with 1.6 mm lead. Thinner lead can be used at the ends of the barrel: we used 1.2 mm lead for simulations at \(\eta=1.3\). The useful numbers connected with the lead thickness and amount of material in front of the active part of calorimeter are given in Table 4.

## 3 Granularity

There are two layers in the dedicated preshower in option A: a \(\phi\) layer at radius 141.1 cm and an \(\eta\) layer at radius 143.2 cm. The radial thickness of each layer is 1 cm of liquid argon. The cell size is 1/8 of the tower size. The active part of the accordion calorimeter was divided into towers (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.0245\times 0.0245\)), and each tower was divided into three longitudinal sections. There are 8 strips in \(\eta\) per tower in the first section for option B.

In this Monte Carlo simulation we set up a fine longitudinal subdivision of the accordion calorimeter to study the dependence of the signal on the position of the boundaries between sections. Each tower was subdivided into 1 cm subsections along the radius and each \(\eta\) strip was subdivided into 0.5 cm subsections along the shower direction. The energy deposition in each subsection was stored in an Ntuple. As a result we have detailed information about shower longitudinal profile and can calculate signal values for different depth sections.

## 4 Results

The number of simulated events for electron shower energies from 1 to 5 TeV are shown in Table 5.

The spectra of the highest energy, \(E_{max}\), in any cell of the first or second layer of dedicated preshower at \(\eta=1.3\) are shown in Fig. 2. Using the spectrum of the highest energy we define a "high energy" \(E_{h}\) such that \(E_{max}\) is lower than \(E_{h}\) for 95% of events. Table 6 gives the values of \(E_{h}\), derived from the spectra in Fig. 2.

The values of \(E_{h}\) for any tower section of the accordion calorimeter were derived from similar spectra by the same method. Table 6 gives the values of \(E_{h}\) for tower sections (option A) for three positions of the boundary between 1-st and 2-nd accordion sections. Henceforth we give the section depth along the shower direction.

Table 7 gives the values of \(E_{h}\) for three versions of option B. The simulation shows also that the connection of the 3-rd sections of two towers (adjacent in \(\phi\)

the results on a chosen calorimeter option can be derived by interpolation between values for 3 and 5 TeV.

So in this case the \(E_{h}\) for barrel 2-nd section readout (option B) is about \(3.8\times 0.55=2.1\) TeV. It is less for the central part ( -0.5 \(<\eta<\) 0.5 ) of barrel: \(2.8\times 0.55=1.5\) TeV.

Let us take, as an example, 50 MeV as the least significant bit. This value is slightly less than measured thermal noise for 2-nd section of the Large Scale Prototype [7]. Then the dynamic range is 2100/0.05=42000 or smaller than \(2^{16}\).

If we adopt a 16-bit dynamic range we can ease off our assumptions: we can measure electron shower up to 6 TeV with a least count bit equal to 50 MeV or up to 3.8 TeV with a least count bit equal to 32 MeV.

At the EM optimization meeting in October, 1994 a hybrid preshower with one "presampler" or preshower layer and strips in 1-st section of accordion was recommended for the preshower choice. We have not simulated multi-TeV electromagnetic showers for this new option of EM calorimeter yet, but we hope that combined results from options A and B can give a good approximation for the hybrid option.

After finishing this work we became aware of two important items. First the ATLAS baseline in the Technical Proposal has towers of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.0250\times 0.0245\) compared to what we assumed - \(0.0245\times 0.0245\). This will mean that the maximum energy depositions are underestimated by at most 2%. The second point is that the version of GEANT we were using (the standard version 3.15) has a significant deviation of the pair production cross section from the expected flat behaviour above 100 GeV and leaves out the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect [8]. This affects the longitudinal profile of the high energy showers we have simulated. The main difference will be to lower the mean energy deposited in the first longitudinal section and the preshower by 15-20% and to higher it in the third section by 10-15% for 2 TeV showers. The second section results (where the dynamic range is the most concern) will be about the same. We would like to recalculate the tables and figures here if there is sufficient interest, but it would require significant CPU time.

## 6 Note on a computer dynamic range

Usually in a GEANT shower simulation, an expression (1) is used for a calculation of energy deposition:

\[E_{tot}=E_{tot}+DESTEP \tag{1}\]

where \(E_{tot}\) - total energy in a section or in whole calorimeter, \(DESTEP\) - particle energy lost in current step

Going to the TeV region, one need to use double precision in such calculations, because the difference between \(E_{tot}\) and \(DESTEP\) values can be larger than 6 orders of magnitude.

It's curious that aiming to study as high an energy as the LHC can reach, we need to remember about dynamic range limitations not only while designing the electronics but also while using a computer.
