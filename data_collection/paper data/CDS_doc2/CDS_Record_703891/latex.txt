The potential for observation of a doubly charged higgs produced by vector boson fusion, \(W^{+}W^{+}\to\Phi^{++}\to W^{+}W^{+}\to\ell^{+}\nu\ell^{+}\nu\) is here estimated in the context of the Little Higgs model. With an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\), a sensitivity to the vev of the neutral member of the triplet Higgs of 29 GeV and 54 GeV, for masses of 1 TeV and 1.5 teV respectively, is achieved.

_This note is meant as a supporting document for a global note on signals of the Little Higgs model (ATL-COM-PHYS-2003-040)._Introduction

The Higgs sector in the little Higgs model is generically extended, beyond the Standard Model (SM) Higgs doublet, by the presence of additional scalar multiplets. Since the light Higgs, in this model, has couplings very similar to those of the SM, the search for a heavier Higgs would provide an important test of the model. In particular, a triplet Higgs \(\Phi^{++}\) could be potentially observable since the doubly-charged member can provide a clean signature.

Present bounds from triple gauge boson couplings suggest that [1]

\[v^{\prime}\lesssim 10\%v\sim 25\mbox{GeV} \tag{1}\]

where \(v^{\prime}\) is the vacuum expectation value (vev) of the neutral member of the triplet and \(v=246\) GeV is the vev of the light, SM-like Higgs. Custodial symmetry also constrains the value of \(v^{\prime}\), which could be as small as \(\sim 9\) GeV [2]. This has direct phenomenological consequences, since the production and decay processes of \(\Phi^{++}\) depend on its couplings to gauge bosons, as well as on Yukawa couplings.

Here, we consider a case where the \(v^{\prime}\) coupling is sufficiently large to allow single production of \(\Phi^{++}\) by vector boson fusion and we set limits on the reach of that coupling at the LHC. It must be noted that production via \(W^{+}\Phi^{+}\) fusion is also possible, but this will not be considered, since the coupling of the \(\Phi^{+}\) to the incoming quarks is not known and the mass of the \(\Phi^{+}\) is of the same scale as that of the \(\Phi^{++}\). If \(v^{\prime}\) is very small, single production will be suppressed and the decay \(\Phi^{++}\rightarrow\ell^{+}\ell^{+}\) may be dominant, given sufficently large coupling of the \(\Phi^{++}\) to leptons. Finally, in the limit where \(v^{\prime}\) is close to zero, the doubly-charged Higgs boson would have to be produced in pairs and decay into leptons: \(q\bar{q}\to Z^{*}\rightarrow\Phi^{++}\Phi^{--}\to 4\ell\). Although this case would provide a golden signature, it will not be considered here since the mass reach in double production at the LHC is likely to be low.

In the present note, we evaluate the potential for discovery of the \(\Phi^{++}\) produced by vector boson fusion and decaying into W pairs which decay leptonically: \(W^{+}W^{+}\to H^{++}\to W^{+}W^{+}\rightarrow\ell^{+}\ell^{+}\nu\nu\) The doubly-charged nature of the Higgs boson will thus be clearly manifest.

## 2 Simulation of the signal and backgrounds

The signal was simulated using PYTHIA, process 351, which was meant for production of a doubly-charged Higgs predicted in the Left-Right symmetric model.

The width of the resonance as well as the cross section, evaluated in the effective \(W\) approximation, were provided by T. Han [3]. They are given in Table 2, for \(v^{\prime}=25\) GeV and assuming 100% branching ratio for \(\Phi^{++}\to W^{+}W^{+}\). The cross sections are in basic agreement with those obtained from PYTHIA with the value of \(v_{L}\), the vev of the left-handed triplet, set to 25 GeV. The width was adjusted by proper choice of parameters. The cross section and width are both proportional to \(v^{\prime 2}\). The cuts \(p_{T}>200\) GeV and \(|y|<3\) have been applied. However, to avoid any loss of acceptance, a looser cut was applied at the generation of the signal: \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}>500\) GeV. The cross sections of [3] with this new cut were evaluated with PYTHIA by correcting the above cross sections by the ratio of number of events in the two cases.

The curve shown in Fig. 6 of ref [1] for a mass of 1500 GeV, and for a choice of \(v^{\prime}/v=0.1\) is fairly well reproduced (see Fig. 1). The figure also shows the background from \(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\to W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\) scattering. The latter background was generated with PYTHIA (process 77) with \(m_{h}=120\) GeV, CKIN(3) = 80., \(|\eta|<3\) and \(p_{T}(W)>200\) GeV. The cross section obtained (counting \(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\), but not \(W_{L}^{-}W_{L}^{-}\) scattering), was \(\sigma({\rm backg})=1.5\) fb for \(M_{WW}>500\) GeV, or 0.30 fb with the additional cuts: \(p_{T}>200\) GeV and \(|y|<3\).

The above background is for scattering of longitudinal \(W\)'s only, and is very dependent on the mass of the Higgs boson, here assumed to be light. A much more important

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|r|c|c|c|} \hline Mass (GeV) & Width (GeV) & \(\sigma\) (fb) & \(\sigma\) (fb) \\  & & \(p_{T}>200\) GeV, \(|y|<3\) & \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}>500\) GeV \\ \hline
500 & 6.7 & 14.7 & \\
800 & 28 & 8.7 & \\
1000 & 54 & 4.9 & 5.8 \\
1500 & 180 & 1.4 & 1.5 \\
2000 & 430 & 0.43 & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Width and cross section for the production of the \(\Phi^{++}\) resonance by vector boson fusion, assuming \(m_{h}=120\) GeV and \(v^{\prime}/v=0.1\). The third column, with the applied cuts \(p_{T}>200\) GeV and \(|y|<3\) was provided by T. Han [1]. The fourth column is corrected for the difference in cuts.

Figure 1: Generated resonance using the parameters given in the text. The background is for \(W_{L}W_{L}\to W_{L}W_{L}\) scattering

background arises from the transverse \(WW\) production arising from diagrams with \(W\) bremsstrahlung from quarks scattering by electroweak or QCD processes. This background, which includes the \(W_{L}W_{L}\) background above, was evaluated using CompHEP [4]. Again taking \(m_{h}=120\) GeV, taking the conservative value \(Q^{2}=80\) GeV, and requiring \(m_{WW}>200\) GeV and the transverse momentum of the outgoing partons to be \(>5\) GeV, the QCD diagrams contribute about 340 fb and the EW diagrams 240 fb. Fortunately, this background can be suppressed, as will be shown below.

A summary of the background cross sections as well as the number of events used in this simulation is given below, in Table 2. As for \(qqW^{+}W^{+}\), the \(Wt\bar{t}\) background was generated by CompHEP. The others were generated with PYTHIA. The gauge bosons were required to decay leptonically, except for \(t\bar{t}\), where at least one W was required to decay leptonically. The normalisation factor is for 300 fb\({}^{-1}\).

The detector effects were simulated with ATLFAST [5] assuming conditions of high luminosity (\({\cal L}=10^{35}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)). Electrons are accepted in a range of \(|\eta|<2.5\). Jets are reconstructed with the cone algorithm, with cone radius \(\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+\Delta(\phi)^{2}}=0.4\). An further efficiency factor of 0.9 is applied for identification of each lepton (electron or muon).

## 3 Event selection and results

Because of the presence of two neutrinos, the mass of the \(\Phi^{++}\) cannot be reproduced from the observables of the events. We investigated different definitions of the transverse mass:

\[m_{T}^{2} = (E(\ell 1)+E(\ell 2)+p_{T}^{\rm miss})^{2}-(\vec{p}(\ell 1)+ \vec{p}(\ell 2)+\vec{p}_{T}^{\rm miss})^{2} \tag{2}\] \[{m_{T}^{2}}^{\prime} = (p_{T}(\ell 1)+p_{T}(\ell 2)+p_{T}^{\rm miss})^{2}-(\vec{p}_{T}( \ell 1)+\vec{p}_{T}(\ell 2)+\vec{p}_{T}^{\rm miss})^{2}\] (3) \[{m_{T}^{2}}^{\prime\prime} = (E(\ell 1)+E(\ell 2)+p_{T}^{\rm miss})^{2}-(\vec{p}_{T}(\ell 1)+ \vec{p}_{T}(\ell 2)+\vec{p}_{T}^{\rm miss})^{2} \tag{4}\]

Distributions of the transverse mass, according to the three definitions, are shown in Fig. 2 for \(m_{\Phi}=1500\) GeV. The first one shows a sharper edge at the true Higgs mass and a narrower distribution, and will therefore be adopted here.

The following cuts were applied:

**leptonic cuts**

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Backgrounds & Nb of events & \(\sigma(fb)\times BR\) & Normalization factors \\ \hline \hline \(qqW^{+}W^{+}\) & 100000 & 27 & 0.080 \\ \hline \(Wt\bar{t}\) & 200000 & 78 & 0.117 \\ \hline \(WZ\) & 100000 & 177 & 0.531 \\ \hline \(WZqq\) & 100000 & 0.663 & 0.0020 \\ \hline \(t\bar{t},P_{T}>200GeV\) & 1000000 & 14080 & 4.22 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: List of backgrounds considered, with the number of events used for analysis, the corresponding \(\sigma\times BR(WW\to\ell^{+}\ell^{+}\nu\nu)\) and the normalization factor for an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). For the \(t\bar{t}\) background,the BR is for one W decaying leptonically.

* The presence of two reconstructed positively leptons (electrons or muons) was required.
* At least one of the leptons was required to have a transverse momentum above 150 GeV: \(p_{T}(\ell_{1})>150\) GeV
* for the second lepton, \(p_{T}(\ell_{2})>20\) GeV
* \(\Delta p_{T}^{\ell\ell}>200\) GeV, where \(\Delta p_{T}^{\ell\ell}=|\vec{p}_{T}(\ell_{1})-\vec{p}_{T}(\ell_{2})|\)
* because of the presence of neutrinos in the event, \(E_{T}^{\rm miss}>50\) GeV
* the difference in pseudorapidity between the two leptons \(|\eta_{\ell 1}-\eta_{\ell 2}|<2\).

**forward jet tagging**

* The highest energy jet in the event was defined as the first forward-tagged jet. It was then required that there be another jet, with \(p_{T}>15\) GeV and in the opposite hemisphere: \(\eta_{j1}\times\eta_{j2}<0\). The jet with highest energy, satisfying this condition was considered to be the second forward-tagged jet. The difference in pseudorapidity between the two jets was required to be: \(|\eta_{j1}-\eta_{j2}|>5\). The first tagged jet was required to have energy above 200 GeV and the second above 100 GeV.

Fig. 3 shows the distributions for the variables used in the selection, for the signal and the most important background (\(W^{+}W^{+}qq\)), with successive application of the cuts. Table 3 shows the number of events remaining after the cuts are applied successively, for a luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Figure 2: Distributions in transverse mass reconstructed for the case \(m_{\Phi}=1500\) GeV, as defined in eqs.( 2)-( 4).

Fig. 4 shows the expected transverse mass distributions for \(\Phi^{++}\) resonances of mass 1.0 and 1.5 TeV together with backgrounds after all cuts. To evaluate the significance of an observed signal, we consider events with reconstructed transverse mass greater than 700 GeV and 1000 GeV for the cases \(m_{\Phi}=1000\) GeV and \(m_{\Phi}=1500\) GeV, respectively. The number of events in these mass regions is given in the last lines of Table 3.

Figure 3: Distributions of variables used for the selection of events, as described in the text, after normalization to an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). The signal is in red (dark line) and the \(W^{+}W^{+}qq\) background in blue (lighter line).

* If \(m_{\Phi}=1000\) GeV, \(m_{T}>700\) GeV, the signal to background is \(S/B=7.5/4.1=1.8\)
* If \(m_{\Phi}=1500\) GeV, \(m_{T}>1000GeV\), the signal to background is \(S/B=2.1/1.1=2\)

Requiring at least 10 events and a value of \(S/\sqrt{B}>5\) to claim discovery, we conclude that the cross sections for discovery, with \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}>500\) GeV, are:

\[\sigma_{5}(m_{\Phi}=1000)=7.8\ \ \mbox{fb} \tag{5}\] \[\sigma_{5}(m_{\Phi}=1500)=7.5\ \ \mbox{fb} \tag{6}\]

for an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). Since the cross section is proportional to \(v^{\prime 2}\), this implies that for a resonance at 1000 GeV or 1500 GeV, the sensitivity to \(v^{\prime}\) is \(v^{\prime}>29\) GeV or \(v^{\prime}>54\) GeV, respectively. These values are higher than would be reasonably expected [1], as mentioned in the introduction.

The signal could be augmented by the search for \(\Phi^{--}\). However, at the LHC, both signal and backgrounds would be increased by only a factor of \(\sim 33\%\). This has not been accounted for, here.

Systematic errors can further affect the sensitivity:

* The dominant background is \(WWqq\). As mentioned in Sect. 2, it was generated with CompHEP. An uncertainty in the level of this background arises from the choice of \(Q^{2}\). With \(Q^{2}=\sqrt{\hat{s}}\), the cross section would be reduced by a factor of \(\sim 2\) with respect to the case \(Q^{2}=m_{W}^{2}\) adopted here.
* The \(t\bar{t}\) background is absent (see Table 3), but the statistical error is large, since the normalisation factor is 4.2, as shown in Table 2 (\(\times 0.9^{2}\) for the two-lepton efficiency factor). Nevertheless, other cuts, known to be efficient again \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds, such as central jet veto, or a slightly higher cut in the second lepton transverse momentum, could be applied, if necessary, without significant loss of signal.
* The detector response and efficiencies at high energies have to be well understood. The signal is a transverse mass, which appears as a broad bump over a background tail which much be well simulated.

Table 3: Number of events remaining after successive application of cuts, for an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\)Conclusion

The potential for discovery of the doubly charged member of the triplet Higgs, predicted in the little Higgs model has been studied for the mode where it is produced singly by vector boson fusion, assuming that it couples dominantly to vector bosons: \(W^{+}W^{+}\to\Phi^{++}\to W^{+}W^{+}\), and where the two \(W^{\prime}s\) in the final state decay leptonically. The number of events is low and the signal is a transverse mass, making observation of the signal difficult, even if present. With an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\), a sensitivity to the vev of the neutral member of the triplet Higgs of 29 GeV and 54 GeV for masses of 1 TeV and 1.5 TeV respectively, is achieved.
