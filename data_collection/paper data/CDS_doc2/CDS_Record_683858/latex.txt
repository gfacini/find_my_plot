**Abstract**

Channels with multi-b-jet final states are very important in the discovery strategies for the Higgs boson search in ATLAS experiment at LHC [1]. Excellent jets reconstruction efficiencies and mass resolution capability of the di-jet system are crucial aspects of the detector performance for the signal observability in these channels.

Full simulation and reconstruction of the four promising channels with b-jets in final states is performed: \(WH\), \(t\bar{t}H\) with \(H\to b\bar{b}\) and \(A\to Zh\), \(H\to hh\) with \(h\to b\bar{b}\). These channels are used as benchmark ones to study: mass resolutions and acceptance in the mass window expected for the different complexity of events, level of combinatorial background from signal itself and universality of the algorithms used for jets reconstruction and energy calibration at the different energy/mass scale.

Equivalently important aspect of this study is to verify applicability of the fast detector simulation for studying signal and background rates for the above channels. For that reason the detailed comparisons of the expected efficiencies and acceptances in full and fast simulations are shown at the different stages of the selection procedures. In general good agreement is found between results obtained in both ways, what validates several physics studies presented in [1] which have been performed with the fast simulation of ATLAS detector [2].

Introduction

Channels with multi-b-jet final states are very important in the discovery strategies of the Higgs boson search in ATLAS experiment at LHC [1].

* In the low mass range, below 130 GeV, discovery potential relays on the \(t\bar{t}H\) production. This channel is equivalently performant for searches of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs and of the lightest Higgs boson in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Selection criteria require reconstruction of both top quarks, in the hadronic and leptonic decay mode. The signal evidence is expected to show up as a peak in the \(m_{bb}\) distribution of the spectator di-b-jet system. Just four identified b-jets are required in the final state accompanied by an isolated lepton and di-jet system consistent with the hadronic W-boson decay.
* Much less promising, but nevertheless used as a benchmark channel for optimising detector performance, is the WH production. Here, two b-jets from Higgs decay are required to be accompanied by the isolated lepton from W-boson decay. This channel is used as a benchmark one for two mass values, \(m_{H}~{}=~{}100\) GeV and \(m_{H}~{}=~{}400\) GeV. The second mass point is not expected to be accessible in WH production, however both give good benchmark scenario for studying in the wide range the jets transverse momenta, the energy/mass scale calibration, di-jets system resolution and b-tagging capability.
* The \(A\to Zh\), \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\), \(h\to b\bar{b}\), is promising for the MSSM Higgs boson discovery at low \(\tan\beta\) and for masses below top-pair threshold (350 GeV). Here it is studied for the benchmark values of \(m_{A}=300\) GeV, \(m_{h}=80\) GeV. Search strategies require reconstructed \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) decay and two b-tagged jets. Reconstruction of the \(h\to b\bar{b}\) mass peak and \(A\to Zh\) peak is crucial for the possible observability of this signal.
* The \(H\to hh\to 4b\) is promising in the similar range of the MSSM parameter space. Here it is studied for the same spectrum of the Higgs boson masses: \(m_{H}=300\) GeV and \(m_{h}=80\) GeV. Search strategies require four b-tagged jets. Reconstruction of the double \(h\to b\bar{b}\) decay and \(H\to hh\) peak is crucial for the possible observability of this signal.

For all above channels, in addition to the excellent b-tagging, the good resolution of the reconstructed mass distribution is a key element for discovery of the Higgs boson. The expected resolution and acceptance of the selection criteria is studied here with the full and fast simulation of the ATLAS detector. The same generated events were used in both simulation chains to allow event-by-event studies. Such comparison qualifies credibility of the background studies done in most cases with the fast simulation only. As the above processes are characterised by the different level of the complexity of events, mass of the resonances and jets energy scale, all together they form a representative sample for quantifying expected performance of the detector.

## 2 The \(WH\to l\nu b\bar{b}\) channel

The \(H\to b\bar{b}\) decay mode is a dominant one for the Higgs masses below mass of the W-boson pair, with a branching ratio of \(\sim 90\%\). The observation of this characteristic signature would be important for both the Higgs boson discovery and for the determination of the nature of any resonance observed in this mass region. The associated production with \(W\) or \(t\bar{t}\) pair, giving an isolated lepton as an additional signature remains as the only possible production process to observe the signal in the \(b\bar{b}\) decay mode above the huge QCD two-jet background. The Higgs boson signal might be just reconstructed as a peak in the invariant jet-jet mass spectrum of tagged b-jets.

Prospects for the observability of the Higgs boson in the WH associated production has been studied already for ATLAS TP [3] and Physics TDR [1]. Although the expected sensitivity is rather weak, below \(5\sigma\) for this channel alone, it serves as an excellent benchmark process for studying ATLAS detector capability for b-jets tagging and di-b-jets system reconstruction.

### Reconstruction of the \(m_{H}=100\ GeV\) signal

A sample of \(WH\) events was simulated with the full and fast simulation of the ATLAS detector. Details on the reconstruction and calibration procedure can be found in Appendix A and B. Selection criteria, foreseen by the searches strategies, require presence of an isolated lepton with \(p_{T}\ >\ 20\) GeV, two b-tagged jets with \(p_{T}\ >\ 15\) GeV and veto on any additional jet in the full rapidity range. Table 1 shows sequential and cumulative acceptances of the above selection criteria. In general good agreement, on the level of \(15\%\), is found between results obtained from both simulations streams.

Figure 1 and 2 show reconstructed peak in the \(m_{bb}\) distribution for events from the fast and full simulation passing selection criteria as specified in Table 1.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||c|c|} \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{|c||}{Sequential accept.} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Cumulative accept.} \\ Selection & full & fast & full & fast \\ \hline \hline \(n_{jet}\ \geq\ 2\) & 72\% & 70\% & 72\% & 70\% \\ \hline
2 b-jets (perfect b-tagging) & 61\% & 62\% & 44\% & 43\% \\ \hline
1 lepton with \(p_{T}\ >\ 20\ GeV\) & 66\% & 66\% & 29\% & 29\% \\ and \(|\eta|\ <\ 2.5\) & & & & \\ \hline Jet veto & 56\% & 57\% & 16\% & 16\% \\ \hline Mass window \(m_{bb}\ =\ 100\ \pm\ 20\) GeV & 82\% & 86\% & 13\% & 15\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: _Acceptances of selection criteria for \(WH\), \(H\to b\bar{b}\) events with \(m_{H}\ =\ 100\ GeV\), with the full and fast simulation of ATLAS detector. In full simulation noise is added and \(1\sigma\)(noise) cut is applied (see below)._Figure 1: _The \(m_{bb}\) distribution of di-b-jet system, reconstructed for events processed with fast simulation (left plot) and full simulation (right plot) of the detector. Generated angle is used for calculating the \(m_{bb}\) mass. Full simulation with noise added and \(1\sigma\) cut applied._

Figure 2: _Same as Fig. 1 but using reconstructed angle of the di-b-jet system._

Distribution is shown for two steps of the reconstruction procedure:

* calibrated jet energy is used while keeping information of the generated angle between two b-quarks in the calculation of the mass of di-jet system (Fig. 1).
* calibrated jet energy and reconstructed angle between two jets are used in the calculation of the mass of the di-jet system (Fig. 2).

The reconstructed peak position of the distribution reproduce the value of the generated Higgs mass with precision of 1% (resp. 3%) if the generated angle (resp. reconstructed angle) is used for the calculation of the mass of the di-jet system. Results are very well consistent between the full and fast simulation of the detector. This is a very encouraging fact, that using the same physics calibration function for jets reconstructed with the fast and full simulation of the detector gives very close results on the position and expected resolution of the mass peak. Better precision on the reconstructed mass scale could be achieved with the more detailed work on the calibration function and resolution of the reconstructed jet axis. Such work was however outside the scope of this study.

The resolution from the full simulation is about 15% worse then the resolution from fast simulation, with only slightly higher fraction of the non-gaussian tail. Within the mass window of \(\pm 20\) GeV (that corresponds to \(\pm 2\sigma\), assuming 10% mass resolution) cumulative acceptance of 13% (resp. 15%) is achieved with the full (resp. fast) simulation. These include acceptance for 2 b-labelled jets, isolated single lepton 2, jet-veto and mass window.

Footnote 2: Isolated single lepton (lepton track and isolation selection) is reconstructed with the fast simulation only.

To simulate more realistically performance of the detector an electronic noise should be added to energy deposition in each cell of the calorimeter. This noise comes from 200000 channels of electromagnetic calorimeter and it might spoil measurements of quantities, which use information from many cells like jet energy and \(E_{T}^{miss}\). To decrease the effect of the electronic noise the threshold value is used on the cell energy deposition. Parametrised noise is added to each cell with Gaussian distribution with \(\sigma\)(noise) corresponding to the characteristic of the electronics. Afterwards only cells with energy greater than the threshold value, expressed in \(\sigma\)(noise), are counted for the reconstruction of the jet energies. Effects of the electronic noise for few choices of the threshold value are summarised in Table 2.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{acceptance} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\(m_{bb}\)} \\ \cline{2-5}  & \(\geq 2\) jets & \(\geq 2\) b-labelled & \(\sigma(GeV)\) & \% in \(\pm 2\sigma\) \\ \hline FAST & 70\% & 62\% & 9.3 & 81\% \\ \hline FULL, no noise & 72\% & 61\% & 11.4 & 90\% \\ \hline FULL, noise added & 73\% & 62\% & 12.4 & 91\% \\ no threshold & & & & \\ \hline FULL, noise added & 72\% & 61\% & 10.8 & 89\% \\ \(1\sigma\) threshold & & & & \\ \hline FULL, noise added & 68\% & 60\% & 10.6 & 91\% \\ \(2\sigma\) threshold & & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Table 2: _Effects of various thresholds on calorimeter cell energy._With increasing \(E_{T}^{cell}\) threshold the resolution of the \(m_{bb}\) distributions improves but acceptance falls down. Choice of the \(1\sigma\)(noise) threshold seems to be a good compromise and is used in Table 1 and the studies presented in Sections 3-5. See also Appendix A for details on jet reconstruction in calorimeter.

### Reconstruction of the \(m_{H}=400\ GeV\) signal

The Higgs boson will be not accessible in the associated WH production for the mass of 400 GeV. Nevertheless, it is used as the benchmark signature for studying reconstruction performance in the wider range of the energy/mass scale.

Fig. 3 shows comparison of the distributions for the transverse momenta of the b-quarks from Higgs decay, \(p_{T}^{b-quark}\) and the cone separation between pair of the b-quarks for the Higgs mass of 100 GeV and 400 GeV. With the Higgs mass increasing from 100 GeV to 400 GeV the average transverse momentum of b-jets rises from 56 GeV to 136 GeV. The peak position of the distribution of the cone separation of the pair of b-jets is shifted towards back-to-back configuration, from \(\Delta R_{bb}\ =\ 2.7\) to \(\Delta R_{bb}\ =\ 3.0\).

With the same calibration as for the \(m_{H}\ =\ 100\) GeV case precision on the reproduction of the invariant mass \(m_{bb}\) peak position is better than 3% (see Fig. 4 for generated angle between b-jets and Fig. 5 for reconstructed angle between b-jets, both obtained with jet veto cut). The amount of tails outside the \(\pm 2\sigma\) window is of 25-30%. Invariant mass distributions are asymmetric and have large tails for low mass values due to final state radiation, and we tried to overcome this problem adding so called "neighbour" jets (see later). Expected \(m_{bb}\) resolution is better then 10% of the mass of the Higgs, ie. about 25 GeV (resp. 33 GeV) for the fast (resp. full simulation case). In \(\pm\ 2\sigma\) GeV mass window about 75% of events from the fast simulation and about 70% from the full simulation is

2 b-jets (perfect b-tagging) & 72\% & 78\% & 72\% & 78\% \\ \hline Mass window & & & & \\ \(m_{bb}~{}=~{}400~{}\pm~{}70\) GeV (full) & 70\% & – & 50\% & – \\ \(m_{bb}~{}=~{}400~{}\pm~{}50\) GeV (fast) & – & 75\% & – & 58\% \\ \(m_{bb}~{}=~{}400~{}\pm~{}80\) GeV & 76\% & 88\% & 55\% & 69\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Adding jets present in a given cone around original b-jet might improve mass peak resolution as one can expect that these jets are produced via FSR from original b-quark. On the Fig.6 the \(m_{bb}\) distribution is presented obtained from two b-jets and all jets in cone \(\Delta R=1.0\) (for fast simulation) and \(\Delta R=0.9\) (for full one) around each b-jet added. Additional jet veto on existence of jets out of the given cones is used. One can notice that low-mass tail does not decrease significantly, peak becomes more symmetric but also high-mass tail, which does not belong to the peak, rises.

To keep reliable shape of the mass distribution the value of the cone should vary between 0.8 and 1.4. For cones larger than 1.4 (for full simulation this maximal value is even smaller) the mass resolution degrades significantly and high-mass tails become unacceptably large.

Prospects for the observability of the Higgs boson in the \(t\bar{t}H\) associated production has been studied already for ATLAS TP [3] and Physics TDR [1]. The expected sensitivity is very promising, above \(5\sigma\) for an integrated luminosity of \(100fb^{-1}\) for this channel alone and Higgs mass below \(120\) GeV.

The selection procedure is rather complicated. It requires four b-tagged jets (from top-quarks and Higgs decay) accompanied by an isolated lepton and di-jet pair consistent with the mass of W-boson. Both semileptonic and hadronic decays of top-quarks are required to be fully reconstructed. Evidence of the Higgs boson is searched for as a peak in the \(m_{bb}\) spectrum of remaining b-quarks.

A sample of 5000 events of generated \(t\bar{t}H\) process was simulated with the full and fast simulation of the ATLAS detector. For this channel only jets were reconstructed from the full simulation of the detector. The semileptonic decay of one of the W-boson was reconstructed from the fast simulation only in both fast and full simulation streams.

Sequential steps of the selection procedure are as following [10]:

* Require at least 6 reconstructed jets in rapidity range \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.5\) with \(p_{T}~{}>~{}20\) GeV, four of them identified as b-jets. They have to be accompanied by isolated lepton with \(p_{T}~{}>~{}20\) GeV.
* Exists solution for the \(W\to\ell\nu\) mass equation which allows to reconstruct semileptonic W decay (longitudinal momentum of neutrino calculated from transverse missing energy). In both simulation streams only information from fast reconstruction is used.
* Exists di-jet system of the non-b-tagged jets consistent with the W-boson hadronic decay (Fig. 7).
* After optimising matching of the b-jets with the existing combinations of the \(W\to jj\) and \(W\to\ell\nu\) and recalibrating \(m_{jj}\) to W-mass, require both top-quarks being reconstructed inside the respective mass windows (Fig. 9 and Fig. 8).
* Reconstructed mass of the remaining pair of b-jets in the mass window (Fig. 10).

Table 4 collects partial and cumulative acceptances of the selection procedure. In total fast simulation gives results being 5%-10% better in sense of acceptances after cuts. Obtained resolutions for top-pair reconstruction are in both cases better than 10% of the top-quark mass, on the level of 5% \(m_{t}\). This is understandable as the best combinations with two out of four b-jets is always searched for. As the dominant background to this channel is the \(t\bar{t}\) production similar effect is expected also for the reconstruction of the background events.

This 10% difference in the estimated total efficiency still indicates good agreement between full and fast simulations. The amount of expected tails is also systematically by 3% to 10% worse with the full simulation for each of the reconstructed resonances.

A similar lost in acceptance should be observed for the top-pair reconstruction with the full simulation in the \(t\bar{t}\) background being dominant background here. These would lead to the significance (\(S/\sqrt{B}\)) being lower only by 5% if estimated with the full simulation.

From Table 4 one can see that fast and full simulation gives the same results with accuracy about 10%, what is very important for so difficult channel with many cuts.

In fast simulation is has been checked that real b-tagging performance (with b-tagging efficiency \(\epsilon_{b}=50\%\) to \(60\%\)) does not spoil significantly mass resolution and acceptances of the cuts. One can expect the same for full simulation however due to small available statistics of fully simulated events it cannot be checked for this channel, as just the first cut on existence of 4 b-jets would leave only 13% of initially available events.

## 4 The \(A\to Zh\) channel

The \(A\to Zh\to 2\ell 2b\) is promising for the MSSM scenario with small \(\tan\beta\) and Higgs mass below threshold for the \(A\to t\bar{t}\) decay. Here it is studied for the following spectrum of the Higgs boson masses: \(m_{A}=300\) GeV and \(m_{h}=80\) GeV. Search strategies require reconstruction of Z-boson leptonic decay; two b-tagged jets; reconstruction of the h\(\to b\bar{b}\) decay and reconstruction of the \(A\to Zh\) decay.

Leptonic decay of Z-boson is reconstructed only with the fast simulation of the detector. Resolution obtained from the fast simulation for \(Z\to\ell\ell\) channel agrees well with that one expected from the full simulation of the detector [1]. Therefore results obtained on the reconstruction of the resonant \(m_{\ell\ell bb}\) distribution with this mixed full/fast reconstruction should be very close to the one expected with the full reconstruction only.

The following selection is foreseen:

* Reconstructed Z-boson leptonic decay from two isolated lepton with \(p_{T}~{}>~{}20\) GeV.
* At least two jets, reconstructed with \(p_{T}~{}>~{}15\) GeV and identified as b-jets.
* The mass of the \(bb\) pair within mass window \(m_{bb}~{}=~{}m_{h}~{}\pm~{}18\) GeV for fast simulation and full simulation.
* The \(m_{\ell\ell bb}\) invariant mass within mass window \(m_{\ell\ell bb}~{}=~{}m_{H}~{}\pm~{}20\) GeV, after applying the h-boson mass constraint to pair of b-tagged jets, and Z-boson mass constraint to pair of electrons.

Dominant background for this channel is \(Zb\bar{b}\) and other contributing backgrounds are \(ZZ\),\(Zjj\) and \(t\bar{t}\).

The \(H\to hh\) channel

The \(H\to hh\to 4b\) is promising for the MSSM scenario with small \(\tan\beta\) and Higgs mass below threshold for \(H\to t\bar{t}\) decay. Here it is studied for the following spectrum of the Higgs boson masses: \(m_{H}=300\) GeV and \(m_{h}=80\) GeV. Search strategies require four b-tagged jets; reconstruction of the double \(h\to b\bar{b}\) decay and reconstruction of the \(H\to hh\) decay. The jet spectrum in this channel is relatively hard, with an average \(p_{T}\) of 100 GeV for the hardest and 36 GeV for the fourth jet. As the dominant background comes from continuum QCD multi-b-jet production, optimised resolution of the resonant peaks (in \(m_{bb}\) and \(m_{bbbb}\) distributions) and relatively high threshold on the reconstructed jets are the only handles to suppress this background 4:

Footnote 4: For the analysis presented here we adopt thresholds which are lower than the ones foreseen by the present LVL1 trigger menu.

The following selection is foreseen:

* At least four jets, reconstructed with \(p_{T}~{}>~{}30\) GeV and identified as b-jets.
* The best combination of two pairs of b-tagged jets to have a pair of invariant mass within mass window \(m_{bb}~{}=~{}m_{h}~{}\pm~{}2\sigma\) GeV, where \(\sigma=7.8~{}GeV\) for fast simulation and \(8.9~{}GeV\) for full one.
* The \(m_{bbbb}\) invariant mass within mass window \(m_{bbbb}~{}=~{}m_{H}~{}\pm~{}26\) GeV, after applying the h-boson mass constraint to both pairs of b-tagged jets.

On Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 one can see \(m_{bb}\) and \(m_{bbbb}\) distributions for full and fast simulations.

Conclusions

Several channels from the Higgs searches scenarios with multi-b-jet final state were studied with the fast and full simulations. They represent a rich sample of events with different energy/mass scales and complexity of topology.

In general good agreement between results from the full and fast simulation was found on the expected resolution for reconstruction of the resonant peaks and the overall acceptances. It was shown also that the proposed calibration algorithm for the detector and physics effects works well in the large range of the jets energy scale.

With the final estimates, agreement better then 3% on the reconstructed position of the resonance was achievable in the mass range 100-400 GeV. Up to 10% agreement was also found on the level of expected tails for each of the reconstructed resonances. In the most complicated case of \(t\bar{t}H\) reconstruction, final acceptance was lower by less then 10% only by the end of the selection with the full simulation of the detector with respect to the one achieved on the fast simulation level.
