## Abstract

This note describes a first-level calorimeter trigger processor designed to take advantage of new possibilities that arise as a consequence of modern design techniques and components such as optical interconnections, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and multi-chip modules (MCMs). The design is homogeneous down to the trigger cell level. This means that no boundary effects occur due to the system partitioning. The construction presented relies mainly on two different types of highly complex ASICs for processing and an MCM for opto-electrical conversion of input data.

The trigger processor performs electron/photon identification, jet detection and missing \(\rm E_{T}\) calculations for the central first-level trigger and region of interest (RoI) selection for the second-level trigger. Exploring the possibilities given by advanced technologies leads to a first-level trigger architecture with advantages over more traditional designs, allowing, for example, higher precision calculations. Remaining degrees of freedom can be used to enhance the ambition level of the trigger design

A demonstrator programme intended to verify the system performance has been funded and is under development with the aim to manufacture modules and start tests of these during 1995. Depending on the outcome of these tests, the trigger design presented in the ATLAS technical proposal may be modified to benefit from improved performance and/or reduced cost.
