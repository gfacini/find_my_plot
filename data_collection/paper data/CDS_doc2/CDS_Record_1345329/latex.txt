Introduction

Isolated photons with large transverse momentum in the final state are distinguishing signatures for many physics analyses envisaged at the LHC by the ATLAS experiment [1], such as the search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the low mass region, or the search for more exotic particles such as the graviton predicted in Ref. [2]. Since the publication of the _Expected Performance of the ATLAS Experiment_[1] several aspects of the reconstruction and identification of photons in ATLAS have been improved. This note documents the changes with respect to what is described in Ref. [3], and assesses on simulated data the expected performance of these new reconstruction and identification tools. The reconstruction and identification tools described in this note are the ones used to treat the first LHC data.

Since Ref. [3] the ATLAS photon reconstruction strategy has evolved. In particular, the reconstruction of photon converting in an electron-positron pair in the ATLAS Inner Detector has been completely revised, specifically addressing the issue of resolving the ambiguity between converted photons and electrons. The current photon trigger selection and its expected performance are discussed in Section 2. The photon reconstruction and the strategy to separate converted photons from electrons are detailed in Section 3; the performance of these algorithms is discussed in Section 3.2.

The cut-based photon identification, using discriminating variables related to the properties of the the energy deposit in the electromagnetic calorimeter, has undergone some optimization. The definition of some of the discriminating variables used in the selections has evolved (Section 4.1); a new _loose_ selection - harmonized with the corresponding electron one and used for triggering purposes - is introduced (Section 4.2), while the already existing _tight_ selection is separately optimized for unconverted and converted photons (Section 4.3). The algorithm to identify isolated photons is described in Section 5, together with the required target efficiency.

The signal efficiency of the new cut-based selections are evaluated for simulated benchmark prompt photons and \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) signal events, as well as for high-\(p_{T}\) photons from a graviton decay process \(G\to\gamma\gamma\) (Section 6.1); their background rejection power is tested on Monte Carlo simulation jet samples (Section 6.2). The efficiency of a selection combining the optimized tight cuts and the isolation requirements is discussed in Section 6.3.

## 2 Photon trigger

### Photon trigger selection

The ATLAS trigger system is subdivided in three levels: the hardware-based first level trigger (L1) and the software-based High Level Trigger (HLT), comprised of the Level-2 (L2) and the Event Filter (EF). The reconstruction in the HLT is seeded by the L1 result and exploits the full granularity of the ATLAS sub-detectors. Only data contained in the regions of the detector identified by the L1, each region corresponding to \(\sim\)2 % of the detector, are processed. At L2 fast reconstruction algorithms are deployed whereas at EF level simplified offline reconstruction algorithms are used.

At L1, photon selections are based on calorimeter information with a reduced granularity. Electromagnetic clusters are searched for and retained if the transverse energy passes the thresholds, which are specified by the trigger menu. In case the event is accepted by L1, L2 is seeded by the L1 cluster position. At this stage full granularity data is available and the calorimeter reconstruction works very similarly to the offline algorithm. The main difference with the offline reconstruction is the cluster seed finding step, which is done using the most energetic cell in the second EM layer at L2 compared to the use of the sliding window algorithm in the offline reconstruction. Cluster building, calibration and cluster corrections are the same as in the offline reconstruction. The EF re-uses the offline reconstruction algorithms, however, conversion reconstruction is not attempted. Non essential parts for the identification of e/\(\gamma\) candidates such as the four-momentum builder are not run. The photon trigger is set-up for the initial phase of the data taking to act as an an electron trigger which relies only on the calorimeter. Therefore clusters are reconstructed in the electro-magnetic calorimeter within \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.075\times 0.175\) instead of using cluster sizes optimized for photons as done in the offline reconstruction. Cluster corrections estimated for electrons are used rather than those for photons. After the initial physics run in 2010, the photon trigger will move away from the electron approximation and use its own photon specific calibrations and cluster corrections. More information on the trigger selections and menus can be found in Ref. [4].

A selection from the initial collections of photon candidates corresponding to energy clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter is then performed at the trigger level to discriminate isolated photons from jets with a large electromagnetic component. This identification is done by the EF in a very similar way as in the offline selection, using the same cuts as used in the offline calorimeter-based selections for electrons (see Ref. [5]). At L2 only a subset of the offline/EF selection criteria is used; these L2 cuts are set in order to be looser than the EF ones.

For the first physics run the primary or main triggers to be run are the g20 and em105_passHLT triggers. The motivation for the g20_loose trigger is the measurement of the direct photon production, jet calibration using \(\gamma\)-jet events, and signals from new physics containing high-\(p_{T}\) photons. For searches with very high-\(p_{T}\) photons a trigger which selects electron and photon candidates with \(E_{T}>100\) GeV at L1 and no additional selections in the HLT is in place (em105_passHLT).

### Expected photon trigger performance

For the first physics runs a luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}=10^{31}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) was assumed at a center of mass energy of 10 TeV. In the meantime the center of mass energy for initial running has been reduced to 7 TeV. Table 1 shows the expected trigger rates, as obtained from simulated data, for the primary g20 and em105_passHLT triggers for running at 10 TeV. For 7 TeV running the cross sections of the physics channels containing high-\(p_{T}\) photons and the relevant backgrounds are around 30% lower.

Figure 1 shows the trigger efficiencies for isolated photons as a function of \(E_{T}\) and pseudorapidity for the primary triggers foreseen for running at \(\mathcal{L}=10^{31}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). These efficiencies are computed using an event sample of 500k single photons with \(0.5<E_{T}<80\) GeV, and normalized to photons reconstructed offline and passing the _loose_ selections (see Section 4.2 for details).

As can be seen there are small trigger losses w.r.t. the offline selection. Losses occur at L1 in the complicated barrel/endcap region in which the energy reconstruction at L1 is degraded due the coarse granularity and the feature that the gap scintillators cannot be used at this stage to correct for energy losses in this region. Additional losses of \(\sim\)0.5% occur at the EF. As perhaps better seen in Tables 2 and 3 these losses are slightly bigger for conversions. These losses arise from the tight matching criteria of \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}=0.1\) between the offline and EF cluster position, and disappears if the matching criterion is relaxed.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c} \hline \hline Level & g20\_loose & em105\_passHLT \\ \hline L1 & 130 Hz & \(<1\) Hz \\ L2 & 55 Hz & \(<1\) Hz \\ EF & 10.5 Hz & \(<1\) Hz \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

The efficiencies are normalized to photons reconstructed offline and passing the _loose_ selections (see Section 4.2 for details). These plots were produced using an event sample of 500k single photons with \(0.5<E_{T}<80\) GeV. For the pseudorapidity plots single photons with an offline \(E_{T}>25\) GeV were chosen in order to show only the efficiency in the plateau region.

## 3 Photon reconstruction

### Reconstruction strategy

#### 3.1.1 Reconstruction of electrons and unconverted photons

The reconstruction of photons follows in its main aspects that of electrons [5]; both objects are treated similarly within an overall reconstruction algorithm. Although the definition of an electron object is rather straightforward, relying entirely on the presence of a track matching an electromagnetic cluster, that of a photon is a bit more involved, due to the fact that photons can be classified into two main categories: converted and unconverted photons. Photons reconstructed as converted are characterized by the presence of at least one track matching an electromagnetic cluster originating from a vertex inside the tracker volume, whereas unconverted photons do not have such a matched track. There is an underlying similarity between electrons and converted photons due to the presence of tracks in both objects; this results in a certain amount of ambiguity between the two.

#### 3.1.2 Reconstruction of converted photons

The reconstruction of converted photons includes the initial reconstruction of the conversion vertices inside the tracker are reconstructed, described in detail in Ref. [6], followed by the reconstruction and association of conversion vertices to an electromagnetic calorimeter cluster, that is discussed in the following.

The conversion vertices reconstructed by the inner detector (ID) are classified depending on the number of electron tracks assigned to them. Conversion vertices with two tracks are reconstructed by performing a constrained vertex fit using the track parameters of the two participating electrons under the condition that the photon is a massless particle. Conversion vertices with one electron track assigned to them are mostly located at larger radial positions inside the tracker. In the latter cases a vertex fit cannot be performed: the conversion vertex is then placed at the location of the first measurement of the participating track, and the original converted photon momentum vector cannot be determined. This is typically the case when one of the two produced electron tracks failed to be reconstructed either because it is very soft (asymmetric conversions where one of the two tracks has \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<0.5\) GeV), or when the two tracks are very close to each other (symmetric conversions that happen late inside the tracker producing two high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) tracks) and they cannot be adequately separated.

Both types of reconstructed conversion vertices are classified as conversion vertex candidates; they can either be a single- or a double-track conversion vertex candidates. These candidates are then transformed into converted photon objects, if they can be matched to a reconstructed electromagnetic calorimeter cluster. A track is considered as matched to an electromagnetic cluster if its impact point after extrapolation from its last measurement to the calorimeter second sampling is within a certain range

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \hline \hline  & & \(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{trigger}}\) (\%) & \\ Level & \(E_{T}>20\) GeV & \(E_{T}>25\) GeV & \(E_{T}>40\) GeV \\ \hline L1 & \(99.0\pm 0.4\) & \(99.6\pm 0.4\) & \(99.9\pm 0.5\) \\ L2 & \(98.6\pm 0.4\) & \(99.5\pm 0.4\) & \(99.8\pm 0.5\) \\ EF & \(98.0\pm 0.4\) & \(99.0\pm 0.4\) & \(99.4\pm 0.5\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

in (\(\eta\),\(\phi\)) from the cluster center.

Because of the above strategy, almost all converted photons will also end up inside the reconstructed electron collection. This fact is remedied by verifying whether any reconstructed conversion vertex candidate can be matched to a cluster. This matching procedure varies according to the characteristics of the conversion vertex candidate associated to the cluster:

* Single-track conversion vertex candidates associated to the cluster. The track is extrapolated to the second calorimeter sampling from its last measurement. If the impact point on the calorimeter is within a certain window in (\(\eta\),\(\phi\)) from the cluster center in that sampling, the conversion vertex candidate is considered as matched to that cluster.
* Double-track conversion vertex candidates associated to the cluster, where one of the two track momenta is much smaller (factor of 4) compared to the other. In this case the original converted photon direction is used reconstructed by the two electron track parameters at the vertex returned by the constrained vertex fit. A straight line extrapolation is then performed from the conversion vertex position to the second sampling of the electromagnetic calorimeter. If the impact point is within a certain window in (\(\eta\),\(\phi\)) from the cluster center in this sampling, the conversion vertex candidate is considered as matched to that cluster.
* Double-track conversion vertex candidates associated to the cluster, where the two track momenta are not very much different (less than a factor of 4) from each other. Each track is extrapolated individually to the calorimeter second sampling, as in the case of the single-track conversion vertex candidates. If both then are matched to the same cluster, the conversion vertex candidate is considered as matched to that cluster too.

In all the track-to-cluster matches above, the size of the window is taken to be 0.05 on each side of the impact point in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\). It is extended to 0.1 in \(\phi\) on the side where the bremsstrahlung losses are expected during the track extrapolation.

It is possible that more than one conversion vertex candidate can be matched to the same electromagnetic cluster. This is especially true in the case of electromagnetic showers, where more than one conversion vertex exists within a small (\(\eta\),\(\phi\)) region, all of them pointing towards the same cluster. In this case all matched conversion vertex candidates are retained and ordered according to the following criteria: double-track conversion candidates have precedence over single-track ones; among double-track conversion candidates, the one with the smallest radial position of the corresponding vertex has precedence over the rest; among single-track conversion candidates, the one with the smallest radial position of the corresponding vertex has precedence over the rest.

Any cluster that does not have any tracks (primary or originating from conversion candidate vertices) matched to it, is considered to be an unconverted photon candidate. A generic calibration and some basic corrections are applied in order to compute the cluster energy [7].

At this stage of the reconstruction most unconverted photon candidates have been identified; the converted ones, which reside almost entirely within the electron collection, still need to be considered. In addition, a significant fraction of unconverted photons (\(\sim 9\,\%\) in the \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) simulated sample) have also been reconstructed as electrons, due to tracks with normally \(p_{T}<2\) GeV that have been erroneously assigned to electromagnetic clusters. All these photons need to be properly recovered, and a dedicated procedure has been developed for this purpose. This is applied after the reconstruction of electrons has been completed.

#### 3.1.3 Cleaning cuts

Any noisy or sporadic noisy channel can sometimes produce a signal with transverse momentum larger than 2.5 GeV and give rise to a sliding window cluster, whose energy is mainly contained in a single cell, producing a fake electron or photon. While these channels are masked at the reconstruction level according to the database of noisy cells, new problematic channels may appear and pollute the data before they are identified and tagged for masking. In order to avoid this, additional cleaning cuts are also applied at the reconstruction level requiring that the fractions of the reconstructed energy in the presampler and in each layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter do not exceed a threshold respectively of 0.9, 0.9, 0.98 and 0.8.

#### 3.1.4 Recovery of converted photons

After the initial reconstruction stages described in Section 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, almost all converted photons are treated as electron candidates, albeit with a matching conversion vertex candidate assigned to them. This provides a strong indication of a converted photon candidate and is a starting point for the recovery of these photons. Additional single-track conversions can be recovered from electron candidates without a matching conversion vertex candidate as described below. The recovery of converted photon candidates, described here, is part of the recovery of both converted and unconverted photon candidates.

Figure 2 shows a schematic of how the converted photon recovery procedure works. For electron candidates with assigned conversion vertex candidates, the best matched track (normally the track whose impact point after the extrapolation to the second sampling of the electromagnetic calorimeter is the closest to the cluster center) is evaluated against the track(s) originating from the best conversion vertex candidate matched to the same cluster (see Figure 3). If the track coincides with a track coming from the conversion vertex (a single- or a double-track one), then this electron is treated as a converted photon. The only exception is the case of a double-track conversion vertex candidate where the coinciding track has a B-layer hit, while the other track lacks one. If the track does not coincide with any of the tracks

Figure 2: Photon recovery procedure flow chart. See Figure 3 for a description of the initial electron-converted photon separation.

assigned to the conversion vertex candidate, then it is kept as an electron, unless the track \(p_{T}\) is smaller than that of the candidate converted photon \(p_{T}\). Converted photons can also be recovered from electron candidates without an assigned conversion vertex candidate: if the originally reconstructed electron has a best matched track that is made of only Transition Radiation Tracker hits (TRT-only track) with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV and \(E/p<10\) (\(E\) being the cluster energy, \(p\) the track momentum) it is then considered a converted photon, regardless of whether a conversion vertex candidate has been matched to its electromagnetic cluster or not. In the second case a vertex is assigned to the first hit of the track resulting in a single-track converted photon candidate.

The cluster corresponding to an converted photon is rebuilt with a larger size with respect to the one used for unconverted photons, to accomodate the systematically larger shower in the \(\phi\) direction. A dedicated converted photon calibration and the necessary corrections for longitudinal and transverse energy losses are applied [7].

The reconstructed vertices can then be corrected for bremsstrahlung losses: each track assigned to the vertex is refitted under the electron hypothesis using dedicated track fitters that provide corrections for bremsstrahlung effects. Then the constrained vertex fit is performed once more resulting in a more precise reconstructed vertex position.

All the electrons matched with a track reconstructed in the Transition Radiation Detector only and with \(p_{T}<2\) GeV are automatically considered to be unconverted photon candidates. In addition electrons that failed to be considered as converted photon candidates, and for which their best matched track has \(p_{T}<2\) GeV or \(E/p>10\), will also be treated as unconverted photon candidates. Using this procedure 6 out of 7 unconverted photons erroneously categorized as electrons are recovered.

Figure 3: Description of the initial separation of electrons from converted photons as part of the photon recovery procedure outlined in Figure 2.

### Performance of photon reconstruction and recovery

Photons from \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) decays for \(m_{H}=120\) GeV with true transverse momentum \(p_{T}>20\) GeV are used to compute the reconstruction efficiencies before and after the recovery procedures described in Section 3.1. The acceptance is limited to \(|\eta|<2.37\), \(\eta\) being the true pseudorapidity position of the photon, and photons in the transition region between the barrel and end-cap cryostats (\(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\)) are removed. The overall reconstruction efficiency before recovery is \(56.61\pm 0.12\%\) (\(5.71\pm 0.09\%\) for converted photons and \(85.89\pm 0.10\%\) for unconverted photons).1 After recovery, it is \(97.82\pm 0.03\%\) (\(94.33\pm 0.09\%\) for converted photons and \(99.83\pm 0.01\%\) for unconverted photons). A small fraction of photons (\(2.11\pm 0.03\%\)) is not recovered from the initial collection of electron candidates, which means that only \(0.06\pm 0.01\%\) of photons are not reconstructed at all.

Footnote 1: The fraction of converted photons in a sample depends on the photon \(\eta\) position \(E_{T}\). In the medium-\(E_{T}\) range it can range from about 10% at \(\eta=0\) to about 50% at \(\eta=2\)[8].

These results are summarized in the Table 4. The overall reconstruction efficiencies before and after the recovery procedures are shown as a function of \(\eta\) (without acceptance cut) and \(p_{T}\) in Figure 4. The fraction of photons which are still in the initial collection of electron candidates after the recovery procedure is also shown. The reconstruction efficiencies as a function of \(\eta\) (without acceptance cut) and \(p_{T}\) for unconverted and converted photons separately are shown in Figure 5 (before recovery) and Figure 6 (after recovery).

## 4 Rectangular cut optimization for photon identification

### Discriminating variables

The baseline photon identification algorithms in ATLAS rely on rectangular cuts using calorimetric variables which deliver good separation between isolated photons and fake signatures from QCD jets. Two reference sets of cuts - loose and tight - have been defined, as listed in Table 5.

The calorimetric variables used in the photon selections, already described in details in Section 3.1.1 of Ref. [3], can be grouped in three main categories: hadronic leakage, variables using the second longitudinal compartment (middle layer) of the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC), and variables using the first longitudinal compartment (strip layer) of the EMC. A very brief description of these variables is found in Table 5. Figure 7 shows an example of the behaviour of the mean of each calorimetric discriminating variables as a function of the pseudorapidity \(|\eta|\), for both true and fake photons with \(E_{T}>20\) GeV

before any selection. Figure 8 shows an example of the normalized distributions of the calorimetric discriminating variables in the region \(0<|\eta|<0.6\) for \(E_{T}>20\) GeV for true and fake photons before any selection. All quantities for true photons plotted in Figures 7 and 8 are obtained from photon candidates reconstructed in a sample of \(\gamma\)-jet events and matched to true prompt photons; all figures for fake photons are obtained from photon candidates reconstructed in a sample of QCD \(jj\) events, and not matched to true photons originating from parton bremsstrahlung.

In Ref. [3]\(R_{\mathrm{had}_{1}}\) was used along the whole \(\eta\) acceptance range, however the use of the normalized total hadronic energy \(R_{\mathrm{had}}\) is found to be more effective in discriminating hadronic showers in the region \(0.8<|\eta|<1.37\) (see Figure 7). With respect to Ref. [3] the new variable \(E_{\mathrm{ratio}}\) has been introduced in the tight selection, replacing the rescaled second maximum in the EM Strip layer \(R_{\mathrm{max}\,1}\) used there, since \(E_{\mathrm{ratio}}\) was found to be more powerful in discriminating isolated leading \(\pi^{0}\)s.

In contrast to what was done in Ref. [3], in order to keep the photon selections as simple as possible no \(E_{T}\) dependence of the cut thresholds is introduced at any selection level. Both loose and tight cut values are optimized in \(|\eta|\) bins. Tight cuts are separately optimized for unconverted and converted photon candidates (see Section 4.3).

### Loose selection

For trigger purposes, electrons and photons share a common set of loose cuts and cut thresholds (see Section 2 and Ref. [5]). This basic selection includes shower-shape variables based on information from the EMC Middle layer (\(R_{\eta}\), \(w_{2}\)), together with hadronic leakage, the fraction of the cluster energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter layers beyond the EM calorimeter (see Table 5). This subset of discriminating variables shows relatively small differences for unconverted and and converted photons, so using only these variables in the loose selection keeps the two efficiencies for the two types of photon as similar as possible. Because of the sensitivity to the exact amount of material in front of the calorimeter and of the large cross-talk between neighboring cells in the EMC Strip layer, the discriminating variables obtained from this calorimeter section are not considered robust enough to be used for triggering purposes, especially at the beginning of the LHC data taking.

The values of the cuts are optimized for nine different \(|\eta|\) regions to respect the g20_loose trigger rate requirements (see Section 2), while still providing an excellent efficiency and a reasonable fake rate (see Section 6).

### Tight selection

The tight photon requirements are also optimized to provide good rejection of the most dangerous background consisting of isolated leading \(\pi^{0}\)s. They comprise tighter cuts on the variables used for the loose cut selection (Section 4.2), an additional cut on one middle layer quantity, and especially cuts on quantities computed from the energy deposit in the strip layer, which - with its fine granularity - provides good \(\gamma-\pi^{0}\) separation (see Table 5). As a consequence, photon candidates are required to lie in the pseudorapidity region covered by the finely segmented part of the first layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter: photon candidates in the regions \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\) and \(|\eta|>2.37\) are thus rejected by the tight identification criteria.

The tight cuts are separately optimized for unconverted and converted photon candidates, in order to take into account the fact that the electromagnetic deposits are different in the two cases (for instance, the electron and positron belonging to a photon conversion pair are bent in opposite directions in \(\phi\) from the solenoid magnetic field and thus the shower is wider). The optimization has been performed using TMVA [9], in the same \(|\eta|\) regions used for the definition of the loose photon identification criteria, with the exception of the regions \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\) and \(2.37<|\eta|<2.47\) which are simply rejected (for the reasons illustrated previously): 14 independent optimizations are performed in total, one for converted Figure 7: Distributions of the means of each calorimetric discriminating variables as a function of the pseudorapidity \(|\eta|\) for true and fake photons with \(E_{T}>20\) GeV before any selection. Both true and fake photons are separated in converted and unconverted candidates. Because of the systematically smaller average value of \(R_{\rm had_{1}}\) in the region \(0.8<|\eta|<1.37\) (top left plot), the normalized total hadronic energy \(R_{\rm had}\) is used instead in this zone to discriminate hadronic showers (see text for details).

photons and one for unconverted photons in each of the seven pseudorapidity regions covered by the strip layer. The cut thresholds are chosen in order to provide an identification efficiency around 85% with respect to the initial collection of reconstructed candidates for both unconverted and converted photons with \(E_{T}>20\), and to minimize the corresponding fake rate (see Section 6). The optimization is performed separately for photon candidates reconstructed either as converted or unconverted ones. The samples are split in two halves, one used for training and one for testing.

## 5 Photon isolation algorithm and cuts

The photon identification described so far does not include dedicated isolation cuts. Various analyses may require different isolation criteria of different tightness and therefore the isolation cuts are applied on top of the photon identification. Different calorimeter and tracking based isolation variables have been studied and optimized. They are used to define a set of reference cuts.

A calorimetric isolation discriminator \(E_{T}^{\mathrm{cone}}(R_{0})\) is computed from the reconstructed transverse energy in a cone of half opening angle \(R_{0}\) around the photon candidate direction, where the energy of the photon itself is excluded. While a larger cone will contain more energy in case of misidentified jets, a smaller cone is more robust against energy depositions from pile-up events. A cone with \(R_{0}=0.3\) has been found to give the best trade-off with high discrimination power and robustness against pile-up at the same time. Typical distributions of this \(E_{T}^{\mathrm{cone}}(0.3)\) discriminating variable, normalized to the candidate \(E_{T}\), are shown in Figure 10 (left) for photons from \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) decays (\(m_{H}=120\)) and background candidates in a sample of QCD \(jj\) events passing the tight selection cuts. No pile-up is considered in this study.

In addition a tracking based discriminator \(p_{T}^{\mathrm{cone}}(R_{0})\) is used, which is the summed scalar \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of tracks in a cone of \(R_{0}=0.3\) around the photon. In contrast to the calorimetric isolation, neutral particles do not contribute to this quantity. The advantage, however, is that track quality criteria can be applied in order to reject tracks from pile-up vertices. Tracks are considered if they have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>1\), which have a hit in the innermost pixel detector layer, at least 7 hits in silicon detectors and a transverse impact parameter less than 1. In contrast to electrons, no cut on the longitudinal impact parameter is applied. Tracks within \(\Delta R<0.1\) to the photon are also required to be not matched to a conversion vertex. Typical distributions of this \(p_{T}^{\mathrm{cone}}(0.3)\) discriminating variable, normalized to the candidate \(E_{T}\), are shown in Figure 10 (right) for photons from \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) decays (\(m_{H}=120\)) and background candidates in a sample of QCD \(jj\) events passing the _tight_ selection cuts.

When applying cuts on the isolation variables, the effects of correlations between isolation variables and \(E_{T}\) and \(\eta\) are minimized by separately optimizing the cuts for different regions in \(E_{T}\) and \(\eta\). Especially for higher \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges, this procedure is limited by the statistics of the simulated jet sample. Therefore, to further reduce correlation effects, the described isolation variables are divided by \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\).

The photons which are used for the cut optimization are required to pass the tight photon identification criteria. The optimization is done in such a way that the efficiency for isolated photons, with respect to the candidates passing the tight selection, is constant in all ranges of \(E_{T}\) and \(\eta\). Different sets of cuts that exploit calorimetric isolation (5 cuts), tracking isolation (3 cuts) and combined calorimetric and tracking isolation (4 cuts) were optimized. They respectively give 99 %, 98 %, 95 %, 90 % and 80 % efficiency (5 calorimetric isolation cuts), 99 %, 98 % and 95 % efficiency (3 tracking isolation cuts), 99 %, 98 %, 95 % and 90 % efficiency (4 combined isolation cuts) for isolated photons. Their rejection power is discussed in Section 6.3.

## 6 Selection efficiencies and rejections

The expected performance of the ATLAS detector in term of photon identification efficiency and QCD jet rejection is summarized here. The performance is studied over the full \(E_{T}\) and \(\eta\) range using benchmark processes (prompt photon production, photon from \(H\to\gamma\gamma\), QCD jet production in the medium-\(E_{T}\) range, and photons from Randall-Sundrum graviton decay \(G\to\gamma\gamma\)[2] in the high-\(E_{T}\) range.

To evaluate the identification efficiency and the fake rate, it is necessary to provide an association between reconstructed photon candidates and true particles. This is achieved in the following way:

* all "final state particles" are extrapolated to their impact point in the second sampling of the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMS2), taking into account the magnetic field for charged particles (here "final state particles" are defined as all non-decaying particles produced by the generator, excluding neutrinos; a cutoff \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>1\) GeV is applied); (\(\eta^{\mathrm{extr}},\phi^{\mathrm{extr}}\)) are the coordinates of the extrapolated point;
* for each photon candidate, the position (\(\eta^{\mathrm{clus}},\phi^{\mathrm{clus}}\)) of the cluster barycentre in the EMS2 layer is compared to the coordinates (\(\eta^{\mathrm{extr}},\phi^{\mathrm{extr}}\)) obtained for all the final state particles; depending on \(\Delta\eta=\eta^{\mathrm{extr}}-\eta^{\mathrm{clus}}\) and \(\Delta\phi=\phi^{\mathrm{extr}}-\phi^{\mathrm{clus}}\), the best association between a candidate and a true particle is defined as follows:
* inside an elliptical cone (\(\Delta\eta/0.025)^{2}+(\Delta\phi/0.05)^{2}<1\), corresponding roughly to a \(3\times 5\) cluster, the true photon with highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is associated to the candidate; if no photons are found, the true particle with highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is associated to the candidate; in this way about 87% of candidates are associated to a true particle in a typical filtered-jet data set;
* to account for possible tails in the extrapolation result and increase the efficiency of the association, in case the previous criterion fails, the true particle with the smallest \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\) inside a cone \(\Delta R<0.1\) is associated;

In a typical filtered-jet data set, 98.5% of the photon candidates are associated to a true particle; the remaining 1.5% unassociated candidates are understood as originated by particles produced in interactions with the detector material.

When the photon candidate is associated with a true photon, a further discrimination is possible looking at its parent tree: _direct photons_ are defined as any of the following possibilities:

Figure 10: Calorimetric and tracking isolation energy normalized to the transverse energy, \(E_{T}^{\mathrm{cone}}/E_{T}\) and \(p_{T}^{\mathrm{cone}}/E_{T}\), for a cone of \(R_{0}=0.3\). The photon candidates are required to have a transverse energy larger than 15 GeV and to pass the _tight_ photon identification cuts (without isolation).

* photons from hard scattering, i.e. produced by the interactions of two particles, of which at least one is a quark or a gluon
* photons from fragmentation, emitted by a quark or a gluon before the hadronization process
* photons coming from the decay of a fundamental boson (e.g. Higgs, graviton);

the remaining photons come from the decays of neutral hadrons

Background jets are separated in quark-initiated and gluon-initiated jets. The quark or gluon initiation is defined using the type of the highest \(E_{T}\) parton from the generator record inside a cone of \(\Delta R=0.4\) around the reconstructed object.

The photon identification efficiency is defined as:

\[\varepsilon=\frac{N_{\gamma}^{\rm reco,\,pass\,cut}}{N_{\gamma}^{\rm truth}}\,, \tag{1}\]

where \(N_{\gamma}^{\rm truth}\) is the total number of true photons having true \(E_{T}\) greater than a given threshold (20, 25 and 40 GeV), and \(N_{\gamma}^{\rm reco,\,pass\,cut}\) is the number of reconstructed photon candidates associated with a true photon and with true \(E_{T}\) greater than the same threshold that pass the selection criteria under study. The identification efficiency with respect to the reconstructed candidates is defined as:

\[\varepsilon_{\rm wft\,reco}=\frac{N_{\gamma}^{\rm reco,\,pass\,cut}}{N_{\gamma }^{\rm reco}}\,, \tag{2}\]

where \(N_{\gamma}^{\rm reco}\) is the total number of true photons associated to a reconstructed candidate, having true \(E_{T}\) greater than a given threshold (20, 25 and 40 GeV). Efficiency figures are separately quoted for converted and unconverted photons.

The jet rejection figures are computed from filtered jet samples, and normalized with respect to the number of true jets:

\[R=\frac{N_{\rm jet}}{N_{\gamma}^{\rm fake}}\frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}}\frac{1}{ \varepsilon_{\rm filter}}\,, \tag{3}\]

\(N_{\rm fake}\) is the number of fake photons in reconstructed _filtered_ sample, the candidate matching true direct photons being removed. \(N_{1}=9849209\) is the number of events in the filtered sample. \(N_{\rm jet}\) is the total number of jets reconstructed in the _normalization_ sample, generated as the filtered samples but without the filter requirements, by summing particle four-momenta from the generator hadron level within a cone size \(\Delta R=0.4\). The ratio \(\frac{N_{\rm jet}}{N_{2}}\) measures the fraction of jets per generated event - \(N_{2}=4958000\) being the size of normalization sample - and is listed in Table 6 for different \(E_{T}\) thresholds in the \(\eta\) acceptance region \(|\eta|<2.37\), the region \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\) being excluded, \(\eta\) being the true pseudorapidity position. \(\varepsilon_{\rm filter}=0.07086\pm 0.00012\) is the efficiency of the generator filter applied to the filtered sample.

Efficiencies and rejections of the loose and tight selections are computed for all photon candidates in the fiducial volume in \(0<|\eta|<1.37\) and \(1.52<|\eta|<2.37\), in order to avoid biases from the overlap region between the barrel and end-caps electromagnetic calorimeters, and allow a direct comparison of the efficiency of the two selection levels.

### Photon identification efficiencies

Table 7 summarizes the average photon identification efficiencies for loose and tight selections with respect to the reconstructed candidates, as defined in Equation (2), computed for true prompt photons in the sample of \(\gamma\)-jet events having true \(E_{T}\) greater than 20, 25 and 40 GeV.

loose selections and the tight selections separately optimized for unconverted and converted candidates.

The reconstruction and selection efficiencies are measured using fully simulated \(\gamma\)-jet, \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) (\(m_{H}=120\GeV\)) and filtered electromagnetic di-jets samples. While the performance of the cut-based identification method are optimized at low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), their efficiency is shown to remain high for very high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) photons from Randall-Sundrum graviton samples (\(m_{G}=300\GeV\) and \(m_{G}=500\GeV\)). A background rejection of about \(5\cdot 10^{3}\) with a photon efficiency of 85% for \(E_{\mathrm{T}}>25\GeV\) is achieved with the tight selection.

Different isolation cuts, based on calorimetric isolation, track isolation and combined calorimetric and track isolation, are developed corresponding to different signal efficiencies. Their additional rejection power when applied on top of the tight cut-based selection is discussed, showing that the combined isolation requirements generally gives higher rejection than the pure calorimetric or track isolation requirements aiming at the same efficiency. An additional rejection factor of about 1.5 is obtained by adding the combined isolation requirement, for a 95% selection of the candidates passing the tight selection.
