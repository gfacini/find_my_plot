## 1 Introduction

The good performance of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter in terms of acceptance, homogeneity and energy resolution requires many parameters characterising the RO electrodes to be within well defined tolerances. The large size of the electrodes, exceeding the standards of printed circuit industry, will make the achievement of these requirements a very challenging task.

To ensure good operation of the calorimeter in the years to come, it is clear that quality controls of all the electrodes are mandatory.

Quick acceptance test on flat electrodes are foreseen at the production plants. Afterwards the electrodes will undergo some modifications in different laboratories for bending, contact soldering etc. An extensive set of tests is therefore well suited as a last operation just before stacking the electrodes and the absorbers to form calorimeter modules.

The purpose of this note is to describe the setup under development in Milano to test the electric properties of the RO electrodes at both low and high voltage. Some aspects related to the measurements done on bent RD3 (in the so called UV-GEM configuration) and flat ATLAS prototypes (\(0<\eta<0.8\)) will also be discussed.

To introduce the notation used throughout this note, a brief description of the electrodes follows.

In the calorimeter, the readout (RO) electrodes are centered between two absorbers leaving a 2 mm gap which is filled by liquid Argon.

The electrodes are flexible three-layer Copper-polyimide printed circuit boards: the inner copper layer (_signal layer_) with the two external copper layers (_high voltage layers_) form the blocking capacitances (\(C_{\mathrm{b}}\)) for the two liquid Argon gaps.

The signal layer is segmented in pads: it is radially subdivided into three sections (_samplings_) of different segmentation along \(\eta\). Due to the finer segmentation of the first sampling, its pads are called _strips_.

To increase preamplifier protection against high voltage (H.V.) sparks, the second and third samplings of the H.V. layers are further segmented into pads, connected through silk-screened resistors.

H.V. is fed from the back 1 of the electrode and is distributed to the pads through silk-screened resistors. In RD3 electrodes only, the H.V. distribution line is connected to the pads through discrete resistors.

Footnote 1: The convention used in this note is that front and back correspond to smaller and larger radii, respectively

Figure 1 shows a so called _exploded view_ of an ATLAS prototype of the barrel electrode, with the three copper layers drawn before glueing and bending to the accordion shape.

## 2 Low voltage tests

### Setup description

The experimental setup for low voltage tests consists of a test bench, housing the electrode and the electrical connections, a multiplexer switching system and the meters. A lateral view of the test bench, designed and built in the Milano laboratory, is shown in figure 2 and a cross-section is shown in 3.

The electric connection to the H.V. layers is obtained through golden spring probes with hemispherical head, acting on the electrodes with a force of about 1 N; these probes are supported by two accordion shaped PVC plates, which form the base and the top cover of the bench. This kind of probes have been extensively used to test RD3 prototypes: they showed good contact reliability without damaging the electrodes.

The electric connection to the signal layer is given by mating connectors at the front and at the back of the electrode.

All the leads from the probes and from the connectors are routed to a multiplexer switching system, based on 12 high density scanning cards and one matrix switch [1], computer controlled via a IEE488 Bus. All the switches are _Reed Relay_ type with low resistance and low stray capacitance. The scanning cards act as first level multiplexers while the the matrix is used as a second level. The latter is also used as a selector for the measurement type (R or \(C_{b}\)). A schematic view of the system is shown in figure 4.

The test setup was designed for three different measurements:

* \(C_{b}\) for both electrode sides
* cross capacitance (\(C_{X}\)) between two adjacent (along \(\eta\)) cells in the signal layer
* R between one pad and the common high voltage distribution pad at the back of the electrode

The number of probe contacts on the H.V. layers was a compromise between speed of operation, reliability of the control operation and cost.

At least one probe per sampling and \(\eta\) segment was guaranteed.

For the second sampling, though radially subdivided into few H.V. pads, only one probe was used and was put on the H.V. pad closer to the front part of the electrode; in this way, since the readout of the second layer is performed from the back, possible interruptions located anywhere along the signal pad can be detected by the \(C_{b}\) measurement.

In the third sampling, instead, each H.V. pad was provided with a probe; this choice is necessary to make sure that the R test will actually verify that all the H.V. pad of the third sampling can be correctly fed by the H.V.

A prototype of the test bench was built, with a structure such that four RD3 electrodes at the same time, bent to the accordion shape, could be measured.

### Capacitance measurement

#### 2.2.1 Requirements

The purpose of the \(C_{b}\) measurement is to detect severe pathologies of the RO electrode such as interruptions in the signal layer (interruptions in the H.V. layer can be more easily detected by the R measurement), interruptions in the connection area, large local misalignements between signal and H.V. layers, shorts between adjacent cells in the signal layer and large non uniformities in the dielectric thickness and permittivity. For some of these defects, the \(C_{b}\) measurement is complementary to the visual inspection of the electrode.

This test consists therefore of searching substantial deviations of the measured \(C_{b}\) values for each electrode from a reference values. Indeed it is worth noticing that, as far as signal collection is concerned, a moderate \(C_{b}\) non uniformity in the electrode construction is tolerable, due to the large ratio (around 40) of blocking capacitance to detector capacitance (\(C_{D}\)).

thickness or permittivity in the second sampling which will not be detected by the high frequency measurement.

Effect of atmospheric conditionsIn order to study the sensitivity of the \(C_{b}\) measurement to changes in the atmospheric conditions, room temperature and relative humidity in the laboratory were extensively varied; the monitoring was done using probes [3] read from the computer via a voltmeter [4] and a IEE488 bus.

The \(C_{b}\) value of one pad of an ATLAS prototype electrode was measured. To decouple from effects of resistivity change of silk screened resistors the maximum possible frequency, i.e. 500 \(kHz\), was chosen. \(C_{b}\) was found to depend mostly on temperature with a sensitivity of \(\frac{\Delta C}{C}\thicksim 0.2\%/^{\circ}C\). This small dependence suggests that, for the \(C_{b}\) measurement, a room with controlled atmosphere is not necessary.

### Resistance measurement

#### 2.3.1 Requirements

The nominal resistivity of the ink used for the silk screened resistors of the ATLAS electrodes is 1 \(M\Omega/\Box\)[5].

Some spread around this value could be expected from the intrinsic non uniformity of the ink, from the procedure of application through sergiraphy and from the shape and the quality of the surfaces on which the ink is applied.

Good performances of the calorimeter in terms both of preamplifier protection and of energy resolution require the values of these resistors to lie inside a certain range.

Lower limits are set from preamplifier protection requirements, resistor noise and crosstalk considerations (for a calculation relative to another liquid Argon calorimeter see [6]).

Upper limits come from the need of minimising the high voltage drop across the liquid Argon gap, due to the DC current induced by minimum bias events: this drop will mainly affect the drift properties in the liquid Argon eventually reducing the signal amplitude at the preamplifier input.

These considerations limit the acceptable range of resistor values within some 100 \(K\Omega\) and few \(M\Omega\), being more critical in the end-cap region where one expects a higher DC current induced by minimum bias events.

#### 2.3.2 Measurements

Choice of the meterFor the silk screened resistor measurement the performances of two instruments were compared: the RLC precision bridge [2] used for the \(C_{b}\) measurement, and a digital multimeter [4]. For the former, the quantity to measure is \(Re(Z)\), being \(Z\) the complex impedance of the load. To measure the resistance, the lowest possible frequency of the test signal, i.e. 20 \(Hz\), was chosen.

Probes similar to those present in the test bench were used.

For this comparison, a selected set of 48 resistors connecting the first and the second sampling of an ATLAS prototype electrode were used. The mean value of the resistance, measured with the bridge, was around 400 \(k\Omega\) with a spread of about 200 \(k\Omega\) among different resistors; similar values were obtained with the multimeter.

Figure 7 shows the distributions of \(\sigma(R)/\bar{R}\) with the bridge (a)) and with the multimeter (b)), where \(\bar{R}\) is the mean value of 10 measurements and \(\sigma(R)\) the standard deviation. The measurements with the multimeter show less tails towards large values of \(\sigma(R)/\bar{R}\). Entries with large \(\sigma(R)/\bar{R}\) correspond to resistors where one or two measurements are significantly different from the others and could be due to electromagnetic interference.

Studies of resistor failuresUsing the digital multimeter, the R values of silk screened resistors of the five ATLAS prototype electrodes we received in Milano were systematically measured.

While most of resistors were found to have resistivity close to the nominal value, some of them (between 5 and 10 %) were found to have very large resistance values, extending even beyond the instrument range (100 \(M\Omega\)).

An explanation for this problem, which is supported by a few experimental observations, is that the silk screened resistors connecting two adjacent copper pads do not lie on flat surfaces, but sit across a valley (i.e. where the copper is absent) about 35 \(\mu m\) deep. Near the two edges of this valley, stresses induced on the electrode by manipulation or thermal contraction can create microscopic cracks in the ink film.

An observation which supports this hypotesis is that resistors with very high resistance values could be cured by manually depositing over the step region a narrow strip of silver paint [7]: after about an hour, the time needed for this paint to dry up, all the cured resistor had resistance values close to nominal.

A microscope inspection of some electrode metallographic sections 3 also showed that, for resistors having high resistance values, the resistive ink layer across the step regions becomes very thin. An indication was obtained, though on a limited sample and by manual deposition of the ink, that increasing the ink layer thickness can solve this problem.

Another observation in favour of the interpretation of cracks in the ink film comes from the following measurement. One piece of an ATLAS prototype electrode containing 6 resistors was cut away from the electrode and bent to circular shapes at four different radii of curvature: infinite, \(50,20\) and \(10\)\(cm\). The resistances on both sides were measured, with both positive and negative curvatures. The piece of electrode was chosen such that on one side it had, in the flat position, resistor with quite high resistance values, while on the other side all the resistance value were close to nominal. Figure 8 shows the measured R values for a) positive and b) negative radius of curvature. Only the first resistor, which was cured using the silver paint mentioned above, maintained the same R value after bending. In all other cases the trend is an increase of R with positive bending radius, reaching values outside the meter range, and a decrease of R with a negative bending radius, down to the nominal value.

On the other side of the electrode, the variation of R with bending radius is much smaller being 20 % on average, going from \(R=\infty\) to \(R=50\)\(cm\).

Effect of atmospheric conditionsThe sensitivity of the resistance values to room temperature and relative humidity was also measured. It was found \(\frac{\Delta R}{R}\thicksim-0.5\%/^{\circ}C\)and \(\frac{\Delta R}{R}\sim 0.05\%/\%\)_R.H._. These mild dependences indicate that also for the resistance measurement a room with controlled atmosphere is not necessary.

## 3 High Voltage tests

### Requirements

The H.V. test is a very important quality control of the RO electrodes. Indeed, a failure in the H.V. insulation provided by the dielectric will degrade a fraction of the sensitive volume of the calorimeter, even if the H.V. distribution scheme is designed to reduce the influence of such a failure. For this purpose the two H.V. layers of the electrode are fed by two independent power supplies; in case of failure of one dielectric layer, only one of the two LAr gaps will become inactive. Moreover, along \(\eta\), the electrode H.V. distribution system is segmented into sections, which are fed by independent power supplies. However, due to the small clearance along \(\eta\) between the pads of the H.V. layer (0.5 mm), it is possible that a discharge in one of the H.V. sections could propagate to the adjacent one.

Even in the absence of a discharge, an important quality parameter to be measured is the leakage current flowing in \(C_{b}\).

### Experimental setup

The experimental setup for the high voltage tests consists of a room with dry atmosphere and a high voltage supply system, computer controlled through a VME board. From previous experience it is known that a relative humidity of less than 40% is enough to prevent surface discharges in the good electrodes at 2 KV. The dry atmosphere also minimises the leakage current in the dielectric, which is highly hygroscopic.

The electrodes to be measured are stored in the room a few hours before the test. The H.V. is applied in parallel to the electrodes using a multi channel H.V. supply with current trip and current monitor on each channel [8].

The H.V. ramp-up is very slow, about 10 \(V/sec\) and is given in two steps of 1 \(KV\). After some time allowed for the conditioning of the dielectric, a current trip threshold is set and the current supplied by each H.V. channel is recorded.

To check for small discharges that will not fire the trip circuit of the H.V. supply, the current is sampled at a frequency of about 1 Hz.

### Measurements

Among the five ATLAS prototype electrodes, only three of them were found to have good H.V. behaviour. Figure 9a) shows for one of them the measured leakage current vs. time; the asymptotic value of the current is about 200 \(nA\)4. The other two electrodes, instead, could not stand the H.V. An example is shown in figure 9b), where a few spikes in the leakage current are clearly visible before the trip circuit kills definitively the H.V.

Footnote 4: It is clear that in the liquid Argon one can in principle find lower values of the leakage current, in case surface conduction dominates over bulk conduction In one case the problem was traced to a failure of the dielectric insulation of one pad and in the other case to a bad insulation in the fan-out region.

## 4 Time needed for the tests

From the experience acquired with prototype electrodes it is possible to give a rough estimate of the time needed to perform the different electric measurements on the final ATLAS electrodes.

The time needed for measuring \(C_{b}\) and \(R\) for one electrode is about 20 min, not including the time needed to put the electrode in the test bench and to plug in the connectors.

A meaningful H.V. test, which could also be performed with several electrodes at the same time, will take about 3-4 hours.
