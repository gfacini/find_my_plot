We describe a conceptual design of jet-cell muon chambers located before and after the warm Fe-toroid, with emphasis on the first level high \(p_{t}\) muon trigger and the readout scheme for measuring the second coordinate \(\phi\).

Motivation

Reliable trigger and momentum measurement of high \(p_{t}\) muons is one of the most important goals of the EAGLE detector. The muon system plays an important role in searching for Higgs bosons decaying into four leptons through \(Z\)'s at the nominal high luminosity of \(\approx 10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The muon detection is also important for tagging and studying top quark decays at the start up of the LHC machine with relatively low luminosity. Furthermore isolated leptons from gauge bosons are one of the keys to look for new physics beyond the Standard Model. For example, there would be many gauge bosons (\(Z\) and \(W\)) in the final state of cascade decay of supersymmetric particles (\(\tilde{g}\) or \(\tilde{l}\)). Very high momentum isolated leptons are expected from new gauge bosons \(Z^{\prime}\) or \(W^{\prime}\). Therefore the first level muon trigger is crucial to triggering interesting physics events. The second level trigger which is generated by combining information from several detector components is also needed to reduce the event rate.

For high momentum muons (\(p>100\) GeV/\(c\)), catastrophic energy loss of the muons in the material of the toroid or the calorimeter in front of the muon chambers presents a serious problem of reconstructing high momentum muon in the debris of electromagnetic shower. Therefore the muon chamber is required to have a good double track resolution against the hits caused by soft electrons near the original high momentum muons.

To have a uniform trigger efficiency and momentum resolution over a wide range of \(\eta\), it is better to have a projective geometry.

We propose to use jet-cell chambers for the EAGLE muon system. Advantages of Jet-cell type chambers are:

* it is a well established technology and good spatial resolution can be obtained,
* good double track separation of a few mm can be achieved,
* it is easy to form a projective geometry,
* generation of stand alone first level \(p_{t}\) trigger is possible,.
* "\(T_{0}\)" can be obtained locally by half-cell staggering.

## 2 Chamber Geometry

In the idea proposed by a CERN group[1], supermodules of \(\sim 4\) m \(\times\) 3 m \(\times\) 1 m are located in the muon stations. A supermodule consists of superlayers of muon chambers attached at the top and the bottom of the support structures (Fig.1).

In our proposed design the geometry of the chambers is tentatively defined as follows. A superlayer is subdivided into jet-cells by cathode wire planes. A jet-cell consists of six anode wires with \(\approx 1\) cm intervals (see Fig.2). The drift length of the chamber is not yet optimized but it would be between 1.5 cm to 3 cm. Assuming the drift velocity of 50 \(\mu\)m/ns, the drift length should be well below 5 cm in view of keeping the first level pipeline depth at a reasonable value (\(\sim 1\)\(\mu s\)). A long drift length is preferred in order to reduce the number of wires and the fraction of tracks crossing anode wire planes, but a short one is preferred to reduce diffusion effect.

The anode wire planes are directed to the nominal interaction point of the beams in the \(r-z\) plane, in order to form a projective geometry. Tracks are almost parallel to the anode wire planes guaranteeing a good double track separation.

In our design the high \(p_{t}\) muon trigger signals are generated using the last two superlayers in the outer muon station which are staggered by a half-cell unit.

## 3 First Level High \(p_{t}\) Trigger

The signal from each anode wire is amplified and fed to a discriminator. The timing information of the discriminator signal is recorded by a TMC (Time Memory Cell)[2] which is used for first level buffering. The discriminator output is used also for generating the first level trigger as described below.

The angle in the \(r-z\) plane made by a finite momentum muon track and the nearest anode wire plane is approximately inversely proportional to the \(p_{t}\) of the track. For a muon track with \(p_{t}=10\) GeV/\(c\) in the barrel region, difference between the drift length from the track to the first wire and that to the sixth wire in the same jet-cell is approximately 3.4 mm (see the Appendix). With the expected spatial resolution (\(100\sim 150\)\(\mu\)m per anode wire) we can easily distinguish high \(p_{t}\) tracks at the front-end electronics using only the 6 wires in a superlayer.

A virtual track with an infinite momentum coming from the nominal interaction point runs parallel to the nearest anode wire plane. The signals from the six anode wires in a superlayer are therefore simultaneous. In this case the timings of the signals from the two superlayers (\(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\)) staggered by a half-cell width satisfy the following relation:

\[(T_{1}+T_{2})/2=T_{0}+T_{\text{max. drift}}/2.\]

Therefore, by using a mean-timer method we can obtain the \(T_{0}\) information.

For finite momentum tracks, time difference caused by the inclination of the track has to be taken into account. A method to achieve this is schematically shown in Fig.3. The signals from each anode wire is sent to a shift register chain. The length of the chain corresponds to the maximum drift time. The signals from the upper superlayer and the lower superlayer run in the opposite direction. A hit pattern is searched for which is consistent with a straight track with a certain momentum range. The gradient of the pattern gives a rough estimation of the \(p_{t}\). The pattern will be found at the location (marked by the \(\otimes\) in the figure) which reflects the track position in the jet-cell. The time when the matching is found is equal to \(T_{0}+T_{\text{max.drift}}\).

The above naive scheme, however, requires that the pattern matching has to be carried out at every column of the shift register chains. A more practical solution is shown in the fig.4. Here the functions to find \(p_{t}\) and \(T_{0}\) are separated. A set of shift registers ("\(p_{t}\)_finder_") is prepared for each superlayer where the hits in the registers are compared with several predefined patterns. When a matching is found, a signal is sent to another shift register which is prepared for each finder. The length of the pair of the shift registers ("\(T_{0}\)_finder_") corresponds to the maximum drift time. The signals from the upper and lower \(p_{t}\) finders run in the opposite directions in the shift registers. A coincidence of the corresponding columns of the two register chains will be obtained at \(t=T_{0}+T_{\rm max.drift}\).

Because of the spread of the interaction point along the beam axis (r.m.s spread is 5.3 cm), even a track with infinite momentum has a finite angle with respect to the anode wire plane. The angle corresponds to \(\sim 100\) GeV/\(c\). Therefore it makes no sense to prepare \(p_{t}\) thresholds above \(\sim 100\) GeV/\(c\). This also limits the time bin of the shift register chains to be longer than or similar to 6 ns. The spatial resolution of the chamber also sets a limit of the same order. In the following discussions we choose the time bin of 6 ns.

A possible set of \(p_{t}\) patterns is shown in Fig.5(a). The width of the pattern allows a hit to be included in either of the two or three positions. A matching is said to be found when a certain majority out of the 6 layers found a hit in their respective pattern width. The trigger efficiency as a function of \(p_{t}\) has been obtained by a Monte Carlo simulation which includes effects of spatial resolution of each hit and various track positions within a cell. It is shown in Fig.5(b). Here the majority of \(\geq 5\) was required for the pattern matching. Fig.5(c) shows the distributions of \(T_{0}\) obtained by the \(T_{0}\) finder for three \(p_{t}\) values.

Problems arise when a relatively low-momentum track crosses an anode or cathode wire plane or it enters the same side of the anode wire planes in both superlayers as shown in the Fig.6. This leads to a loss in efficiency or a wrong \(T_{0}\) value. These effects are not taken into account in the Fig.5(b) and 5(c). The probability can be minimized by reducing the distance of the two superlayers and/or increasing the maximum drift length of a cell.

In the forward region, the deflection of a track is reduced by a factor of \(\tan\theta\) ( \(\sim 0.1\) at \(\eta=3\)) compared with the barrel region (see the Appendix). We could use the same trigger scheme as the barrel region but with only one or a few matching patterns in effect.

## 4 Readout of the Second Coordinate

There are several possible ways for obtaining the \(\phi\) coordinate of the muon tracks. One obvious way is to install chambers which are independent of the jet-cell chambers and dedicated to measuring the second coordinate. If the extra cost and effort is to be avoided for constructing the additional chambers, one can use the signals from the two ends of the anode wires of the jet-cell chambers. In this case the second coordinate is obtained either by a charge-division method or by taking the time difference between the two.

Probably the simplest way is to equip each end of an anode wire with a TMC and calculate the second coordinate by taking the difference of the two time measurements. Since the time bin of the TMC is 1 ns and the signal propagation speed of the anode wire is \(\sim 5\) ns/m, we can obtain an order of \(\sim\)20 cm resolution per anode wire. When measured at radius \(r\sim\)9 m, this corresponds to an azimuthal angle resolution of 20 mrad, which will be enough for the mass resolution of heavy Higgs boson decaying into four leptons. The calculation of the second coordinate is done with a micro-processor after the TMCs at the both ends are read out. We can improve the accuracy of the second coordinate by applying the method to several anode wires in a superlayer. However, we do not have to equip all the wires with the double-end readout.

## 5 Summary

We are proposing a jet-cell type chamber for the muon system. The first level high \(p_{t}\) trigger and \(T_{0}\) can be obtained with a certain accuracy in the outer muon station by staggering the last two superlayers by half cell unit. We do not necessarily require a separate triggering system like the one using RPC[3] or scintillator[4]. Muon chamber systems with a projective geometry are also considered for SDC[5][6] but their trigger system need the timing information from scintillator.

TMC can be used as the TDC and as the pipeline of the first level buffer. It can also be used to measure the second coordinate \(\phi\) from the time difference of the signals from both sides of the anode wire because of the fine time binning of TMC (1 ns).

## Appendix: Angle of a muon after the toroid

The deviation of the muon track angle caused by the bending in the magnetic field of the toroid in the barrel region is calculated to be

\[\delta = \sin^{-1}\frac{D/\sin\theta}{2\rho}\] \[\approx \frac{0.3B\ (\mathrm{Tesla})\cdot D\ (m)}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{p_{t}\ ( \mathrm{GeV}/c)}\]

where \(D\) is the thickness of the iron toroid measured at the \(\theta=90^{\circ}\), \(B\) is the magnetic field in the toroid, and \(\rho(m)=p(\mathrm{GeV}/c)/(0.3B(\mathrm{Tesla}))\) with \(p=p_{t}/|\sin\theta|\).

The maximum difference of the drift length within a jet-cell is

\[\ell\cdot\delta\ (\mathrm{mm})\approx 33.75\ \frac{1}{p_{t}\ (\mathrm{GeV}/c)}\]

where \(\ell\ (=5\ \mathrm{cm})\) is the distance between the first and the last anode wires in a jet-cell, \(D\) and \(B\) are assumed to be \(2.5\ \mathrm{m}\) and \(1.8\ \mathrm{Tesla}\).

In the forward region,

\[\delta(\mathrm{rad})\approx\ \frac{0.3B\ (\mathrm{Tesla})\cdot D\ (m)}{2}\cdot \frac{\tan\theta}{p_{t}\ (\mathrm{GeV}/c)}\]
