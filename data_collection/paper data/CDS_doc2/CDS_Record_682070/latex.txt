X-ray tomography is considered as a possible way for check of wire position inside drift tube of ATLAS muon spectrometer MDT chambers /1.4/.

In previous work /5/ we demonstrated a capability of X-ray tomography to measure a position of thin wires through aluminium layer. Relative coordinates of 25 \(\mu\)m diameter tungsten wires and 45 \(\mu\)m diameter stainless steel wires have been measured through 1 mm aluminium layer with precision about 10 - 20 \(\mu\)m. The similar technic was used for test with drift tubes. Below is a brief description of results.

## 2 Setup

The setup is shown schematically in fig. 1. Pulsed X-ray source placed in metallic box can be moved across drift tubes. Narrow X-ray beam is limited by 50 \(\mu\)m slit between two polished steel plates, length of which along beam is 70 mm.

Four drift tubes of 0.5 m long, 0.5 mm wall thickness, made of aluminium alloy are placed above the collimator. The tube centers lie at the same line, which direction does not coincident with the beam one. Distance from the first tube center to the collimator top is about of 50 mm.

Sense wire made of 50 \(\mu\)m diameter gold plated tungsten is fixed by creamping at two end-caps without careful positioning and its displacement from a tube center can be about several hundreds of microns. The tubes are filled with Ar+10%CO\({}_{2}\) at atmospheric pressure.

The length of collimator along the wire is 25 mm and an angle of the beam with respect to the wire was minimized by minimization of counting rate deep width measured for the first tube sense wire.

## 3 Results

We measured normalized counting rate ( n\({}_{w}\)/N\({}_{X}\) ) of all tubes as a function of relative X-ray beam position, where n\({}_{w}\) is a number of a sense wire signals in coincidence with N\({}_{X}\) pulses of the X-ray source. The sense wire voltage of 1.85 kV was chosen at the beginning of efficiency plateau. The X-ray pulse duration was 8 \(\mu\)s. An example of such dependence is shown in fig. 2 for the 1st and the 2nd tubes at 23 kV X-ray tube anode voltage.

The counting rate of a drift tube is proportional to the X-ray beam path inside the tube. Deep of counting rate due to the beam hitting of the 1st tube sense wire is clearly seen. Its position can be measured in the same tube ( "active" mode ) and in the next tubes ( "passive" mode ).

In fig. 3 it is shown the counting rate dependence for four tubes when the beam was moved in region of the 1st tube sense wire. Curve is a p\({}_{0}\) gaussian fit. Gaussian mean value, which fit error is 1-15 \(\mu\)m, can be taken as the beam coordinate opposite the wire. Relative value of the counting rate deep ( relation of gaussian amplitude to p\({}_{0}\) in the fit ) can be considered as signal-to-background ( S, R ) ratio.

In fig. 4 and 5 it is presented the counting rate when the beam was near the 2nd tube sense wire and the 3d tube sense wire accordingly. There was an instability of X-ray tube conditions during the measurements which appears as a slow change of the counting rate. To eliminate this drift we corrected the counting rate of tubes 2,3 and 4 ( fig. 4 ) using the 1st one as a reference. Data presented in fig. 5 for tube 3 and 4 were also corrected with tube 2 as a reference.

The 2nd and 3d tubes itself can not be used to measure position of its own wire. The wire of previous tube can be measured by next tubes.

There is a following explanation of absence of the counting rate deep when the beam hits the sense wire of a tube higher than the 1st one. When the beam hits the wire its counting rate will decrease due to wire shadow. But at the same time wire becomes a source of secondary photons due to fluorescence after absorption of beam and beam scattering. Detection of these photons by the tube will give increasing of the counting rate. So, we have two opposite sign contributions into the counting rate of a tube. Positive one will increase with increasing of beam energy, as it is proved by the dependence of signal-to-background ratio for the 1st tube wire versus anode voltage of the X-ray tube ( fig. 6 ). For full beam screening by the wire the S/B ratio must be about 30\(\pm\)5 % when the beam attenuation by tube gas filling is taken into account. With increasing of tube number the mean energy of beam will rise up and positive contribution will also increase, it gives cancelation of shadow effect of wire. We can not detect any signal when the beam hits the 2nd tube sense wire ( fig. 4 ), the 3d tube wire ( fig. 5 ) and the 4th tube wire. With father increasing of beam energy the positive contribution will dominant as it was seen in work/2/.

There is clear example of secondary photons detection by the 1st tube when the beam go through its wall ( fig.7 ). The picture shows the counting rate dependences when the beam is in region of the 1st tube right side wall. Fast increasing of the 2nd tube counting rate indicates the outer surface of the 1st tube wall. Residual counting rate is seen at the level of about 1-2 %, when the beam go through the tube wall. Such behaviour can be explained by the secondary photon detection only and we can consider the similar one for the beam hitting the sense wire. The emission of electrons from inner tube surface is excluded.

It is interesting to point out that coordinate of a tube wall ( fig. 2 and fig. 7 ) and wire displacement can be measured also.

In fig. 2 there are several thrown away points like ones at X = -7 mm, X = -5.5 mm. These outstanding from smooth behaviour points are repeated at the same coordinate during different scans and we explained them by the tube wall thickness variation. 5 \(\mu\)m change of wall thickness will give 1 % change of the counting rate.

## 4 Conclusion

Our X-ray source can be used for measurements of wires position the the first 3 layers of 4-layers MDT chamber. It will necessary to rotate chamber or replace X-source from one to another side of chamber to measure all layers. Precision of 10 \(\mu\)m can be reached.

Tube wall thickness unhomogenity and wire displacement can be measured with such technic also.

During wire position measurement with help of the X-ray beam full test of tube, including gas quality, connectors, HV power supply circuit and readout electronics will be fulfilled at the same time. Readout electronics can be tested up to TDC due to pulsed X-ray beam.
