The ATLAS Collaboration

## 1 Introduction

The production of energetic jets of particles in proton-proton (\(pp\)) collisions is one of the most numerous fundamental processes observed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This process represents both a distinctive signature of short-distance (_hard_) interactions between partons - and thus a central prediction of perturbative QCD - as well as a significant background to many searches for new physics. This document reports on the observation and first studies of the inputs to jet reconstruction and the properties of jets observed in the first stable beams collisions of the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV in early 2015.

Jets considered here are reconstructed using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with a radius parameter of \(R=0.4\). The input constituents to the jet algorithm are clusters of topologically connected calorimeter cells (topo-clusters) [1]. Properties of topo-clusters and charged tracks associated with the jets are measured, as well as the longitudinal and transverse jet structure and the modeling of close-by jets. Specific attention is given to the properties which serve as the input to the ATLAS jet calibration scheme and other observables related to the calibration. The measurements of quantities are compared to predictions from a full-detector Monte Carlo simulation of inclusive jet production. Only statistical uncertainties are considered in these results. Similar studies of jets based on early stable beam data have been published using \(\sqrt{s}=900\) GeV [2, 3] and \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [4] data.

## 2 The ATLAS detector

The ATLAS detector [5, 6] provides nearly full solid angle coverage around the collision point with an inner tracking system covering the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<2.5\)1, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters covering \(|\eta|<4.9\), and a muon spectrometer covering \(|\eta|<2.7\).

Footnote 1: The ATLAS reference system is a Cartesian right-handed coordinate system, with the nominal collision point at the origin. The anticlockwise beam direction defines the positive \(z\)-axis, while the positive \(x\)-axis is defined as pointing from the collision point to the centre of the LHC ring and the positive \(y\)-axis points upwards. The azimuthal angle \(\phi\) is measured around the beam axis, and the polar angle \(\theta\) is measured with respect to the \(z\)-axis. Pseudorapidity is defined as \(\eta=-\ln[\tan(\frac{\theta}{2})]\), rapidity is defined as \(y=0.5\,\ln[(E+p_{\mathrm{Z}})/(E-p_{\mathrm{Z}})]\), where \(E\) is the energy and \(p_{\mathrm{Z}}\) is the \(z\)-component of the momentum, and transverse energy is defined as \(E_{\mathrm{T}}=E\sin\theta\).

The ATLAS inner detector (ID) comprises a pixel detector closest to the beamline, a semiconductor tracker (SCT), and a straw-tube transition radiation tracker at radii up to 108 cm. A thin solenoid surrounding the ID provides an axial 2 T field enabling the measurement of charged particle momenta. The overall ID acceptance spans the full azimuthal range in \(\phi\), and the range \(|\eta|<2.5\) for particles originating near the nominal LHC interaction region. The insertable \(B\) layer [7] (IBL), a new addition to the inner detector for Run 2, consists of 14 tilted staves overlapping in \(\phi\) inserted between a new beam pipe and a new inner support tube (IST) inside the previous inner pixel layer (\(B\)-layer). The IBL has been installed to improve the impact parameter resolution.

The high-granularity electromagnetic (EM) and hadronic calorimeters are composed of multiple sub-detectors spanning \(|\eta|\leq 4.9\). The EM barrel calorimeter uses a liquid argon (LAr) active medium and lead absorbers. In the region \(|\eta|<1.7\), the hadronic (tile) calorimeter is constructed from steel absorber and scintillator tiles and is separated into 64 modules \(\phi\) in the barrel (\(|\eta|<1.0\)) and extended barrel (\(0.8<|\eta|<1.7\)) sections. The calorimeter end-cap (\(1.375<|\eta|<3.2\)) and forward (\(3.1<|\eta|<4.9\)) regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both EM and hadronic energy measurements.

## 3 Data and Monte Carlo simulation

Early LHC Run 2 data are used to assess the performance and understanding of the inputs to jet reconstruction and the properties of the resulting jets through comparisons to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, as described in Section 3.2. The selection criteria, including the trigger criteria used to collect the data online, are described in Section 3.3.

### Data sample

The data were collected during the first LHC stable beams runs at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV in June 2015 with the ATLAS tracking detectors, calorimeters, and magnets operational at nominal conditions. The LHC delivered 38 bunches of protons in each beam which provided, on average, approximately 20 simultaneous \(pp\) interactions per bunch crossing (pile-up) in ATLAS. A total integrated luminosity of approximately 6.4 pb\({}^{-1}\) was collected during this period and is used for the performance assessments discussed below. The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity is \(\pm 9\%\). It is derived, following a methodology similar to that detailed in Ref. [8], from a preliminary calibration of the luminosity scale using a pair of \(x-y\) beam-separation scans performed in June 2015.

To collect data events where the leading jet has transverse momentum in the range \(25<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}<50\) GeV, an online criterion was imposed requiring at least one jet with \(E_{\mathrm{T}}>15\) GeV in the high level trigger (HLT) system. Due to the very high rate of such events and the limited bandwidth available, only approximately 0.22 nb\({}^{-1}\)of integrated luminosity was recorded by this trigger. For higher offline \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) ranges, a single HLT jet trigger that requires \(E_{\mathrm{T}}>55\) GeV (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}>60\) GeV) is used for collect events with leading jet in the the range \(60<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}<100\) GeV (\(160<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}<300\) GeV) and for which approximately 32 nb\({}^{-1}\)(450 nb\({}^{-1}\)) of integrated luminosity was recorded for analysis. In all cases, the offline \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) selection is above the trigger threshold.

### Monte Carlo simulation

MC simulation is used to compare to the data collected by ATLAS during the first week of stable beams at the LHC. In all cases, events are passed through the full GEANT4[9] detector simulation of ATLAS [10] after the simulation of the parton shower and hadronization processes. Following the detector simulation, the identical event, jet, and track selection criteria are applied to both the MC simulation and to the data. PYTHIA 8.186 [11] interfaced to EvtGen 1.2[12] is used for the majority of comparisons presented here and is used with the ATLAS A14 tune [13] and the NNPDF23LO PDF set [14]. Using a 48 bunch structure and overlaying additional soft \(pp\) collisions, pile-up is also simulated for all samples with PYTHIA 8.186 using the ATLAS A2 tune [15] and the MSTW2008LO PDF set [16]. Additional pile-up events are overlaid onto the hard-scattering event according to the measured distribution of the average number \(\langle\mu\rangle\) of \(pp\) interactions per bunch crossing in the recorded data sample and using a 48 bunch structure. Simulated events are reweighted such that the MC distribution of \(\langle\mu\rangle\) agrees with the data, as measured by the luminosity detectors in ATLAS [17; 18]. For each measured distribution presented below, the corresponding distribution from the MC simulation is normalised to have the same integral as the data.

### Object reconstruction and calibration

The anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with a radius parameter of \(R=0.4\) is used to reconstruct jets with a four-momentum recombination scheme, using topo-clusters as inputs. Jet energy is calibrated to the hadronic scale with the effect of pile-up removed, as detailed in Ref. [19]. The direction of a jet is also corrected in order to point back to the identified hard-scatter vertex and eliminate biases in \(\eta\). This vertex is defined as the vertex with the highest sum of squared track \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

Charged particle tracks are reconstructed as detailed in Refs. [20, 21]. A subset of tracks with transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>500\) MeV is selected for study in the context of jets using the loose tracking criteria [22]. Each track is required to either be used in the fit to create the primary vertex, or the track is not used in any vertex fit and the longitudinal impact parameter with respect to the primary vertex satisfies \(|z_{0}\sin\theta|<3.0\,\mathrm{mm}\). Tracks are associated to calorimeter jets following the ghost association procedure [23] which consists of assigning tracks to jets by adding tracks with infinitesimal \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) to the jet clustering process. For results involving associated tracks, only jets with \(|\eta|<2.1\) are used in order to ensure that the tracks near the edge of the jet are within the inner detector acceptance of \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\).

Muon segments are partial tracks constructed from hits in the muon spectrometer chambers which intersect with the regions of activity identified by the trigger chambers [24, 25]. They are associated to the jets using a similar ghost association procedure as explained above for tracks. The number of muon segments (\(N_{\mathrm{segments}}^{\mu}\)) behind a jet is used to characterise and correct for the energy not fully contained within the calorimeter in the global sequential calibration scheme [26].

Jets are required to fulfill the so-called "bad loose" set of quality criteria [27] designed to reject jets originating from non-collision backgrounds and detector readout problems. To mitigate the pile-up contamination, jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}<50\) GeV are required to have a jet-vertex-tagger [28] value greater than 0.64.

## 4 Inclusive jet kinematic distributions

This section presents comparisons of the measured and simulated jet kinematic distributions in the early Run 2 data. Distributions of the transverse momentum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\)), pseudorapidity (\(\eta_{\mathrm{det}}\)) and azimuthal angle (\(\phi\)) for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}>25\) GeV are presented in Figure 1. The pseudorapidity shown, \(\eta_{\mathrm{det}}\), is calculated using the direction of the jet centroid relative to the centre of the detector, while the jet rapidity, \(y\), includes a correction of the jet direction relative to the reconstructed hard-scatter vertex. The detector pseudorapidity better corresponds to the location of the jet within the detector, while \(y\) better corresponds to the properties of the underlying physics and hence typically is used in physics analyses. Numerically these values are quite close to each other. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) distribution is shown for jets with central rapidity, \(|y|<2.1\). The MC simulation typically describes the relative shapes and yields of the data distributions in Figure 1 to within about 10%. Two specific regions of the detector show large differences between data and MC simulation: the pseudorapidity region near the gap region between the barrel and extended barrels of the tile calorimeter (\(|\eta_{\mathrm{det}}|\approx 1.4\)) and the forward region (\(3.1<|\eta|<4.9\)). In the case of the gap region, a larger number of high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) events are observed in the data than predicted by the simulation. Conversely, in the forward region, a larger number of jets is predicted compared to what is observed. In both cases, the relative differences reach up to 50% for certain narrow bins in \(\eta_{\mathrm{det}}\). For all following distributions, except for distributions specifically of \(\eta_{\mathrm{det}}\), the region between \(1.2<|\eta_{\mathrm{det}}|<1.8\) has been removed. This regionis readout by special scintillation counters of the Tile calorimeter that have had front-end electronics adjustments since Run 1. It is therefore expected that in this region effects that impact the inclusive jet kinematic distributions presented here will not be well-reproduced by the MC simulations until additional tuning is performed. The \(\phi\) distribution in Figure 1(c) is well-modelled by the MC simulation, exhibiting maximum deviations between the data and MC of approximately 10%.

In addition to the kinematic distributions above, Figure 2 shows the spatial distribution of jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}>25\) and within \(|\eta_{\mathrm{det}}|<4.5\). The Tile gap region has been removed to better see other features.

## 5 Inputs to jet reconstruction and jet properties

Understanding the modeling of the inputs to jet reconstruction is critical in order to understand the resulting description of jet properties by the MC simulation. This section describes both in detail, first focusing on the properties of top-clusters and tracks which are used as inputs to the jet reconstruction and then describing the modeling of the structure and topology of the resulting jets.

Figure 2: \(\eta_{\text{det}}-\phi_{\text{det}}\) distributions for jets above \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}>25\) GeV for both data (top) and PYTHIA 8 MC (bottom). The MC prediction is normalized to the data.

The multiplicity and properties of the calorimeter top-clusters that form a jet determine its internal structure. Figure 3 presents the top-cluster multiplicity in jets with \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet}>25\) and \(|y|<2.1\). The dependence of the mean top-cluster multiplicity on \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet}\), \(\eta\), and \(\phi\) are also shown. No minimum energy or \(p_{\rm T}\) selection is placed on these top-clusters. The MC is shifted with respect to the data when looking at the number of constituents, as seen in Figure 3(a). The MC simulation also overestimates the number of constituents in each jet across the full range of \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet}\) considered here, as well as across \(\eta\) and \(\phi\), as seen in Figure 3(b), Figure 3(c) and Figure 3(d), respectively. It should be pointed out that because no transverse momentum criteria are imposed prior to counting the clusters, this observable is sensitive to several effects that are difficult to model such as soft particle production spectra and rates, low \(p_{\rm T}\) energy response and resolution, as well as pile-up and calorimeter noise. The differences observed in the total top-cluster multiplicity within a jet are likely due to differences in low energy constituents, while the studies of the hard structure such as the leading cluster energy fraction in Figure 4 exhibit better agreement. Thus, the primary impact of these differences will be on the description provided by MC simulation for jet internal structure that is sensitive to the soft components of the jet.

Figure 3: (a) Topo-cluster multiplicity for jets within \(|y|<2.1\) in three \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet}\) ranges, \(25<p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet}<50\), \(60<p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet}<100\), and \(160<p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet}<300\). All distributions are scaled to \(6.4\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The MC prediction is normalized to the data for these distributions.

In addition to the spatial distribution and multiplicity of top-clusters, the kinematics of the individual clusters are important for understanding the jet structure; in particular, as they relate to the total \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\). Figure 4 shows the distribution and dependence on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) of the fraction of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) carried by the most energetic cluster in the jet, referred to as \(f_{\mathrm{clus}}\). Since jets are characterised by dense energetic cores, a significant fraction of a jet's momentum can easily be carried by a single cluster. The observed distribution of \(f_{\mathrm{clus}}\), as well as that expected from MC simulation, indicates that between 20% and 30% of the jet momentum is typically contained within a single cluster. The spectrum from data generally has more jets in the large \(f_{\mathrm{clus}}\) tail than that from the MC simulation. But against \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) the mean \(f_{\mathrm{clus}}\) is well modelled in MC.

Charged hadrons constitute a significant fraction of the constituents of a jet, and therefore it is useful to consider the multiplicity and properties of charged particle tracks that are associated to a jet as described in Section 3.3. Figure 5 presents the multiplicity of tracks with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{track}}>500\) matched to jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}>25\) and \(|y|<2.1\). Moreover, the dependence of the mean of the matched track multiplicity on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) is also shown. The bulk of the multiplicity distribution exhibit good agreement between data and MC, despite of some discrepancies in the tails. The mean value of that distribution as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) is well-modelled. The rise of the mean number of matched tracks as \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) increases is also well described by the MC simulation; an improvement over the situation seen in Run 1. The implications of these observations are that the details of the charged particle multiplicity and charged energy fraction (see Figure 6) can be incorporated into the jet energy calibration sequence [26], either directly or indirectly, as well as used in selection and identification criteria, for example for quark/gluon separation [29].

Figure 6 shows both the charged track \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) fraction, \(f_{\mathrm{track}}\), defined as the ratio of the sum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of all matched tracks (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{track}}>500\)) to \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\), as well as the dependence of the mean track \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) fraction on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}>25\) and \(|y|<0.8\). The bulk of the distribution is reproduced by the MC simulation to with 10% of that observed in data. This indicates that the MC is able to provide a good description of the track transverse momentum contained within these jets. In particular, the mean of the distribution is modelled well by the MC simulation. At large values of \(f_{\mathrm{track}}\) (\(f_{\mathrm{track}}\sim 1.1\)) the observed disagreements between

data and MC simulation - for example, in the highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) selection shown here - suggest that effects due to the track reconstruction may be playing a role that is not accurately modelled by the simulation. Interestingly, the shape of the distribution beyond \(\sim 1.4\) track \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) fraction, although statistically limited, is reasonably described by the MC simulation.

The dependence of jet reconstruction and jet properties on nearby jets is another important consideration. An observable sensitive to these effects is the minimal angular distance in \((\eta,\phi)\)-space to the closest jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}>20\) GeV, for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}>25\) GeV and \(|y|<0.8\). The distribution of this observable is shown in Figure 7. Differences between the data and MC simulation are well under control, with maximum deviations of 50% in just a very few cases. The shape of the bulk of the distributions agree to within better than 10%.

Studies of the longitudinal energy deposition by layer are performed because of the critical role this jet property plays in both calibration and jet energy resolution. Figure 8 presents both the distribution and its dependence on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) of the energy deposited in the first layer of the central hadronic tile calorimeter, for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}>25\) GeV and \(|y|<0.8\). Since this is the first layer of the calorimeter outside of the cryostat, a good description of this jet property implies both a decent understanding of the longitudinal jet energy profile as well as an appropriate dead material description of the magnet system. As shown in Figure 8, the energy distribution agrees very well with data besides the low tail region for the highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) slice. This excellent agreement can be seen in the mean energy deposited distribution in this layer as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\), as it is accurately modelled across the range of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) accessible to this measurement. The small differences between the measurements and the MC simulation in the region near \(100<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}<150\) GeV are due to low statistics in the data.

Figure 9 extends the study of the longitudinal energy deposition of a jet to the fraction of the measured energy deposited in different calorimeter layers in the central region. The mean value of the fraction of energy deposited in each layer is presented as a function of the full calibrated jet energy for four layers of the central calorimeter region: the first two layers of the central EM calorimeter and the first two layers for the central hadronic tile calorimeter. The MC simulation provides a good description of the data.

The transverse profile of a jet can be studied by the observable known as jet width, which is the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-weighted average \(\Delta R\) distance between the constituents and the jet axis, Both jet width definitions using topo-clusters and associated tracks are plotted in Figure 10 and Figure 11 respectively, with the latter as an important input to jet energy calibration. There is a slight overestimation of the calorimeter-based jet width by the MC simulation, as shown in Figure 10. The track-based width (Figure 11) is in very good agreement, and the average values of both distributions are generally well modelled for higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) jets.

(b), (d) Dependence of the mean jet width using matched tracks on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\). The error bars only reflect the statistical uncertainty.

Proper modeling of the number of muon segments hit behind a jet is important for reconstructing the total jet energy, as information is lost when a jet enters the muon chambers. Figure 12 presents the distribution of \(N_{\mathrm{segments}}^{\mu}\), as well as it's average dependence on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\), \(\eta\), and \(E^{\mathrm{jet}}\). In the \(N_{\mathrm{segments}}^{\mu}\) distribution (Figure 12(a)), jets with \(N_{\mathrm{segments}}^{\mu}=0\) have been removed for better clarity of the distribution. For all \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) slices there were on order \(10^{3}\) jets that do not punch through. All other plots in Figure 12 include jets that have \(N_{\mathrm{segments}}^{\mu}=0\). Overall, data and MC simulation distributions agree quite well, with no more than a 10% disagreement across the \(\eta\) range.

## 6 Conclusions

Preliminary results have been shown on the study of jet properties that characterize or impact the jet reconstruction and calibration using the first data collected by the ATLAS experiment at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. Measured distributions of representative jet properties have been shown and compared to predictions from Monte Carlo simulation events using the full ATLAS detector simulation.

Distributions characterizing the constituents of jets are generally well described by the Monte Carlo simulation for jets built from topological clusters. The kinematic properties of the internal jet structure, including charged particle track momentum distributions and longitudinal energy deposition, have been examined with good agreement observed in most cases. Important differences in the modelling of constituent multiplicities and the extrema of distributions of \(f_{\text{track}}\) and the calorimeter jet width merit further investigation. Observables sensitive to energy leakage from the calorimeter into the muon system are also modeled accurately by the simulation.
