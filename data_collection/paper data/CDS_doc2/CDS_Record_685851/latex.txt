## 1 Introduction

In this note we describe a study of a sample of 500000 QCD jets, with \(|\eta|\ <0.5\) and \(p_{T}\ >20\) GeV. Most of these jets were run through a full GEANT simulation of the ATLAS detector (old concept B of the inner tracker as shown in Fig. 1). The main purpose of this study was to estimate the nature and relative importance of the main backgrounds to inclusive electron searches at LHC, for a magnetic detector such as ATLAS.

The importance of such a study is due to the fact that the electron to jet ratio is expected to be \(\sim 10^{-5}\) at LHC for transverse momenta around 20 to 50 GeV. This ratio is about two orders of magnitude worse than at existing hadron colliders, where the electron to jet ratio has been measured to be \(\sim\ 10^{-3}\) at \(p_{T}\ \sim 40\) GeV. A consequence of this rather favourable ratio was that single charged hadron backgrounds were found to be small, since the inclusive charged pion to jet ratio is of order \(10^{-3}\) due to fragmentation. As we shall see in this note, this situation is different at LHC, at least for low transverse momenta, where the rejection of the electromagnetic calorimeter cuts against charged hadrons is only around 100.

Previous studies have already yielded interesting though only partial answers. In particular it has been shown that a rejection of 1000 to 3000 against QCD jets can be achieved using information from the calorimeter alone [1, 2, 3], for transverse momenta around 40 GeV. Another study [4] showed that backgrounds from electron pairs from Dalitz decays or photon conversions in the detector material can be reduced to a level well below the inclusive prompt electron rate. In particular this study showed that a detector without magnetic field would be in a better position to reject such backgrounds and that a detector with moderate magnetic field would be in a slightly better position than a detector with a very strong magnetic field.

Section 2 of this note describes the detector setup used and Section 3 the analysis steps, using at first calorimeter criteria similar to the level-1 and level-2 algorithms being discussed at present, and then using track reconstruction, E/p matching, preshowerinformation and finally TRD/T selection criteria. The results are summarised in Section 4, which also discusses the limitations of the simulations performed and possible future plans.

## 2 Event simulation

The sample of two-jet events was generated using PYTHIA (version 5.6). Parton level cuts were applied to the hard-scattering transverse momentum (\(p_{T}^{hard}~{}>~{}20\) GeV) and to the rapidity of both jets (\(|\eta|~{}<~{}0.5\)). To minimise the CPU time spent running GEANT, a preliminary selection was applied to the generated events at the level of final state particles, requiring at least one jet with more than 17 GeV of transverse energy contained in a cone of size 0.12 \(\times\) 0.12 in \(\eta\times\phi\) space. Since the final calorimeter cuts used in this study require 16 GeV of the electromagnetic energy to be deposited in a nonet of cells, corresponding to a square of 0.06 \(\times\) 0.06 in \(\eta\times\phi\) space, this simple particle level cut does not bias the results presented in this study.

The remaining events were then run through a full GEANT simulation of the barrel ATLAS B set-up, which includes :

- 6 layers of inner silicon tracker (SITV)

- TRD with 1m long straws parallel to the beam axis

- 6 layers of outer silicon tracker (SIT)

- the presently standard version of integrated (coil+preshower+LAr calorimeter) system, with a cell size of 0.02 \(\times\) 0.02 in \(\eta\times\phi\) space.

The calorimeter response was calibrated with 20 GeV electrons and pions to yield the correct total reconstructed energy :

- \(E_{measured}=6.7\times E_{observed}\) in the electromagnetic part

- \(E_{measured}=34.\times E_{observed}\) in the hadronic part.

To evaluate the electron reconstruction efficiency we used a sample of 3000 single electrons of 20 GeV energy at \(\eta\)= 0 and a sample of about 300 such electrons overlapped with 40 minimum bias events. To study some aspects of charged hadron rejection with more statistics, a separate sample of 10 000 pions with the same \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) has been used.

## 3 Event analysis

The simulated events were filtered according to rough approximations of the level-1 and level-2 calorimeter algorithms, which may be implemented in the future in ATLAS. After filtering, the full calorimeter information was used to select possible electron candidates and was then followed by a high-\(p_{T}\) track selection and E/p matching. In the last analysis steps, rejection factors specific to the preshower and the TRD were studied.

### Filtering using level-1 and partial level-2

In a first filter step, with the aim to condense the interesting events onto only a few cassettes, a level-1 calorimeter trigger algorithm similar to the one described in [3] was applied to the jets reconstructed using the GEANT calorimeter hits. This algorithm operates with trigger cells of 0.10 \(\times\) 0.10 size in \(\eta\times\phi\) space and requires a transverse energy deposition above 14 GeV to be found in a sliding window of two adjacent cells.

An "isolation" energy was calculated as the summed energy of both the electromagnetic energy in a rim of 12 electromagnetic trigger cells surrounding the trigger region and the hadronic energy in all the corresponding 16 trigger cells (see fig. 2a). This energy was required to be less than 10 GeV. The main difference with the first level trigger algorithm described in [3] is due to the fact that no threshold was applied to cells used in calculating this level-1 "isolation" energy.

The rejection obtained against jets of 15 to 20 GeV transverse energy was not sufficient using these cuts alone. A sizeable additional rejection was obtained by requiring more than 16 GeV transverse energy, corrected using the preshower information and suitably renormalised over a nonet of cells (a good approximation of a typical level-2 calorimeter cut, which would use the full calorimeter granularity). Even after this cut, 2.616 jets (about 0.5% of the initial sample) survived.

### Further calorimeter selection

A level-2 type calorimeter isolation was applied to these surviving jets, requiring the electromagnetic energy in the cells surrounding the nonet over a square of size \(0.18\,\times\,0.18\) in \(\eta\times\phi\) space to be less than 5 GeV, and the total hadronic energy over the full square to be also less than 5 GeV (see fig. 2b). The distributions of these two "isolation" variables are shown in fig. 3, for jets and for single electrons with a pile-up of 40 minimum bias events. Calorimeter noise was not included in these simulations, which explains that no energy is seen in the hadronic compartment for single electrons even in the presence of pile-up. Fig. 3 shows that not much is gained by these level-2 isolation cuts, when applying them after the level-1 cuts.

Further improvements in the jet rejection can be expected from shower shape analysis. To check this possibility we have studied the distribution of the electromagnetic shower radius and of the fraction of the nonet electromagnetic energy deposited in the first compartment of the electromagnetic calorimeter. This was studied for the jet sample but also for 20 GeV charged pions, which survived the calorimeter selection described above. Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show that the transverse size of the shower cannot be used to reject much further electromagnetic jets and especially charged pions.

Moreover, even a cut, requiring that 80% of the nonet energy be deposited in the first compartment, provides only an additional rejection of \(\sim\,2\) against charged pions, and very little against the surviving jets, which are mostly composed of \(\pi^{0}\)'s (see fig. 6).

Table 1 shows the effect of the various cuts described above, in terms of reduction of the QCD jet sample and charged pion sample and of efficiency for electrons in the absence or presence of pile-up. Only the QCD jets were run through the level-1 + level-2 filter cuts. The efficiency of the first stage of calorimeter cuts is higher for single electrons in the presence of pile-up because the extra energy seen in the trigger nonet of cells allows more events to pass the threshold cut of 16 GeV. This apparent increase in efficiency should in effect be dampened by the fraction of events which do not pass the level-1 isolation cuts, a number which was not estimated in this analysis. After all calorimeter cuts, 879 jets of the original sample survive. This corresponds to a rejection of \(\sim\,600\), a value which can be compared to the rejection of \(\sim\,1000\) to 3000 obtained in the studies of [1, 2, 3], for jets of \(p_{T}\,>\,40\) GeV.

### Track finding

We then proceeded to search for high-\(p_{T}\) tracks matching the calorimeter cluster. The global pattern recognition program used is based on the TRD/T tracker and provides highly efficient continuous tracking, with a very low rate of fake tracks even at the highest LHC luminosities [5].

In order to minimise computer time, the program was run using the candidate calorimeter cluster to define a road of \(\pm\) 0.2 in \(\phi\), which minimises losses due to bremsstrahlung. In the barrel region, the TRD/T does not provide any information in \(\eta\) (or z), but a road of \(\pm\) 0.2 in \(\eta\) was also defined from the calorimeter cluster, for hit association in the silicon layers at a later stage. The TRD/T track reconstruction was performed searching only for tracks with \(p_{T}\)\(>\) 10 GeV and a standard transverse vertex constraint was used.

The distribution of the number of TRD/T track candidates found within this road is shown in fig. 6(a), for the 879 jets passing all the calorimeter cuts. As expected, most of these jets do not have any high-\(p_{T}\) track pointing to them, a confirmation of the fact that they mostly consist of \(\pi^{0}\)'s. Fig. 6(b) shows the same distribution for a subsample of the QCD jets passing only loose calorimeter selection cuts. The track multiplicity has risen considerably and this may have serious implications for the philosophy/architecture of the level-2 algorithms.

In this study, no use was made of possible TRD/T drift-time information. The distribution of the ratio of the reconstructed track transverse momentum to the true track \(p_{T}\) is shown in fig. 7(a), for single electrons of 20 GeV. To improve the momentum accuracy, we then used the available information from hits in the inner and outer silicon tracking layers. We could not implement directly the full vector pattern recognition described in [6], but we instead associated silicon tracker hits to the TRD/T track candidate, using a road of \(\pm\) 1 mm in the \(\phi\)-direction and \(\pm\) 5 cm in the z-direction. All hits found within this road were attributed to the track candidate, which was then fitted, using a helix-fit, as described in [6].

Fig. 8 shows the improvement in momentum resolution achieved by successively including the SITV and SIT hits, for 20 GeV electrons:

\end{table}
Table 1: _Event selection statistics for different samples_* fig. 8d: same as above, including SIT hits.

The final momentum reconstruction accuracy is 1.3% (1.6%) for isolated 20 GeV pions (electrons). The electrons shown in fig. 8d display a tail due to bremsstrahlung, which we did not attempt to eliminate using the procedure described in [6]. The accuracies found for momentum reconstruction are close to those quoted in the ATLAS LoI, but further studies are needed to improve the global track fitting. This is particularly true in the case of pile-up. The efficiency of track reconstruction for 20 GeV electrons was found to be 93.9% - 95.4% with and without pile-up.

Only 93 jets survive at this stage, as shown in Table 1, and they are labelled as electrons, converted photons or hadrons, depending on the nature of the particle matching the candidate "electron" track. Table 2 shows that, at this stage of the analysis cuts, the remaining sample is subdivided equally into these three categories. The electrons arise mainly from direct b-decay and their rate will be used in the following Section to extract an efficiency for reconstruction of non-isolated electrons.

### E/p selection

Fig. 9 shows the expected E/p distributions for the three categories of surviving events, conversions (fig. 9a), hadrons (fig. 9b) and electrons from b-decay (fig. 9c), and for single electrons in the absence of pile-up (fig. 9d). A cut \(0.8<E/p<1.2\), which is quite efficient for single isolated electrons in the presence of pile-up [6], substantially reduces the events in all three categories (see Tables 1 and 2). Events are most often rejected, because the cluster energy is larger than the "electron" track momentum due to accompanying photons. The largest reductions are observed for conversions and hadrons, whereas the electrons from b-decay are rejected in only \(\sim 25\%\) of the cases.

Since the width of the E/p distribution is dominated by the calorimeter measurement for this particular sample, and since the tails of the E/p distribution are dominated by bremsstrahlung effects (which can however be minimised using the measurement of the shower position in the calorimeter [6]), we do not expect a tighter E/p cut to be very practical.

### Preshower selection

After all calorimeter and tracking cuts, the remaining background from QCD jets is dominated by charged hadrons, within the large statistical uncertainties (Table 2). Systematic uncertainties are also large and will be discussed in Section 4. One may expect substantial additional rejection may be obtained by using the preshower information, which was therefore studied in detail at this stage of the analysis. We clearly expect some rejection by requiring a substantial charge seen in the preshower layers, but this rejection is obviously strongly correlated to the exact sequence of cuts applied before, using the calorimeter information.

Fig. 10 shows the distribution of energy seen in the preshower detector, summed over both layers, for electrons and charged pions, which passed all the previous analysis cuts. A cut, requiring this energy to be larger than 200 MeV, rejects the surviving charged pions by a factor \(\sim 2\) for an electron efficiency of 99%. If no cut on the longitudinal shower development is applied beforehand, this rejection increases to 3.3. The factor 2 obtained for single pions of 20 GeV increases to 2.5 for pions of 40 GeV (fixing the preshower cut to a fixed electron efficiency).

Only one of the 7 charged hadron background events from the QCD jet sample is rejected by this preshower cut. In the following Section, we will however assume that the preshower rejection is a factor 2, trusting the higher statistics single charged hadron sample.

Finally, we conclude this discussion on the preshower rejection by noting that, as expected, the matching in space between track and preshower cluster is good for all the surviving events. Possibly some additional rejection can be obtained using preshower isolation, but larger jet statistics would be needed to estimate such a gain, which would anyhow suffer from it's own systematic uncertainties due to fragmentation and detector modelling.

### TRD/T selection

The remaining charged hadron background can only be further reduced using the TRD/T information. A rejection of 10 for an electron efficiency of 90% can be achieved in the barrel TRD/T even at the highest LHC luminosities, using high energy hits from transition radiation photons (TR hits) [7].

It has also been shown that the TRD/T can provide a reliable algorithm to further reject conversions/Dalitz decays by identifying the second electron, usually of much lower energy, as a partner (opposite charge, same \(\eta\), same \(\phi\) at vertex) but also as an electron (large number of TR hits) for \(p_{T}\ >0.5\) GeV. A rejection of 15 for an electron efficiency larger than 95% was obtained at high luminosity.

The last line in Table 2 shows the expected levels of residual backgrounds from QCD jets after TRD/T selection, assuming the rejections quoted above. The understanding of the exact level of expected charged hadron background is a sensitive point and an analysis of charged hadron test beam data at various energies, using the RD6 and RD3 prototypes in the H6 test beam, will be presented in an addendum to this note.

The events surviving the full sequence of cuts (third line of Table 2) were all examined on an event display (with the GEANT hits and the reconstructed TRD/T tracks) 1. From the event display we conclude that the only remaining distinctive feature of these QCD jet residual background events is that the "electron" track is often surrounded by other relatively high-\(p_{T}\) charged tracks. Therefore a track isolation cut would further improve the signal to background ratio, but at the expense of significant losses for electrons from b-decay.

\begin{tabular}{||l||c|c|c||} \hline  & Electrons & Conversions & Hadrons \\ \hline \hline Calorimeter + high-\(p_{T}\) track & 31 & 32 & 30 \\ \hline \(0.8<E/p<1.2\) & 23 & 3 & 7 \\ \hline Preshower & 22 & 2 & 6 \\ \hline TRD/T & 20 & \(<0.2\) & \(<0.6\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 4 Conclusions and future plans

In order to reach a conclusion from the study described in this note, we have to translate the rates of residual backgrounds from QCD jets into cross-sections. We shall then compare these cross-sections to those expected from prompt electron sources within the same kinematical cuts (isolated electrons from W-decay and non-isolated electrons from c,b-decay).

As discussed above, the QCD jets were generated with the following parton level cuts: \(p_{T}^{hard}\ >\ 15\) GeV and \(|\eta|\ <\ 0.5\) (for both jets). The total sample corresponds to a cross-section, \(\sigma_{2j}\ \sim\ 32\ \mu\)b, for 250000 events (and 500000 jets). The cross-section for inclusive jets, with \(p_{T}^{hard}\ >\ 15\) GeV and \(|\eta|\ <\ 0.5\), is of course much higher, \(\sigma_{1j}\ \sim\ 280\ \mu\)b, if the second jet is allowed to be anywhere in pseudorapidity.

For the same kinematical cuts, similar cross-sections can be obtained for direct \(b\overline{b}\) production: \(\sigma_{2b}\ \sim\ 0.25\ \mu\)b and \(\sigma_{1b}\ \sim\ 1.2\ \mu\)b.

The cross-sections for the residual QCD jet backgrounds can now be extracted from the above numbers and those shown in Table 2. Tables 3 and 4 show the results before and after TRD/T cuts, for \(|\eta|\ _{e}\ <\ 0.5\) and for \(p_{T}^{e}\ >\ 15\) GeV and \(p_{T}^{e}\ >\ 20\) GeV. In the cases where few or no events were found, the cross-sections quoted correspond to 90% confidence level upper limits.

Most of the numbers in these Tables suffer from large uncertainties, which are explained below :

a) The cross-section for electrons from W-decay is uncertain to within a factor of \(\sim 2\), due to structure functions [8].

b) The cross-sections for inclusive leptons from c,b-decay are even more uncertain, both before and after the cuts discussed in this note. If we compute the rates expected for electrons (or muons) from c,b-decay for \(p_{T}^{e}\ >\ 20\) GeV, using inclusive dijet production in PYTHIA, we find a cross-section of 7.9 \(\pm\) 2.1 nb, of which 6.8 nb is from b-decay. The error quoted is entirely due to Monte-Carlo statistics. From direct \(b\overline{b}\) production, we obtain a cross-section of 2.3 \(\pm\) 1.0 nb, thus suggesting that a large fraction of \(\sim\) 70% of leptons from b-decay originate from gg \(\rightarrow\) gg production, with g \(\rightarrow\)\(b\overline{b}\) splitting.

A calculation performed for single inclusive muon rates [9], yields a cross-section of 168 nb for \(p_{T}^{\mu}\ >\ 20\) GeV and \(|\eta|\ _{\mu}\ <\ 3.0\). The PYTHIA cross-section, extrapolated to \(|\eta|\ _{\mu}\ <\ 3.0\), yields a cross-section of 196 nb, in good agreement with ref. [9]. We recall that the cross-section for direct \(b\overline{b}\) production is predicted to be \(\sim\) 150 \(\mu\)b in PYTHIA. The literature expects a total cross-section for \(b\overline{b}\) production of 100 to 700 \(\mu\)b [10].

Finally additional uncertainties on the expected measured rates for electrons from c,b-decay arise from the detector modelling itself since most of the electrons are non-isolated. For the cuts of Table 3, the efficiency is \(\epsilon_{b}\ =\ 19\ \pm\ 6\%\). The calorimeter efficiency is about 30% and the tracking and E/p matching efficiency is about 60% (see Table 2).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||l||c|c|c|c||} \hline Cross-sections & W to e & c,b to e & Conversions & Hadrons \\ in nb & \(\epsilon_{e}\) = 88\% & \(\epsilon_{e}\) = 19\% & & \\ \hline \hline \(p_{T}>15\) GeV & 2.9 & 13.5 \(\pm\) 3.2 & \(<3.3\) & 3.9 \(\pm\) 1.4 \\ \hline \(p_{T}>20\) GeV & 2.6 & 6.4 \(\pm\) 2.2 & \(<1.4\) & 2.0 \(\pm\) 1.1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: _Expected cross-sections for various processes before TRD/T cuts (\(|\eta|\ <\ 0.5\))_Since the overall uncertainty on the expected measured rates for electrons from c,b-decay may therefore be as large as a factor 5 or more, we shall compare in the following the residual QCD jet background rates to the less uncertain one for electrons from W-decay.

c) These background cross-sections themselves also suffer from large systematic uncertainties, in addition to the presently large statistical uncertainties. The QCD jet cross-section itself is of course very uncertain at these low transverse momenta. In addition the results are very sensitive to the detector modelling (how well will the calorimeter reject charged hadrons in reality?) and to a lesser extent to fragmentation (the jet fragmentation functions measured at LEP are not precisely known for \(z>0.8\)[11]).

Table 3 shows that, for \(p_{T}^{\pi}~{}>~{}20\) GeV, the expected signal and background cross-sections are similar. Given the large uncertainties, we believe that this justifies the need for an independent electron identification criterion, namely that obtained with the TRD/T, which will work even at the highest LHC luminosities.

Table 4 shows the expected cross-sections after additional selection criteria based on the TRD/T, requiring electron identification (\(\epsilon_{e}\) = 90% and \(\epsilon_{had}\leq 10\%\)) and no partner electron with \(p_{T}~{}>\) 1 GeV found (\(\epsilon_{e}\) = 95% and \(\epsilon_{conv}\leq 7\%\)). Similar rejections against electron pairs are expected using the vector tracking of Concept A [6], but without the identification of the partner as an electron, a requirement which may well be needed at the highest LHC luminosities. With these last selection criteria, we may hope to achieve the electron identification necessary to isolate inclusive electrons for transverse momenta as low as 20 GeV. The rejection against QCD jets would then be \(\sim~{}10^{6}\), yielding a residual background of \(\sim 20\%\) of the inclusive electron rate expected from W-decay.

The results presented in this study are not very sensitive to luminosity and apply in particular to the initial lower LHC luminosities, where the possibility to use clean samples of inclusive electrons may allow a precise and fast calibration of the energy and momentum measurements, as was originally done by CDF [12]. An accurate E/p calibration in the early stages of data taking, with the possibility to also identify high-\(p_{T}\) J/\(\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) decays to electron pairs, is bound to be extremely useful for both the electromagnetic calorimeter and the overall tracking system. We also recall that the identification of electrons from top quark decay requires an overall rejection of \(10^{5}\) against jets from multijet events [13]. Although part of this rejection may be obtained using a cut on missing transverse energy, we feel that the redundancy available by combining electromagnetic calorimetry, E/p matching and TRD may well turn out to be a major asset for ATLAS.

Present studies on this topic are concentrating on detailed analysis of single hadron test beam data taken at various energies in a combined RD3/RD6 prototype setup in order to compare data with Monte-Carlo simulations. These will be described in an addendum to this note. We are also in the process of launching a production of a large sample of QCD jets in the endcap region of the ATLAS tracking system, in order to assess the
