## 1 Introduction

This document presents several summary plots from the SUSY group, new or updated in November 2018.

## 2 Inclusive/Strong Production

These figures have been updated to include the results of the summer CONF note ATLAS-CONF-2018-041, which used 80 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data. They have also been updated to include the phrase "All limits at 95% CL" on the face of the figure. All of the captions are unchanged.

Figure 1: Exclusion limits at 95% CL based on 13 TeV data in the (gluino, lightest neutralino) mass plane for different simplified models featuring the decay of the gluino to the lightest supersymmetric particle (lightest neutralino or gravitino) either directly or through a cascade chain featuring other SUSY particles with intermediate masses. For each line, the gluino decay mode is reported in the legend and it is assumed to proceed with 100% branching ratio. Some limits depend on additional assumptions on the mass of the intermediate states, as described in the references provided in the plot.

Figure 3: Exclusion limits at 95% CL based on 13 TeV data in the (gluino, lightest neutralino) mass plane for the simplified model where a pair of gluinos are produced, and each decays promptly via an on-shell chargino to a pair of quarks, a W boson, and the lightest neutralino. The chargino mass is assumed to be mid-way between the gluino and neutralino masses. Theoretical signal cross section uncertainties are not included in the limits shown.

Figure 4: Exclusion limits at 95% CL based on 13 TeV data in the (gluino, lightest neutralino) mass plane for the simplified model where a pair of gluinos are produced, and each decays promptly via an the lightest chargino and the second lightest neutralino to a pair of quarks, a W boson, a Z boson, and the lightest neutralino. The assumptions for the masses of the lightest chargino and the second lightest neutralino are reported in the plot. Theoretical signal cross section uncertainties are not included in the limits shown.

## 3 Third Generation

Three new third-generation summary plots are included here. They show a summary of stop decays with different electroweakino configurations, and different sbottom limits for different decay modes and branching fractions.

Figure 5: Exclusion limits at 95% CL in the (lightest stop, lightest neutralino) mass plane for direct stop production. Different assumptions regarding the lightest (LSP) and next to lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) are shown. In the wino model, the wino mass eigenstates (\(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\), \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\)) are twice as heavy as the bino. The results are shown separately for a positive and a negative higgsino mass parameter (\(\mu>0\) and \(\mu<0\)), as this influences the \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) decay branching ratios. The pure wino limit from the ATLAS electroweak jigsaw analysis is also shown in yellow for the same hypothesis on the wino mass eigenstates. The higgsino LSP scenario assumes a mass-splitting amongst the higgsino mass eigenstates (\(\chi_{2}^{0}\), \(\chi_{1}^{\pm}\) and \(\chi_{1}^{0}\)) of 5 GeV. The results are shown separately for different stop left-right mixing, as this influences the \(\tilde{t}_{1}\) decay branching ratios. The pure higgsino limit from the ATLAS electroweak search in scenarios with compressed mass spectra is also superimposed in dark green. The open contours indicate regions of the mass plane not yet explored for that hypothesis.

Figure 6: Exclusion limits at 95% CL in the (lightest sbottom, lightest neutralino) mass plane for direct sbottom production. The lightest neutralino (\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\)) is assumed to be the lightest SUSY particle (LSP). Several different decay scenarios are shown, along with different parameterizations of the intermediate particles in the models.

Figure 7: Exclusion limits at 95% CL in the (lightest sbottom, lightest neutralino) mass plane for direct sbottom production. The lightest neutralino (\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\)) is assumed to be the lightest SUSY particle (LSP). Two different decay scenarios are shown, covering different relative rates of the decays of \(\tilde{b}_{1}\to b\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) and \(\tilde{b}_{1}\to t\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\). In the latter case, the lightest chargino (\(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\)) is assumed to be the next-to-LSP, with a mass almost degenerate with the LSP.
