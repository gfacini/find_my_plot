END CAP GEOMETRY

The Electromagnetic End Cap is mechanically divided into 8 wedge-shaped modules of 45\({}^{0}\) (Figure 11). Each module is also divided into two coaxial wheels, called inner and outer wheels.

Footnote 1: All Figures except 1 and 3 are Color Postscript Figures.

The modules support structure is primarily composed of six rings (outer, intermediate and inner rings, forward and backwards), and two lighter rings which are added on each side of the outer wheel. The outer front and back rings are joined by 16 spacer beams, and the inner front and back rings are joined by a conical shell.

Each End Cap is composed by 384 inner absorbers and 768 outer absorbers. The absorbers have an accordion shape (Figure 2), and they are made of lead sheets clad between two layers of stainless steel adhered to the lead with a glass fiber-epoxi pre-preg material.

Along the external straight edges of the folded absorber, two bars made of composite material are glued (longitudinal bars), and along the folded edges on the acute angles side, another composite bar is attached (transversal bar).

### End Cap Integration

The incorporation of the End Cap in the cryostat is shown on Figure 3. The frame lies on two rails which were formerly located 500 mm below the beam axis, but on the last updated cryostat design they are placed at the level of the beam axis. This matter will be dicussed on paragraph 5.7.7.

### Support Structure

The dimensions of all the rings and spacers frames were supplied by C.P.P.M. (Marseille) on an IGES file (dena200.igs), and the principal dimensions can be seen on Figure 4.

#### 1.2.1 Section properties

The shape of each ring cross-section was extracted from the IGES file cited on paragraph 1.2. As an example, Figure 5 is a zoom of Figure 4 centered on the outer front ring.

For every type of section, the following characteristics have been computed :

* Area
* Center of gravity
* Moments of inertia and product of inertia
* Couple of torsion The properties have been calculated with and without the bolt holes, but only the holed sections have been implemented on the modelization (Table 1).

### Absorbers

The absorbers geometry is now being optimized reflecting the constant lead thickness and other physics factors as the position of the crack between outer and inner wheel, or the total width of the calorimeter.

As no final conclusion has been yet derived from that optimization process, the absorbers parameters (number of waves, wave angles, lzig, folding fillet radius) included on the model reported here, are based on the IGES files supplied by C.P.P.M. (inner_edge.igs, inner_wave.igs, outer_edge.igs and outer_wave.igs), which contain the geometry of half a wave of both inner and outer absorbers for all different End Cap radius. The number of waves considered is 9 for the outer absorber and 12 for the inner absorber. This absorbers geometry corresponds to an intermediate optimization step made by physicists between the ATLAS Technical Proposal geometry, and the final constant lead thickness geometry.

A constant lead thickness of 1.6 mm has been considered, and the pre-preg and stainless steel plates are 0.15 mm and 0.2 mm thick respectively.

As soon as final dimensions will be freezed, the absorbers finite element models will be revised and reported, but from the mechanical point of view,providing no dramatic geometry changes, no major stress-displacements variations are expected.

### Longitudinal and Transversal Bars

The cross-sections of the longitudinal bars are linearly varying with the radius of the End Cap, as the gap between absorbers increases with radius. Table 2 shows the bars dimensions.

## 2 End Cap Materials

All the material properties employed on the finite element model are described on the following paragraphs.

### Room Temperature Properties

#### 2.1.1 Lead, Stainless Steel and Pre-preg

The mechanical and thermal properties of these materials were obtained from LARG-NO-005, after correcting for some transcription errors of the values reported on this note. They are displayed on Table 3, together with the properties of all the materials of the End Cap components which are described below.

#### 2.1.2 Glass Fiber / Epoxi

Longitudinal and transversal bars are simulated as glass fiber/epoxi composite material. The properties were supplied by C.P.P.M. (Table 3).

#### 2.1.3 Aluminium

All the rings except the Intermediate Front are made of aluminium, as well as the spacers frame. The mechanical and thermal properties were obtained from LARG-NO-006, and they are also included in Table 3.

#### 2.1.4 Vectra B230

For the Intermediate Front Ring, the properties of Vectra B230 (liquid crystalline polymer reinforced with carbon fiber) have been used, as they are described on LARG-NO-006 (Table 3).

Investigations are being done at C.P.P.M. with other possible composite or metallic materials.

### Cold Temperature Properties

At liquid argon temperature, T = -186\({}^{0}\) C = 87 K, the elasticity modulus of the majority of the materials increases, so then, for aluminium, lead, stainless steel and glass fiber/epoxi materials, a 12 % increment has been estimated (LARG-NO-006), and for Vectra 230 an absolute enlargement of 10000 MPa is implemented according to the manufacturer information.

## 3 Finite Elements Code

The finite elements software utilized is a general purpose program named ABAQUS/Standard, distributed in Spain by Principia S.A.

## 4 Local Absorber Analysis

The structural behaviour of one isolated absorber is described in this section, because the models of inner and outer absorber will be part of the global model of the whole End Cap structure.

### Model Validation on Prototype Absorber

Some absorbers from the 1993 prototype were tested at C.P.P.M., measuring the displacements induced under different load conditions, in order to know their real stiffness.

The tested prototype absorbers did not have assembled the longitudinal and transversal bars.

Traction tests on acute and obtuse accordion angles, self-weight (dead load) and thermal expansion tests (the absorber was immersed in liquid nitrogen) were performed as reported in LARG-NO-005.

The validation consists on a comparation of the calculated displacements using various modelling techniques, with the experimental results.

#### 4.1.1 Shell Modelling

The first trial was a model built with shell elements (4-nodes doubly curved thin shell elements), named S4R5 in the Abaqus elements library, and with a cross section composed of two steel layers, two pre-preg layers, and one lead layer.

The prototype absorber geometry included on LARG-NO-005 was used, but in our model it has been also taken into account the fillet radius of the waves given by C.P.P.M. (1 mm for optuse and 2 mm for acute angles).

As the lead thickness of the prototype is linearly varying with the absorber length, the model was divided in five zones with different lead thickness in each of them.

The size of the shell model was 3193 nodes and 3060 elements (Figure 6). The model was run with the four kind of loads tested :

* Traction of 385 N on acute angles corner.
* Traction of 385 N on obtuse angles corner.
* Self-weight (gravity).
* T\({}_{i}\) = -196-20 = -216\({}^{0}\) C.

The boundary conditions for traction tests were applied along one of the straight edges of the absorber, in which all degrees of freedom are supressed (clamped edge). The load was applied on each corner of the other straight edge, in direction perpendicular to the waves. For the weight and thermal load cases, isostatic boundary conditions were considered.

The model results are summarized on Table 4, as well as the results for other modelling procedures defined on the following paragraphs. It can be seen that only for the thermal case the comparision is not satisfactory with the shell modelling.

Attempting to obtain more accurate results, a finner mesh on the fillet radius was modelized without significant improvement. Thick shell elements were also tested because in sandwich shells, the transverse shear flexibility can be important even when the sandwich is rather thin, but the results do not rectify.

Thereafter, a non linear analysis was carried out, taking into account the elasto-plastic behaviour of the lead material. The stress-strain curve of lead was taken from the CERN document PPE/1042R/JLC/sb, and it is displayed on Figure 7.

Thermal expansion displacements parallel to the waves (Table 4) were then well simulated (-1.71 mm compared to -1.6 mm), along the deflection perpendicular to the waves still differed considerably from test results.

#### 4.1.2 Solid modelling

Continuum elements may be preferred to modelize composite behaviour when transversal shear effect is predominant, or when the normal strain (perpendicular to the surface) cannot be ignored, specially in regions of complex geometry.

Then a new model of 3 dimensional solid elements (8-nodes brick elements named C3D8 in Abaqus) was constructed. Each layer of the sandwich is simulated with a row of solid elements (Figure 8).

The size of the model was 33119 nodes and 24480 elements.

As on the shell model, non linear analysis was run, and the comparision for thermal loading is much better than on the shell model for the direction perpendicular to the waves, but on the other hand, the results for the weight load are worse than in the shell model (Table 4). The reason for that is the better simulation of the flexural behaviour on the shells than on the solids.

#### 4.1.3 Shell-solid modelling

In order to take the advantages of both shell and solid meshing, a combined model with both type of elements, solids on the fillet radius, and shells on the rest of the model, was produced (Figure 9). The shell-solid transition is modelized with multipoint constraints (MPC).

The size of the model was 29001 nodes and 17680 elements.

The results are the most accurate of all models (Table 4).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]

### Symmetry Boundary Conditions

The symmetry of the End Cap with respect to the vertical plane (OXZ) allows the reduction of the global model size, analysing only half of the structure.

Symmetry boundary conditions shall be applied on the symmetry plane nodes :

* Axis 2 displacement = U2 = 0.
* Axis 1 rotation = U4 = 0
* Axis 3 rotation = U6 = 0

### Support boundary conditions

Inicially, the cryostat supporting rails were located 500 mm below the beam axis, but the last updated drawings show the rails at the level of beam axis.

All the analysis has been carried out with the last configuration, but for the combined gravity+ Archimedes thrust+thermal load case, it has been also calculated the model with the previous configuration of the rails below the beam axis. On paragraph 5.7.7 a comparision between both arrangements is discussed.

The vertical support on the rails is simulated fixing the vertical displacements (U3) on the two outer ring nodes at the level of the rails.

In order to avoid rigid body movements of the model, the beam axis displacements (U1) is also fixed on the front outer ring node at the level of the rails, so as to have isostatic boundary conditions.

All boundary conditions are plotted on Figure 12.

### Substructure/Superelement procedure

The End Cap is composed by 384 identical inner absorbers and 768 identical outer absorbers, so the problem is appropriate to be treated with substructure/superelement concept, which allows a collection of elements (i.e. inner absorber elements) to be grouped together, and all but the _retained degrees of freedom_ eliminated on the basis of linear response within the group, without regard of the rest of the model. Once a substructure (inner and outer substructures) has been created in this way, it is used just like any other

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:15]

The global superelement model has passed successfully this test, being the maximum stress developed less than 0.7 Mpa.

### Mechanical Analysis

#### 5.6.1 Loading : Gravity Load at Room Temperature

In order to estimate the conduct of the End Cap when it is mounted on the cryostat, the global model is loaded with its self-weight at room temperature conditions, calculating the deflections and stresses developed on the components.

The mechanical properties are those defined on paragraph 2.1.

The weight of the absorbers and support frame is calculated by Abaqus program based on the density of the materials, and the volumes of the different elements.

A vertical -9.81 m/s\({}^{2}\) gravity acceleration is applied.

The weight of the kaptons is included in the model by increasing the density of the absorbers lead. The estimated weight of the kaptons is 0.44 kg per inner absorber, and 1.5 kg per outer absorber.

The weight of the electronic boards is applied to the model as concentrated masses on the front and back straight edges of the absorbers. The weights considered are 26 kg per inner wheel and 168 kg per outer wheel.

The values for the kaptons and electronic boards weights have been obtained from LARG-NO-006.

Table 5 is a summary of the model weights.

#### 5.6.2 Overall Deflections

The End Cap deformed shape under its own weight is plotted on Figure 13.

The weight of the components causes a small vertical sagging in the End Cap, with a maximum vertical displacement of -0.65 mm in one of the additional outer rings. Figure 14 is a color contour of vertical U\({}_{3}\) displacements.

The sligth shift of the axial position of the absorber center of gravity produces the lateral deformed shape of Figure 15 (color contour of axial U\({}_{1}\) displacements).

Finally, Figures 16 to 18 display with more detail the axial, lateral and vertical deflections of the outer front (OFRONT), outer back (OBACK),inner front \((\mathrm{IFRONT})\), inner back \((\mathrm{IBACK})\), intermediate front \((\mathrm{ITFRONT})\), and intermediate back \((\mathrm{ITBACK})\) rings, as a function of the relative distance to the top of each ring. The maximum deflection on top and bottom of these rings is -0.49 mm.

The nomenclature for the plotted curves is mantained over all the next figures of the present document.

#### 5.6.3 Absorbers Deflections

Recovering output inside a superelement (i.e. absorbers displacements and stresses) requires dedicated runs of the Abaqus program, which generate a huge amount of output results, producing files with sizes of the order of 0.5 gigabytes, which are very difficult to manage.

Therefore only for a few absorber positions full results are recovered.

The maximum vertical displacements are developed on 90\({}^{0}\) outer and inner absorbers. Their deformed shapes can be seen on Figures 19 and 20, and the vertical displacements magnitude is shown on figures 21 and 22, being the maximum vertical deformation \((\mathrm{U_{3}})\) -1.64 mm and -1.59 mm for the 90\({}^{0}\) outer and inner absorbers, respectively.

#### 5.6.4 Support Structure Beams. Section Forces and Moments

Beam section normal and shear forces, as well as bending moments and torsional torques are evaluated in all rings and spacers frames.

As it will be realized on the cold temperature analysis, gravity loading produces much lower forces than thermal loading, so only normal forces are plotted.

Figures 23 to 25 represent the normal forces \((\mathrm{SF1})\) on the outer, inner and intermediate rings, on the auxiliar outer rings \((\mathrm{A1FRONT}\), \(\mathrm{A1BACK}\), \(\mathrm{A2FRONT}\), \(\mathrm{A2BACK})\), and on the outer spacers frame \((\mathrm{SP2}\) to \(\mathrm{SP8})_{|}\) respectively.

#### 5.6.5 Absorber Longitudinal and Transversal Bars. Section Forces and Moments

Results are recovered on 90\({}^{0}\) inner and outer absorbers. Figures 26 and 27 display normal forces on longitudinal outer front \((\mathrm{LBF}\_0\_90)\) and back (LBB_O_90), longitudinal inner front (LBF_I_90) and back (LBB_I_90), and on transversal outer (TBB_O_90) and inner (TBB_I_90) bars.

#### 5.6.6 Absorber layers stresses

The absorber layer stresses are far from the stress limit (yield stress) of the materials.

The maximum peak stresses on the stainless steel layers are developed at the joint of the absorber to the rings and they are less than 70 MPa. On the lead layer the stresses are less than 2 MPa.

### Thermo-mechanical Analysis

#### 5.7.1 Loading : Gravity + Thrust + Thermal Loads at Cold Temperature

The final operating conditions of the End Cap on the calorimeter induce three kind of loads which shall be withstood by the structure:

1. Gravity load coming from the self weight of the End Cap.
2. Thermal load produced by the temperature decrement developed on the calorimeter, from room temperature to the final liquid argon temperature = -186\({}^{0}\) C = 87 K.
3. Archimedes thrust applied on the structure because it is immersed on liquid argon in the cryostat. As this load acts in the opposite direction to the gravity load, it is simulated by withdrawing liquid argon density from the density of each End Cap component. The original and reduced densities are included on Table 6, considering a liquid argon density of 1.3\(\times\)10\({}^{-6}\) kg/mm\({}^{3}\).

The mechanical properties of the materials are those defined on paragraph 2.2.

#### 5.7.2 Overall Deflections

An isometric view of the deformed shape is plotted on Figure 28. The thermal contraction is predominant over the gravity loading, as it can be seen on Figure 29, which represent the deformed shape of the rings along with a color contour of the vertical displacements. The deflected shape is almost circular (thermal contraction is axisymmetric), and the gravity load is the responsible of the small differences between top and bottom displacements which slightly ovalizes the rings. The maximum vertical deflection (U\({}_{3}\)), located on top of the outer rings, is -7.15 mm.

Figure 30 shows a lateral view of the deflected rings, with a color contour of the axial displacements. As it was mentioned on paragraph 4.2, the shell absorbers modelization do not reflect precisely their deformation perpendicular to the waves (U\({}_{1}\) in global model), so the overall axial contraction will be better simulated with the combined shell-solid modelization, but as it was mentioned before, these will mainly affect to the spacers strenght, not to the rings.

Figures 31 to 33 are XY plots detailing the displacements (U\({}_{1}\), U\({}_{2}\), U\({}_{3}\)) of all the rings as a function of the relative distance to the top of each ring.

#### 5.7.3 Absorbers deformation

For the present combined load case, as the deflection is almost axisymmetric, only 90\({}^{0}\) outer and inner absorbers displacements have been requested (Figures 34 and 35 ). The magnitude of the lateral (U\({}_{2}\)) and vertical (U\({}_{3}\)) deformation of the 90\({}^{0}\) outer absorber is shown on Figures 36 and 37.

It has been also calculated the displacements on two consecutive outer absorbers at 90\({}^{0}\) an 90.46875\({}^{0}\), in order to know the gap variation under the operational cold conditions.

Figure 38 defines the vertical deflection (U3) of a line parallel to the waves located at the center of the outer absorbers, for both consecutive absorbers at 90\({}^{0}\) (OUTL_90) and at 90.46875\({}^{0}\) (OUTL_90+). It can be seen that the maximum _relative_ deflection is 0.06 mm.

Figure 39 represents the same comparation but for a line perpendicular to the waves located at the center of the outer absorber. The maximum _relative_ deflection is 0.04 mm.

It shall be considered that the End Cap model do not include the honeycomb spacers between the absorbers which will reduce these _relative_ deformations.

#### 5.7.4 Support structure beams. Section Forces and Moments

As the thermal expansion coefficient of the absorbers (sandwich + long./trans. bars) on radial direction is smaller than the rings coefficient, the rings tend to contract more than the absorbers, so they compress the absorbers, developing tension normal forces on the outer rings and compression normal forces on the inner rings.

Figures 40 to 45 are a compilation of all kind of section forces and moments acting on the front and back principal rings (outer, intermediate and inner ones), as the normal section force (SF1), shear section forces (SF2, SF3), bending moments (SM1, SM2) and torsional moment (SM3).

The highest normal forces are developed on the outer back ring, where SF1=77290 N, producing a normal stress \(\sigma\)=11 MPa. The discontinuity of the normal forces on the outer rings which can be seen on Figure 40, is produced because of the supporting points of the End Cap, which are located at the beam axis, exactly at the mid point between the top and the bottom of the rings.

The highest bending moment takes place also in the outer back ring (SM2=-1.242E6), producing a bending stress \(\sigma\)=9 MPa.

Figures 46 to 51, and 52 to 57 represent all kind of section forces for the additional outer rings and for the spacers, respectively.

All the stresses calculated from the section forces and moments described above are well below the yield stress of the Aluminium (\(\sigma_{\boldsymbol{vp}}\)=470 MPa. Alumold manufacturer information), or Vectra B230 for the intermediate front ring (\(\sigma_{\boldsymbol{vp}}\)=195 MPa. Vectra manufacturer information)

#### 5.7.5 Absorber Longitudinal and Transversal Bars. Section Forces and Moments

Results for 90\({}^{0}\) outer and inner absorbers longitudinal bars (normal and shear section forces, bending and torsional moments) are presented in Figures 58 to 63. The maximum normal section force is SF1=-1973 N on the 90\({}^{0}\) outer absorber front longitudinal bars, which can be with stood by the glass fiber epoxi material of the bars.

Figures 64 to 69 include the same type of results for the 90\({}^{0}\) outer and inner absorbers transversal bars, for which the forces are considerably smaller..

#### 5.7.6 Absorber Sandwich Stresses

The 90\({}^{0}\) inner absorber stresses on the stainless steel layer and on the lead layer are shown on Figures 70 and 71, respectively. The maximum peak stress on the stainless steel layers is \(\sigma\)=277 Mpa on the 90\({}^{0}\) inner absorber, and on the lead layer is \(\sigma\)= 60 Mpa on both 90\({}^{0}\) inner and outer absorbers.

#### 5.7.7 Support Rails Position Comparision

The global model has been run modifying the support boundary conditions, so as to place them 500 mm below the beam axis, as they were on a previous cryostat design.

The stresses developed on the structure are very similar to the ones reported in the preceding paragraphs, but the deflection changes considerably, as it can be realized comparing Figure 72 (top/bottom outer front ring vertical deflection U\({}_{3}\) = -8.916mm / +4.753 mm) with Figure 29 (top/bottom outer front ring vertical deflection U\({}_{3}\) = -7.156 mm / +6.426 mm).

When the support is _off_ the beam axis (Figure 72), the displacements at top and bottom positions are more different, because the position of the offset induces a lowering of the center of gravity of the End Cap.

For the front ring, the lowering of the center can be estimated as :

\(\delta_{center}\)= \(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}v_{3}^{i}}{N}\)

Being N the number of nodes in the rings and U\({}_{3}^{i}\) the vertical displacement on each node. For the outer front ring the results are as follows :

* For rails at beam axis level \(\delta_{center}\)= -0.24 mm.
* For rails 500 mm below the beam axis \(\delta_{center}\)= -1.96 mm.

In the first case, the small center drop is due to the sagging of the structure caused by its self-weight, because if only thermal load would have been applied (no gravity nor thrust), the lowering of the center would have been cero.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:22]

Conclusions

Overall stresses have been calculated on all the rings and bars, on the basis of the results presented on preceding paragraphs. Normal and shear stresses on rings, spacers and longitudinal/transversal bars have been computed as :

\(\sigma=\frac{F}{A}\pm\frac{M\times C}{I}\)

\(\tau=\frac{V}{\alpha\times A}\pm\frac{M_{t}}{Q}\)

Being F=normal section forces, A= area of cross-section, M=section bending moment, C=distance to the section neutral axis, I=section momentum of inertia, V=shear section force, \(\alpha\)=function of the cross-section, M\({}_{t}\)=section torsional torque, Q=function of the cross-section.

For the absorber layers stresses, they have been reported on previous paragraphs.

For all components, the stresses are well below the stress limit of each component material, so no global failure is expected for the arrangement analysed on the present report.

A more detailed local analysis will be still required for some special constituents as for example the intermediate front ring made possibly of composite material. A local analysis using the forces estimated on this document as input loads is being accomplished by C.P.P.M.

Moreover, a detailed structural validation of all the fastenig arrangement between the different parts (bolting, joints between 45\({}^{0}\) modules,...) shall be done when they will be finally designed.

The relative maximum discrepancy between the deformed shape of two consecutive absorbers (paragraph 5.7.3) shall be noted by physicists as this produces a variation of the gap between absorbers.

Calculated overall deflections shall be taken into account for the Integration of the End Cap on the calorimeter.

An estimation of the room temperature dimensions of the structure needed to mantain the final shape of the End Cap as close as possible to the specified cold conditions dimensions has been also presented on the reverse calculation of paragraph 6.

All the analysis done shall be revised with the finally frozen absorber accordion dimensions, and making use of the combined shell-solids absorbers
