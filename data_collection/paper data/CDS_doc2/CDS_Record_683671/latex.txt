**Abstract**

In this report the properties of the ATLAS MDTs are studied for different gas mixtures using the Garfield and Magboltz simulation programs.In particular the drift velocity and drift time of the electrons inside the tube and the \(r-t\) relation for each gas mixture are examined.An appropriate gas mixture is also proposed. A study of the stability of the operating parameters (temperature,pressure,high voltage and magnetic field) is made using the calibration of the slow control in the experimental set up in the ATLAS muon test beam area M2.

Finally,the effect of the changes of these parameters on the MDTs' function is presented for different gases.

Introduction

The basic elements used for the construction of the ATLAS muon chambers are Monitored Drift Tubes(MDTs). The cylindrical surface of the tube is the cathode and the wire placed along the axis of the tube is the anode.

When a charged particle traverses the gas of the tube,ionizes the gas atoms leaving a track along its trajectory.There are two types of ionization: primary and secondary.In primary ionization,one or two,even three electrons are ejected from the atom encountered by the fast charged particle.In secondary ionization,the electrons are ejected from atoms which are not encountered by the fast particle but by primary ionization electrons.In this type of ionization electrons are also produced through intermediate excited states of gas atoms.

Most of the charge along a track is from secondary ionization and it is not homogeneously distributed.That means that the primary and also secondary ionization electrons form clusters of one or several or many electrons.The probability distribution of the number of electrons which form the clusters is called cluster-size distribution.

Once the electrons are produced after the ionization of gas atoms,they drift towards the anode being scattered on the gas molecules so that their direction of motion is randomised in each collision.Their drift velocity has the direction which is given by the electric field \(E\) (produced by the wire inside the tube) and the magnetic field outside the tube.

The electric field \(E\) inside a cylindrical tube at a distance \(r\) from the wire is,

\[E=\frac{\lambda}{2\pi\,e_{0}r} \tag{1}\]

where \(\lambda\) is the linear charge density on the wire.

Therefore,as an electron drifts towards the wire it travels in an increasing electric field. If there is no magnetic field,the path of the electron is radial.In our case though,there is a magnetic field along the direction of the tube wire. Therefore the electrons move transversely to the magnetic field. This produces a force \(\mathbf{F}\) :

\[\mathbf{F}=m\,\frac{d\mathbf{u}}{dt}=e\mathbf{E}+e(\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{B}) -\,k\mathbf{u} \tag{2}\]

where \(m\) and \(e\) are the mass and electric charge of the electron,\(\mathbf{u}\) is its velocity vector and \(k\) describes a frictional force proportional to \(\mathbf{u}\),which is caused by the interaction of the particle with the gas. This force \(\mathbf{F}\), obliges the electrons to drift under an effective angle (Lorentz angle) with respect to the direction of the electric field.For electron drift in particle detectors we neclect the thermal motion.

As the electrons from the ionization track drift towards the wire,they ionize more gas atoms producing an avalanche on the anode (Fig. 1).

In the avalanche process there is a lateral development associated with the multiplication of charges which is due to diffusion of electrons,the electrostatic repulsion of charges and the propagation of ionizing photons.The lateral size of an avalanche depends on the gas,on the number of charges in the avalanche and their density and on the electron energy that is obtained in the various parts of the multiplication process.

It is very important to know the amplification factor(Gain) of the proportional tube.The Townsend coefficient \(\alpha\) describes the multiplication of ionization. The increase of the number of electrons per path _ds_ is:

\[dN=N\alpha ds \tag{3}\]

Integrating (3) between the point \(b\) where the field is just sufficient to start the avalanche and the wire radius \(r_{a}\),we get the Gain \(N/N_{0}\) of the proportional wire:

\[N/N_{0}=\exp\int_{b}^{r_{a}}\alpha ds=\exp\int_{E_{a}}^{E_{a}}\frac{\alpha}{dE/ ds}dE \tag{4}\]

where \(N,N_{0}\) are the final and initial number of electrons in the avalanche respectively. As the electric field in the tube is given by (1),we have,

\[N/N_{0}=\exp\int_{E_{a}}^{E_{a}}\frac{\lambda\alpha}{2\pi\,\varepsilon_{0}E^{ 2}}dE \tag{5}\]

After the collection of the avalanche's electrons on the anode,the space close to the wire is dominated by the remaining positive ions.These ions start moving towards the cathode.Their speed is relatively low.A typical value of this speed near the anode (\(E\sim 2\times 10^{5}V/cm\)) is \(10^{5}\) cm/sec and a hundred times less at hundred times the radius.The travelling time \(T\) between the wire and some point at a radius \(R\) is expressed by the mobility \(\mu\) and the electric field as a function of the radius \(R\) as,

\[T=\int_{r_{a}}^{R}\frac{dr}{\mu E(r)}=\frac{R^{2}-r_{a}^{2}}{2\mu r_{a}E(r_{a})} \tag{6}\]

where the ions are assumed to have started from the wire radius at \(t=0\).

The space charge takes hundreds of microseconds to settle on a cathode several millimeters away. The moving positively charged ions produce electrical signals that can be picked up by amplifiers connected to the electrodes.

The way of function of proportional wire tubes described so far, is the way that ATLAS MDTs will function,too. MDTs' characteristics will be constantly monitored in order to achieve the best possible resolution. This is required by the physics goals for the ATLAS muon system.

The position of each tube,it's drift velocity and it's characteristic time(\(t_{0}\)) will be constantly derived from the data(autocalibration).To this end,the precise knowledge of the temperature,pressure inside the tubes,high voltage,as well as the magnetic field are necessary.A continuous calibration of the above operating parameters will be needed in the final experimental set up.

In this report,on one hand the way these parameters are measured and monitored is studied.The experimental set up where our works took place is the one of the ATLAS M2 test beam area(Fig.2).A calibration of the test beam slow control set up was made and it is described in section 2.

On the other hand,the behaviour of the tubes for different gas mixtures is studied,using two simulation programs:Garfield and Magboltz.

The Magboltz program solves the Boltzmann transport equation under the influence of electric and magnetic fields,temperature and pressure with a numerical accuracy of 0.1% to determine e.g drift velocity,Lorentz angle and diffusion for electrons moving in gases under these conditions.

Garfield is the CERN standard drift chamber simulation program.It simulates the behaviour of drift chambers.It calculates and plots the electrostatic field,the drift lines of electrons and ions and the currents on the sense wires resulting from the passage of a charged particle through the chamber.It can also calculate \(r-t\) relations and arrival time distributions.Garfield has an interface to Magboltz.

Garfield and Magboltz predictions are presented in section 3,for the following six gas mixtures:

1. Ar: 92%,CO2:5%,CH4:3%
2. Ar: 94%,CO2:3%,CH4:3%
3. Ar: 92%,CO2:4%,CH4:4%
4. Ar: 94%,CO2:5%,C2H6:1%
5. Ar: 95%,CO2:2%,N2:2%,CH4:1%
6. Ar: 91%,CH4:4%,N2:5%

We usually address the gas Ar: 92%,CO2:5%,CH4:3% as 'first gas',the gas Ar: 94%,CO2:3%,CH4:3% as'second gas',e.t.c.

The change of the \(r-t\) relation of each of the above gases due to variations of the operating parameters,as well as the predicted error in measurement versus the distance from the wire are presented in section 4.

Finally,section 5 summarizes our results and gives the conclusion we reached.

## 2 Slow control calibration

### The hardware set up of the slow control

The temperature of the prototypes is measured by using thermistors,which as it is well known,measure resistance. To measure the pressure we use two pressure gauges,one for the flowers and the other for all the prototypes.These pressure gauges give a value of voltage. Finally,the high voltage value is given by the monitor output of H.V supply unit.

The hardware set up of the slow control is shown in table 1.

### Calibration methods

In this subsection the methods for temperature and high voltage calibration we used,are described.Slow control data examples are also presented.

#### 2.2.1 Temperature

The set up of this method is demonstrated in figure 3.

We used a pot filled with hot water,where we put a small box which supported an even smaller box on the top of it.The tips of the thermistors and a thermocouple were put in the smallest box.Water couldn't penetrate this box,so the tips were kept dry.The thermistors and the thermocouple were connected with different channels of the DVM (FLUKE).As the water was cooling down,the values of resistance and temperature were taken every 2 minutes for 3 hours.

Then we put cold water in the pot. The values were taken every 1 minute for 1,5 hours.The results we had for the two flowers,the MDT's (4 \(\times\) 4) in the magnet,the BNL,CSC and the MUNICH chambers, are shown in figure 4. In order to determine the temperature of each of these chambers,an interpolation technique is used to the calibration data.

#### 2.2.2 High Voltage

A DVM (Digital Volt Meter) was connected with the monitor output of the HV supply unit.The DVM measured the voltage in KV,while the Fluke DVM measured it in Volts. We took 4 values,fitted them and the function that derived was the following:

\[p_{1}\times\left(\text{measured value}\right)+p_{2}=\,HV\]

The constants \(p1\) and \(p2\) can be seen in table 2.

### Slow control data

Slow control data of temperature,pressure and high voltage taken from the MDT's in the magnet at the test area M2,are shown in figure 5. These are the data from a run on 24 of July 1995 that lasted for 3 hours (11.20 till 14.20). We notice that during this run the variations of pressure and high voltage are negligible. The average value of the high voltage is \(3288\pm 0kV\) and of the pressure is \(3034\pm 2mbar\). The temperature changed a little bit more than the other two parameters.It's average value is \(27.1\pm 0.6^{0}\)C. It is also obvious that it would have changed more if the run had lasted more hours.

## 3 \(r-t\) relation for the 6 gas mixtures under typical conditions

We consider the following typical values of the operating parameters:

1. Temperature:300 K
2. Pressure:2280 Torr (3 atm.)
3. Magnetic field:0.6 Tesla
4. High voltage:3300 Volts

The range of values for the reduced electric field \(E/P\) is from 0.152 V/cm Torr to 9.160 V/cm Torr. This is explained as follows.

It is already mentioned that the electric field inside the tube is given by (1). Therefore,the potential is given by the following formula,

\[V=\int_{r_{a}}^{r_{0}}\,Edr=\int_{r_{a}}^{r_{0}}\frac{\lambda dr}{2r}=\frac{ \lambda}{2}\ln\frac{r_{0}}{r_{a}} \tag{7}\]where \(r_{0}\) is the radius of the tube equal to \(1.5cm\) and \(r_{a}\) is the wire radius equal to \(0.0025cm\).

So the capacitance C is,

\[C=\lambda/V\Longrightarrow\lambda=\frac{2V}{\ln\frac{r_{a}}{r_{a}}} \tag{8}\]

Using \((1)\) and \((8)\),we have,

\[E=\frac{V}{r\ln\frac{r_{a}}{r_{a}}} \tag{9}\]

where \(V=3300\) Volts and \(r\) is the distance from the wire.

As we are interested in finding the value of the ratio \(E/P\) close to the anode (\(r=0.025cm\)) and close to the tube walls, first we replace \(r\) at \((9)\) by \(0.025cm\) and then by \(1.5cm\) and the results are:

1. \(E=20620V/cm\)
2. \(E=343.75V/cm\)

Dividing these values of \(E\) by the pressure \(P=3bar\), we get:

1. \(E/P=9.160V/cmTorr\)
2. \(E/P=0.152V/cmTorr\)

Figure 6 shows the \(r-t\) relation for our 6 gases. As we can easily see, the \(r-t\) relations for these gases are not linear. This happens because the drift velocity varies strongly with the electric field, specially at low values of the ratio \(E/P\). Drift velocity dependence on the reduced electric field for the 6 gas mixtures we studied is demonstrated in figure 7.

The non-linear drift velocity dependence on \(E/P\) can be explained by studying the drift of electrons. We consider an electron between two collisions. The electron is a light particle so it scatters isotropically. After short time it has not only an instantaneous velocity \(c\) but also an extra velocity \(u\),

\[u=\frac{eE\tau}{m} \tag{10}\]

where \(\tau\) is the average time that has elapsed since the last collision. In the next encounter,the extra energy is lost in the collision through recoil or excitation.Therefore there is a balance between the energy picked up and the collision losses.This velocity \(u\) appears macroscopically as the drift velocity. On a drift distance \(x\), the number of encounters is \(n=(x/u)(1/\tau)\). If \(\lambda\) is the average fractional energy loss per collision, the energy balance is the following:

\[\frac{x\lambda\varepsilon_{E}}{u\tau}=e\,Ex \tag{11}\]

The equilibrium energy \(\varepsilon_{E}\) carries an index \(E\) because it does not contain the part due to the thermal motion of the gas molecules, but only the part taken out of the electric field. The mean time \(\tau\) between collisions can be expressed as a function of the cross-section \(\sigma\) and the number density \(N\):

\[\frac{1}{\tau}=N\sigma c \tag{12}\]

The total energy of the drifting electron is:

\[\frac{1}{2}m\,c^{2}=\varepsilon=\varepsilon_{E}+\frac{3}{2}kT \tag{13}\]

The average fractional energy loss \(\lambda\) of the electron per collision with a gas molecule and the cross-section \(\sigma\) of the collision are both functions of the total energy \(\varepsilon\) of the drifting electron. As an illustration,the behaviour of the effective cross-sections for argon and methane,is shown in figure 8(a). A dip near \(\varepsilon\simeq 0.25\) eV or \(\varepsilon\simeq 0.30\) eV in both gases is clear. This is the famous Ramsauer minimum which is due to quantum mechanical processes in the scattering of the electron with the gas molecule.In figure 8(b) we can also see the behaviour of \(\lambda\) for argon and methane.

The dependence of \(\varepsilon\) on the electric field derives from the formulas (13),(12) and (11).Obviously the electric field depends on the drift velocity(10). So the change of \(u\) follows the non-linear variation of E according to \(\varepsilon\) change as a function of \(\lambda\) and \(\sigma\).

The threshold of excitation of the argon is at 11.5 eV, that for the methane molecule is at 0.03 eV. Therefore it is obvious why the drift velocity for electrons depends on the gas composition.Small additions of molecular gases to a noble gas change significantly the fractional energy loss as the behaviour of the energy loss in molecular gases with respect to noble gases is very different.This change of \(\lambda\) has as a result the increase of the electron drift velocity by large factors,since the fraction of drifting electrons with energy close to the Ramsauer minimum increases and the average \(\sigma\) decreases.

These molecular gases which are usually organic,are called quench gases. Quench gases having large photoabsorption coefficients, need to be present in order to absorb the photons which are produced in the avalanche.These photons must be as few as possible because if they travel further than the longitudinal size of the avalanche,then the electrons they produce will each give rise to another avalanche and the counter may break down.Sometimes these photons may reach the conducting surfaces of the cathode,where they may create free electrons by the photoelectric effect which create an avalanche.

As the quench gases reduce the average probability of a photon to ionize the gas outside the radius(r is the longitudinal size of the avalanche), they allow larger number of electrons in the avalanche and the result of this is larger Gain.

Looking now at the plots of figure 6,we realize that the \(r-t\) relation of the fifth gas (Ar:95%,CO 2:2%,N2:2%,CH4:1%) is almost linear and the minimum drift time is shorter than(at least)the first gas(Seattle gas). The explanation for this,is given by the fact that the drift velocity of the fifth gas does not vary so strongly with the reduced electric field as it does in the other five gases.

The diffusion coefficients (transverse and longitudinal) versus \(E/P\) and the Lorentz angle for the six gases we studied are given in figures 9 and 10.The four curves at each plot correspond to four different angles between the electric and the magnetic field (\(90^{0},60^{0},30^{0},0^{0}\)).The case we are interested in is the one where the angle between these two fields is equal to \(90^{0}\). The Seattle and the fourth gas have the smallest Lorentz angle(\(17.5^{0}\) for \(E/P\)=0.3 V/cm Torr). The longitudinal diffusion in all the six gases varies more abruptly than the transverse,in the range of \(E/P\) values we are interested in.

## 4 Study of the \(r-t\) relation behaviour under variations of the operating parameters

### Temperature change

After increasing the temperature from 300 K to 301 K,we calculated the \(r-t\) relation for each of the six gases we are interested in. Subtracting the new \(r-t\) relation from the one that corresponds to the typical conditions,we find the way the \(r-t\) relation shifts along the drift time axis(Fig.11). We notice that the minimum drift time of the electrons decreases at distances longer than 0.5 cm from the anode. This decrease is higher for the first gas(Seattle gas); at the distance \(r=1.5cm\) the decrease is equal to \(1.23nsec\). For closer distances from the wire (\(\sim o.5cm-0.2cm\)),the minimum drift time increases for all our gases except from the last one.

In figure 12 the expected error during measurement,versus the distance from the wire,is shown.This error is measured in \(\mu m\) and was calculated using another computer programe,which can also compute the RMS(Root Mean Square) error of the measurement. The RMS value for each gas is written in the same figure;it is obvious that it's the smallest for the fifth gas (\(1.83\mu m\)).

### Change of the magnetic field intensity

We studied the behaviour of the \(r-t\) relation for each of the six gases due to magnetic field's intensity increase equal to 1/100% of its typical value (0.6_Tesla_) used during the measurement(Fig.13).In this situation,the main characteristic is the increase of the minimum drift time(the \(r-t\) curve shifts upwards along the drift time axis).The shift is longer for the Seattle gas;at the distance \(r=1.5cm\) it is equal to \(1.6\times 10^{-}3\mu m\),whereas for the fifth gas it is equal to \(0.88\times 10^{-}3\mu m\). The expected error in measurement versus the distance from the anode,as well as the RMS error are presented in figure 14.

### Pressure change

If the pressure inside the tube is raised by 10 Torr,so it becomes 2290 Torr, the gases' \(r-t\) relation, shifts,in general,upwards(Fig.15).That means that the minimum drift time of the electrons increases. The shift for the fifth gas is again the smallest; for \(r=1.5cm\),it is equal to 0.23_nsec._Figure 16 shows, the measurement error versus the distance \(r\) and the RMS error.

### High Voltage change

We calculated the \(r-t\) relation and the way it changes due to high voltage variation equal to 10 Volts.So the high voltage value is now 3310 Volts and the results are shown in figures 17 and 18.In this case,the RMS error for the Seattle gas is \(10.18\mu m\),almost the double of that for the fifth gas(\(5.89\mu m\)).

The values of the RMS error,for the six gas mixtures and for each change of the operating parameters, are accumulated in tables 3,4,5 and 6.

### Changing the intensity of the magnetic field for the Seattle gas:Ar:92%, CO2:5%,CH4:3%

As the gas which was used in the MDT prototypes in our test beam is Ar:92%,CO2:5% CH4:3%, the so called Seattle gas,and data were taken for different values of the magnetic field,we calculated the \(r-t\) relation for this gas for four values of the magnetic field:0.5,0.6,0.7 and finally 0.8 Tesla.

So the results from Magboltz and Garfield simulations for the above magnetic field values are demonstrated in figures 19 and 20. The typical value we use for the magnetic field is,as it has already been mentioned,0.6 Tesla.When we have a field equal to 0.5Tesla,the minimum drift time of the electrons towards the anode is slightly decreased;the \(r-t\) relation curve shifts downwards.For example, at the distance \(r=1.5cm\) from the anode,the shift is about \(11nsec\). If the field value is 0.7 Tesla,the shift of the curve has the opposite direction. The minimum drift time now increases.The more intense the magnetic field is, the longer the shift is.

Figure 21 shows the almost linear way the Lorentz angle increases with the increase of the magnetic field.In this plot we use the Lorentz angle values,which correspond to \(E/P=0.3V/cmTorr\). Finally,figure 22 presents how the RMS error also increases with the increase of the magnetic field.

## 5 Conclusion

After studying the six gas mixtures,which are presented in this report,we reached the conclusion that the fifth gas(that is: Ar:95%,CO2:2%,N2:2%,CH4:1%) can be considered to be a good candidate gas mixture for the MDTs.

First of all,its \(r-t\) relation is linear.It has high drift velocity with maximum drift time equal to \(450nsec\), whereas the Seattle gas' maximum drift time is \(525nsec\). The Lorentz angle \(L_{A}\) is relatively good for the proposed gas (for \(E/P=1V/cmTorr,L_{A}=8^{0}\)). It's diffusion (longitudinal and transverse),is high. Finally the measurement error is much smaller than that of the Seattle gas. The comparison between the proposed and the Seattle gas is presented in table 3.

Although the fifth gas,due to its stable behaviour during variations of the operating parameters,can be regarded as a good candidate gas for the ATLAS MDTs,more studies need to be done in order to determine the optimum gas for ATLAS muon chambers.The optimum gas should not only be stable during the variations referred in this report but it should also be suitable to provide the required Gain(\(2-4\times 10^{4}\)),have low diffusion and small Lorentz angle and prevent, as much as possible,the chamber from ageing.
