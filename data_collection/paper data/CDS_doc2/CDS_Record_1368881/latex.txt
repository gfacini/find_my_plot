**Jet Shapes in ATLAS and Monte Carlo modeling**

ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

In this note we present results on the comparison between the measured jet shapes in inclusive jet production published by ATLAS with a variety of Monte Carlo predictions. The event generators include leading-order and next-to-leading order matrix elements, different implementations and models for parton showers, fragmentation into hadrons, and underlying event contributions, and several tuned sets of parameters aimed at describing the data. The comparisons in this note confirm the sensitivity and the potential of the jet shape measurements to constrain and partially determine the validity of the different Monte Carlo models.

Introduction

The ATLAS experiment recently published results on differential and integrated jet shapes [1] in inclusive jet production in a wide range of jet transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and rapidity \(y\), for jets reconstructed with the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [2] with distance parameter \(R=0.6\). The measurements were carried out for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV and \(|y|<2.8\), were fully corrected for detector effects back to the particle level, and were compared to several Monte Carlo (MC) predictions. The results indicated the potential of jet shape measurements at the LHC to constrain the phenomenological models for soft gluon radiation, underlying event (UE) activity, and non-perturbative fragmentation processes in the final state. This note aims to update and complement the ATLAS publication with additional comparisons of the data in Ref. [1] with different MC programs, and predictions that include recent tuned sets of parameters to describe the ATLAS minimum bias (MB) and jet data.

## 2 Jet shape definition

The differential jet shape \(\rho(r)\) as a function of the distance \(r=\sqrt{\Delta y^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\) to the jet axis is defined as the average fraction of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) that lies inside an annulus of inner radius \(r-\Delta r/2\) and outer radius \(r+\Delta r/2\) around the jet axis:

\[\rho(r)=\frac{1}{\Delta r}\frac{1}{N_{\mathrm{jet}}}\sum_{ \mathrm{jets}}\frac{p_{T}(r-\Delta r/2,r+\Delta r/2)}{p_{T}(0,R)},\ \Delta r/2\leq r\leq R-\Delta r/2, \tag{1}\]

where \(p_{T}(r_{1},r_{2})\) denotes the summed \(p_{T}\) of the clusters in the annulus between radius \(r_{1}\) and \(r_{2}\), \(N_{\mathrm{jet}}\) is the number of jets, and \(R=0.6\) and \(\Delta r=0.1\) are used. The points from the differential jet shape at different \(r\) values are correlated since, by definition, \(\sum_{0}^{R}\rho(r)\)\(\Delta r=1\). Alternatively, the integrated jet shape \(\Psi(r)\) is defined as the average fraction of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) that lies inside a cone of radius \(r\) concentric with the jet cone:

\[\Psi(r)=\frac{1}{N_{\mathrm{jet}}}\sum_{\mathrm{jets}}\frac{p_{T }(0,r)}{p_{T}(0,R)},\ 0\leq r\leq R, \tag{2}\]

where, by definition, \(\Psi(r=R)=1\), and the points at different \(r\) values are correlated.

## 3 Monte Carlo samples

The MC generators considered in this note are listed below.

* The PYTHIA 6.4.23 generator [3] is used to produce QCD-jet inclusive samples with both AMBT1 [4] and AUET2 [5] tunes, as determined by ATLAS, and with the Perugia2011 tune [6]. PYTHIA-AMBT1 is based on MRST LO* [7] parton density functions (PDFs) inside the proton, and uses as input results from the ATLAS charged particle MB analysis at \(\sqrt{s}=0.9\) TeV and \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. PYTHIA-AUET2 is based on MRST LO** PDFs [8], uses also as input ATLAS UE data [9], and includes a modified final-state parton shower from initial-state radiated partons to describe the CDF [10] and ATLAS jet shape measurements. The PYTHIA-Perugia2011 tune uses CTEQ5L PDFs [11] and constitutes an updated version of the PYTHIA-Perugia2010 tune, as inspired by the comparison with early LHC data. Samples are also generated using the PYTHIA 8.145 program [12] which, among other updates, includes a fully interleaved \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-ordered evolution for initial- and final-state gluon radiation and multiple parton interactions (MPI). The Pythia 8 samples are produced with the 4C tune [12] for the UE modeling, based on CTEQ6L1 PDFs [13] and using Tevatron and ATLAS data as input.

* QCD-jet inclusive samples are generated with the Herwig\(++\) 2.4.2 and Herwig\(++\) 2.5.1 programs [14]. The Herwig\(++\) 2.4.2 predictions used in [1] suffered from a wrong setting in the ATLAS generation of the MC samples, related to the parameters that control the contribution from MPI, which _a priori_ would affect the comparison with the data at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). In this note, the Herwig\(++\) 2.4.2 predictions, as presented in [1] (here denoted as Herwig\(++\) 2.4.2 bug), are compared with correctly generated HERWIG 2.4.2 predictions. Herwig\(++\) 2.5.1 includes a modified algorithm for color reconnection between clusters before hadronization and new color connections between soft scatters and the beam remnants that improve the description of the MB data and UE-related observables at the LHC. In the case of Herwig\(++\) 2.4.2 the LO\({}^{*}\) tune [15] is employed, while the UE7 tune [16] is used for Herwig\(++\)2.5.1 predictions. In addition, samples are produced with HERWIG 6.510 [17] interfaced with JIMMY 4.31 [18] to model the UE contributions with both AUET1-LO\({}^{*}\)[19] and AUET2-LO\({}^{**}\)[5] tunes, as determined by ATLAS using data at 0.9 TeV and 7 TeV.
* QCD-jet events are generated using the ALPGEN 2.13 program [20] interfaced with PYTHIA 6.423 for the parton shower and fragmentation into hadrons. The samples are produced with CTEQ6L1 PDFs and the Perugia6 [6] tune to model the UE contributions.
* The Sherpa 1.2.3 and Sherpa 1.3.0 programs [21] are used to generate QCD-jet samples. Default settings include CTEQ66 PDFs and MPI tuned to Tevatron and ATLAS data. The Sherpa 1.3.0 version contains a modified parton shower evolution via pre-factors within \(\alpha_{s}(p_{\mathrm{T}})\), as motivated by next-to-leading-logarithm (NLL) perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations, that improve the description of the measured Z boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) in ATLAS. Samples with different matrix element multiplicities are produced, with the aim to illustrate the impact of higher-order contributions to the description of the jet shapes. Samples with only \(2\to 2\) hard processes and with up to \(2\to 6\) partons in the final state are considered, and interfaced with parton showers.
* QCD-jet samples are generated with the POWHEG-BOX r302 program [22], which includes next-to-leading order (NLO) pQCD predictions for inclusive jet production, interfaced either with PYTHIA 6.423 or with HERWIG 6.510 plus JIMMY 4.31 for parton shower, fragmentation into hadrons, and to model the underlying event. For the latter, the AMBT1 or AUET1-LO\({}^{*}\) tunes are used, respectively.

The simulated event samples were produced using the ATLAS interface to the generators and the Rivet system [23] was used to analyse the samples and produce the relevant jet shape observables.

## 4 Results

Different observables in data are compared to the MC predictions. This includes the measured differential jet shape \(\rho(r)\) for jets with \(|y|<2.8\) in eight \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bins within the range \(30<p_{\mathrm{T}}<310\) GeV, and the integrated jet shape \(1-\Psi(0.3)\) as a function of \(|y|\) in different \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) regions and as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) in different \(|y|\) bins.

### Comparison with PYTHIA

The measured jet shapes are compared to the different PYTHIA predictions in Figs. 1 to 5. As expected, PYTHIA6-AMBT1 tends to produce jets slightly narrower than the data as it underestimates the UE activity in dijet events [5] and lacks a tuned final-state parton shower from the initial-state radiation. PYTHIA6-AUET2, PYTHIA6-Perugia2011, and Pythia 8-4C provide a good description of the measured jet shapes in the whole jet kinematic range considered 1).

Footnote 1): The reader should note that the ATLAS jet shapes measurements are input to the PYTHIA6-AUET2 tune.

### Comparison with Herwig++ and HERWIG/JIMMY

The measurements are compared to the predictions from Herwig++ 2.4.2, Herwig++ 2.5.1, and HERWIG/JIMMY programs in Fig. 6 to Fig. 10. As shown in the Figures, the effect of the wrong setting in Herwig++ 2.4.2 bug (see Section 2) is only visible for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<40\) GeV. Herwig++ 2.4.2 provides a reasonable description of the data in the whole jet kinematic range considered. HERWIG/JIMMY, which includes the AUET2 tune, describes the data best. Finally, Herwig++ 2.5.1 tends to produce jets narrower than the data.

### Comparison with ALPGEN and Sherpa

The data are compared to the predictions from Sherpa 1.2.3 (\(2\to 2\) process), Sherpa 1.2.3 (up to \(2\to 6\) process), Sherpa 1.3.0 (\(2\to 2\) process), and ALPGEN interfaced with PYTHIA in Fig. 11 to Fig. 15. Comparisons with ALPGEN interfaced with HERWIG and JIMMY were presented in [1]. The different Sherpa predictions are similar and provide a reasonable description of the data. This indicates that the presence of additional partons from higher-order matrix elements contributions do not affect the predicted jet shapes, mainly dictated by the soft radiation in the parton shower. The comparison between Sherpa 1.2.3 and Sherpa 1.3.0 shows that the NLL-inspired corrections included in the latter for the parton shower do not impact significantly the predicted jet shapes. ALPGEN interfaced with PYTHIA predicts too-narrow jets and does not describe the data. This was already the case for ALPGEN interfaced with HERWIG and JIMMY [1] and requires further investigation to determine whether the disagreement observed with the data can be completely attributed to the UE modeling in the MC samples or it is also related to the prescription followed by ALPGEN in merging the partons from the matrix elements with the parton showers in the final state.

### Comparison with POWHEG

The impact of the presence of higher-order matrix elements contributions on the predicted jet shapes is further studied in Figs. 16 to Fig. 20, where the data are compared to the predictions from POWHEG interfaced with PYTHIA or HERWIG/JIMMY, as well as to standalone PYTHIA and HERWIG/JIMMY predictions. For these comparisons, AMBT1 and AUET1-LO\({}^{*}\) tuned sets of parameters are used for PYTHIA and HERWIG/JIMMY, respectively. In general, the jet shapes predicted by POWHEG follow the trend of the corresponding standalone predictions. POWHEG interfaced with HERWIG/JIMMY provides a reasonable description of the data while the interface with PYTHIA predicts too-narrow jets. This confirms that the shape of the jet is mainly dictated by the parton shower implementation and the details of the UE modeling in the final state.

### \(\chi^{2}\) statistical tests

Finally, and following the work in [1], a \(\chi^{2}\) test is performed to the data points in Figs. 5, 10, 15, and 20 with respect to a given MC prediction, separately in each rapidity region. The systematic uncertainties are considered independent and fully correlated across \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bins, and the test is carried out according to the formula \[\chi^{2}=\sum_{j=1}^{p_{\rm T}\ {\rm bins}}\frac{[d_{j}-mc_{j}(\vec{s})]^{2}}{[ \delta d_{j}]^{2}+[\delta mc_{j}(\vec{s})]^{2}}+\sum_{i=1}^{5}[s_{i}]^{2}\, \tag{3}\]

where \(d_{j}\) is the measured data point in bin \(j\), \(mc_{j}(\vec{s})\) is the corresponding MC prediction, and \(\vec{s}\) denotes the vector of standard deviations, \(s_{i}\), for the different independent sources of systematic uncertainty. For each rapidity region considered, the sums above run over the total number of data points in \(p_{\rm T}\) and five independent sources of systematic uncertainty, and the \(\chi^{2}\) is minimized with respect to \(\vec{s}\). Correlations among systematic uncertainties are taken into account in \(mc_{j}(\vec{s})\). The \(\chi^{2}\) results for the different MC predictions are collected in Table 1.

## 5 Summary and conclusions

As a summary, Fig. 21 shows the measured \(1-\Psi(r=0.3)\) as a function of \(p_{\rm T}\) for jets with \(|y|<2.8\) and \(30\ {\rm GeV}<p_{\rm T}<600\) GeV compared to the different MC predictions considered in this note. In conclusion, we have presented comparisons between the measured jet shapes in inclusive jet production and different Monte Carlo predictions in a wide range of jet transverse momentum and rapidity. The results indicate that the predicted jet shapes are mainly dictated by the details on the implementation of the parton showers and the modeling of the underlying event in the Monte Carlo generators. The presence of contributions from higher-order pQCD matrix elements in the final state should not affect the predicted jet shapes significantly. The PYTHIA, Herwig\(++\), and HERWIG/JIMMY Monte Carlo generators, using the latest tunes to describe the minimum bias and underlying-event-related observables in data, provide a good description of the measured jet shapes, although the lastest version of Herwig\(++\) tends to produce jets narrower than the data. Sherpa provides a good description of the data while ALPGEN interfaced with PYTHIA does not describe the data. Finally, POWHEG interfaced with HERWIG/JIMMY provides a reasonable description of the data while the interface with PYTHIA predicts too-narrow jets, which is mainly attributed to the details of the underlying event modeling in the final state. These results confirm the sensitivity and the potential of the jet shape measurements to constrain and partially determine the validity of the different Monte Carlo models.
