**Comparisons of the measured inclusive jet cross section to a selection of NLO QCD predictions, and a study of the parton content of the calculations**

ATLAS Collaboration

Additional comparisons of the recently measured inclusive jet cross section data with NLO QCD calculations are presented. The theory calculations use various modern proton parton density functions and their uncertainties. The fractional contributions of the various initial state parton level configurations are also shown.

Introduction

Inclusive jet cross section measurements as a function of jet transverse momentum (\(p_{\rm T}\)) have been presented in [1]. These results are based on the full data sample collected with the ATLAS detector during 2010, which corresponds to \(37.3\pm 1.2\) pb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity. Jets have been reconstructed with the anti-k\({}_{\rm t}\) algorithm using two values of the clustering parameter (\(R=0.4\) and \(R=0.6\)). These measurements have been corrected for detector effects to the particle level such that they can be compared to any theoretical predictions whose results are particle level jets.

The experimental uncertainties achieved in some regions of phase space are similar in size to the theoretical uncertainties, thereby providing some sensitivity to different theoretical predictions.

In Section 2 we show the ratio between the data and the fixed order NLO pQCD predictions calculated with NLOJET++[2] corrected for non-perturbative effects and convoluted with various modern PDF sets. We show the theoretical predictions obtained using the CT10 [3],MSTW 2008 [4], NNPDF 2.0 (100) [5], NNPDF 2.1 (100) [6, 7], HERAPDF 1.0 [8], HERAPDF 1.5 (preliminary) [9] and GJR08 [10, 11] parton distribution function (PDF) sets divided by the predictions obtained with the CTEQ 6.6 PDF set [12] as a reference. The theoretical uncertainty shown includes scale uncertainty, PDF uncertainty, uncertainty due to \(\alpha_{s}\) and non-perturbative effects uncertainty for all PDF sets, except GJR08 and HERAPDF 1.5 (preliminary), where the uncertainty due to the strong coupling is not evaluated. The uncertainty due to \(\alpha_{s}\) is expected to be less than 5% for GJR08 and HERAPDF 1.5 (preliminary), since it is \(\sim 4-5\%\) almost independent of jet \(p_{\rm T}\) for other PDF sets.

Overall, the agreement of the NLO perturbative QCD predictions with the measurements extends over several orders of magnitude, although a general trend is observed for the theory curves to predict a larger cross sections at high jet transverse momenta. These measurements probe and may constrain the largely unexplored area of parton distribution functions at large \(x\) and high momentum transfer. The results reported here offer one of the most comprehensive tests of QCD ever performed.

Predictions using CT10 are lower compared to CTEQ 6.6 at high \(p_{T}\) in the central rapidity range and larger in forward bins. The uncertainties of CT10 predictions are much larger at high \(p_{T}\) compared to CTEQ 6.6. Predictions using NNPDF 2.0 (100) and NNPDF 2.1 (100) show almost the same behavior across all rapidity bins; also the PDF uncertainty is slightly larger for the NNPDF 2.1 (100) at large transverse momentum. Predictions using HERAPDF 1.5 follow the data most closely. Within experimental and theoretical uncertainties predictions based on all PDF sets are consistent with the data.

In Section 3 the fractional contributions of gluon-gluon, quark-gluon and quark-quark initial state parton level configurations (subprocesses) to the inclusive double-differential jet cross section have been shown as a function of jet \(p_{T}\). All the calculations were done with NLOJET++ using the CTEQ 6.6 PDF set.

The following observations are made:

* In the central rapidity region up to \(|y|<2.1\) the gluon-gluon scattering contributes about 60% at low jet \(p_{T}\), but this contribution decreases to \(\sim 5\%\) for jets with \(p_{T}>1.5\) TeV. The quark-gluon scattering is of the order of 35% at low jet \(p_{T}\), it reaches a maximum of nearly 50% at \(p_{T}\sim 400\)-500 GeVand it slightly decreases to 30% at very high transverse momentum. The contribution from the quark-quark subprocesses is very small at low jet \(p_{T}\), but is dominant ( \(\sim 60\%\) ) at high \(p_{T}\).
* In more forward rapidity regions \(2.1<|y|<2.8\) the quark-gluon scattering starts to dominate. It grows from 40 to 60% vs jet \(p_{T}\), while quark-quark scattering slowly grows from 5% at very low \(p_{T}\) to 45% at very high transverse momentum.
* In the very forward region \(3.6<|y|<4.4\) the quark-quark contribution is nearly flat and amounts to 15%, while the gluon induced processes contribute almost 85% to the cross section.

## 2 Comparison of measured data against the theory predictions calculated with different PDF sets

Figure 1: Inclusive jet double-differential cross section as a function of jet \(p_{\rm T}\) in the \(|y|<0.3\) rapidity region for jets identified using the anti-k\({}_{\rm t}\) algorithm with \(R=0.4\) (top) and \(R=0.6\) (bottom). Using as a reference the theoretical predictions calculated with CTEQ 6.6 [12], we plot the ratio of data (black dots) and the predictions calculated with CT10 [3], MSTW 2008 [4], NNPDF 2.0 (100) [5] and NNPDF 2.1 (100) [6, 7] (left); HERAPDF 1.0 [8], HERAPDF 1.5 (preliminary) [9] and GJR08 [10, 11] (right). The error bars indicate the statistical uncertainty on the measurement, and the dark-shaded band indicates the quadratic sum of the experimental systematic uncertainties, dominated by the jet energy scale uncertainty. The 3.4% uncertainty on data due to the luminosity, flat across the \(p_{\rm T}\)range, is not shown. The theory uncertainty of each PDF is given by the quadratic sum of uncertainties from the choice of renormalisation and factorisation scales, parton distribution functions, \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) and the modeling of non-perturbative effects (the uncertainty due to \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) is not evaluated for GJR08 and HERAPDF 1.5 (preliminary)).
