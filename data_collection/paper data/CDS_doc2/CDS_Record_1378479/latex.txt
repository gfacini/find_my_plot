**Comparison of \(D^{(*)}\) meson production cross sections with FONLL and GM-VFNS predictions**

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

The differential cross sections for \(D^{*\pm}\) and \(D^{\pm}\) production, measured with the ATLAS detector in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=7\,\)TeV using an integrated luminosity of \(1.1\,\)nb\({}^{-1}\), have been compared with the FONLL and GM-VFNS calculations. The NLO QCD predictions are consistent with the data in the visible kinematic range of transverse momentum \(p_{\rm T}(D^{(*)})>3.5\) GeV and pseudorapidity \(|\eta(D^{(*)})|<2.1\) within the large theoretical uncertainties.

Introduction

Measurements of heavy-quark production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) provide a means to test perturbative QCD calculations at the highest available collision energies and to experimentally constrain the heavy-quark production cross sections. The latter is important for searches for new physics phenomena at LHC, for which heavy-quark production is often an important background process.

Charmed mesons are produced in the hadronisation of charm and bottom quarks, which are copiously produced in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=7\,\)TeV at LHC. Due to the clean \(D^{(*)}\) meson signatures, measurement of charmed meson production is already feasible with the first LHC data. A measurement of the \(D^{*\pm}\), \(D^{\pm}\) and \(D_{s}^{\pm}\) production cross sections with the ATLAS detector [1] was presented earlier [2]. In this note, a comparison of the measured \(D^{*\pm}\) and \(D^{\pm}\) differential cross sections with new next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD predictions is presented.

## 2 NLO QCD calculations

The measured \(D^{*\pm}\) and \(D^{\pm}\) differential cross sections were compared in [2] with the NLO QCD calculations matched with a leading-logarithmic parton-shower MC simulation. The predictions were obtained using the codes MC@NLO 3.42 [3] and POWHEG-hvq 1.01 [4]. The MC@NLO 3.42 is matched with the HERWIG 6.5 [5] MC event generator while POWHEG-hvq 1.01 can be used with both HERWIG 6.5 and PYTHIA 6.4 [6].

In this note, the measured differential cross sections are compared with the fixed-order next-to-leading-logarithm (FONLL) [7] and general-mass variable-flavor-number scheme (GM-VFNS) [8] calculations. These calculations are not available as public codes and the predictions have been obtained from their authors by request [9]. The main differences between the FONLL and GM-VFNS calculations originate from differences between the so-called massive and massless schemes. In the massive scheme, the heavy quark \(Q\) appears only in the final state and the power terms of \(m_{Q}^{2}/p_{T,Q}^{2}\) of the perturbative series are correctly accounted for, where \(p_{T,Q}\) is the transverse momentum of the \(Q\) quark and \(m_{Q}\) is its pole mass. The massive calculations are not reliable for \(p_{T,Q}\gg m_{Q}\) due to neglected terms of the type \(\ln(p_{T,Q}^{2}/m_{Q}^{2})\). In the massless scheme, the \(Q\) quark occurs as an incoming parton and the large logarithmic terms are absorbed into the \(Q\) quark contribution to the proton parton density functions (PDF) and into the fragmentation functions of the \(Q\) quark transition to a hadron. The massless calculations are reliable only for \(p_{T,Q}\gg m_{Q}\) due to the assumption that \(m_{Q}=0\). To obtain reliable predictions for \(p_{T,Q}\approx m_{Q}\), the FONLL and GM-VFNS calculations were developed. In FONLL, the massive and massless predictions are matched exactly up to \(\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{s}^{3})\), and spurious higher order terms with potential unphysical behaviour are damped using a weight function. The FONLL parton cross sections are convoluted with non-perturbative fragmentation functions. GM-VFNS combines the massless predictions with the massive \(m_{Q}^{2}/p_{T,Q}^{2}\) power terms and derives subtraction terms by comparing the massive and massless cross sections in the limit \(m_{Q}\to 0\). The large logarithmic terms in GM-VFNS remain absorbed in the PDF and perturbatively-evolved fragmentation functions with a non-perturbative input.

The FONLL and GM-VFNS predictions were obtained using the CTEQ6.6 [10] parametrisation for the proton PDF. The value of the QCD coupling constant was \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})=0.118\) in accord with the central CTEQ6.6 analysis. The charm quark pole mass was set to \(1.5\,\)GeV in both predictions. The bottom quark pole mass was set to \(4.75\,\)GeV and \(4.5\,\)GeV in the FONLL and GM-VFNS predictions, respectively. The renormalisation and factorisation scales were set to \(\mu_{r}=\mu_{f}=\mu\), where \(\mu\) was defined as

\[\mu^{2}=m_{Q}^{2}+p_{T,Q}^{2}\.\]

The specific FONLL fragmentation functions [11] as well as the GM-VFNS fragmentation functions [12] were obtained using \(e^{+}e^{-}\) data. Fragmentation fractions of heavy quarks hadronising as a particular charmed meson, \(f(Q\to D^{(*)})\), were set to experimental values summarised in Table 1 of [2] for FONLL. In the case of GM-VFNS, the fragmentation fractions were obtained during the specific fit [12] to \(e^{+}e^{-}\) data.

Both charm and beauty contributions to the charmed meson production cross sections were included in the FONLL predictions. The following sources of theoretical uncertainties were considered for FONLL:

* scale uncertainty. The uncertainty was determined by varying \(\mu_{r}\) and \(\mu_{f}\) independently to \(\mu/2\) and \(2\mu\), with the additional constraint \(1/2<\mu_{r}/\mu_{f}<2\), and selecting the largest positive and negative variations;
* \(m_{Q}\) uncertainty. The uncertainty was determined by varying the charm and bottom quark masses independently by \(0.2\,\)GeV and \(0.25\,\)GeV, respectively. The total \(m_{Q}\) uncertainty was obtained by adding the positive and negative cross-section variations in quadrature;
* PDF uncertainty. The uncertainty was determined by using the CTEQ6.6 PDF error eigenvectors. The total PDF uncertainty was obtained by adding the positive and negative cross-section variations in quadrature.

The hadronisation uncertainties were considered negligible in comparison with other theoretical uncertainties.

In the case of GM-VFNS, only the charm contribution to the charmed meson production cross sections was calculated, thus there is a missing contribution of \(\sim 10\%\) due to the beauty hadron decays (see Table 2 in [2]). Only the scale uncertainty, which is dominating, was calculated for GM-VFNS varying three scale parameters: renormalisation scale, factorisation scale for initial-state singularities and factorisation scale for final-state singularities. The three scales were varied independently to \(\mu/2\) and \(2\mu\), with the additional constraint for ratios of any two scales to be between \(1/2\) and \(2\), and the largest positive and negative variations were selected.

## 3 Comparison of \(D^{(*)}\) Production Cross Sections with theoretical predictions

The visible \(D^{(*)}\) production cross sections were calculated for the process \(pp\to D^{(*)}X\) in the kinematic region \(p_{\rm T}(D^{(*)})>3.5\) GeV and \(|\eta(D^{(*)})|<2.1\). Contributions from both charm hadronisation and beauty hadron decays have been included in the measured visible \(D^{(*)}\) production cross sections.

The differential cross sections \(d\sigma/dp_{\rm T}\) and \(d\sigma/d|\eta|\) were calculated for \(D^{*\pm}\) and \(D^{\pm}\) production in five bins in \(p_{\rm T}\)\((3.5-5;\ 5-6.5;\ 6.5-8;\ 8-12;\ 12-40\,\)GeV) and five bins in \(|\eta|\)\((0-0.2;\ 0.2-0.5;\ 0.5-0.8;\ 0.8-1.3;\ 1.3-2.1)\). To obtain the differential cross sections in a given bin, the visible cross section in the bin was divided by the bin size.

The differential cross sections \(d\sigma/dp_{\rm T}\) and \(d\sigma/d|\eta|\) for \(D^{*\pm}\) and \(D^{\pm}\) production are compared in Figs. 1-4 with the NLO QCD predictions. The data points are drawn at the bin centres of gravity in the \(d\sigma/dp_{\rm T}\) distributions and at the bin centres in the \(d\sigma/d|\eta|\) distributions. The bin centre of gravity is defined as the point at which a value of the exponential function, describing the distribution slope, equals the mean value of the function in the bin. The GM-VFNS predictions were obtained using rapidity instead of the pseudo-rapidity variable due to technical restrictions; this produces a marginal effect on the predicted cross sections.

The central FONLL predictions are below the data although the predictions exceed the central MC@NLO and POWHEG predictions by \(\sim 30\%\) on average. The central GM-VFNS predictions are slightly above the data. Both FONLL and GM-VFNS calculations are consistent with the data in the measured \(p_{\rm T}(D^{(*)})\) and \(|\eta(D^{(*)})|\) ranges within the large theoretical uncertainties.

## 4 Summary

The differential cross sections \(d\sigma/dp_{T}\) and \(d\sigma/d|\eta|\), measured for \(D^{*\pm}\) and \(D^{\pm}\) production in the kinematic region \(p_{T}(D^{(*)})>3.5\) GeV and \(|\eta(D^{(*)})|<2.1\) with the ATLAS detector in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV, have been compared with the FONLL and GM-VFNS calculations. The NLO QCD predictions are consistent with the data within the range of large theoretical uncertainties.
