In this note we re-assess the sensitivity of the ATLAS detector to Vector Boson Fusion Higgs production in the decay channel \(H\to WW\to l\nu l\nu\) using improved Monte Carlo for the dominant background. We shed some light on the effects of this new description of the background by comparing a set of cuts optimized on the new Monte Carlo to a similar set of cuts optimized on the Monte Carlo used in previous studies. We also assess the sensitivity of the existing Neural Network analysis to the change in the description of the dominant background and compare the sensitivity of the Neural Network analysis to the optimized cut analysis. We show that this channel is an important channel at intermediate masses (\(200\mathrm{GeV}<\mathrm{M_{H}}<500\mathrm{GeV}\)); previous analyses of the discovery potential of this channel only considered Higgs masses up to \(200\mathrm{~{}GeV}\).

Introduction

The search for the Higgs boson [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] is one of the most interesting and pressing questions in particle physics today, and Higgs production via Vector Boson Fusion(VBF) is one of the most promising channels for detecting the Higgs boson at the LHC[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. In this note, we revise and improve the analysis of VBF \(H\to WW\to l\nu l\nu\). In Section 2, we review the physics processes and state the Monte Carlo generators used to model them. After a brief outline of our approach in Section 3, we list our preselection cuts in Section 4. In Section 5, we describe the technique we use to optimize our cuts and compare the cuts that result from optimizing on the old Monte Carlo to the cuts that result from optimizing on the new Monte Carlo. In Section 6, we discuss the use of Neural Networks to separate signal from background. In Section 7, we present the results of the event selections based on Classical cuts and Neural Networks; we also present the sensitivity of the ATLAS detector to this channel and discuss the relative merits of the various approaches. Lastly, in Section 8, we summarize our conclusions.

## 2 Physics Processes

Vector Boson Fusion is a quark scattering process mediated by vector boson exchange wherein the vector boson radiates a Higgs; Figure 1 shows a typical Feynman diagram. In this note, we are concerned with events in which the Higgs decays into two \(W\) bosons, both of which decay leptonically. The final state associated with such events includes the two quark jets from the hard scattering in conjunction with two leptons and missing \(P_{T}\) from the decays of the \(W\) bosons. The dominant backgrounds for this process are \(t\bar{t}\) production where the \(W\) bosons from the top decays decay leptonically, and Electroweak \(W\) pair production. For low values of the Higgs mass, backgrounds coming from \(Z\) production are also quite important.

To be more precise, in this analysis, we consider the following processes:

* VBF \(H\to WW^{(*)}\), the signal we are trying to detect. For this process, we use the generator provided in PYTHIA6.1[14]. For historical reasons, we neglect the contribution to this process from events where either \(W\) decays into a \(\tau\) lepton and a \(\tau\) neutrino.
* \(t\overline{t}\) production, the dominant background for most values of the Higgs mass we consider. A pair of top quarks is produced; both decay to a \(W\) boson and a b-jet; we are interested in events where the \(W\) bosons decay leptonically. In previous studies [11], the PYTHIA generator was used; in this study we compare results obtained using this generator with results obtained using the generator provided in the MC@NLO package [15, 16].1 An important caveat here is that spin correlations in the decay products of the top quarks are neglected both of these generators. It is also worth noting that the cross-sections predicted by these two generators are different by almost 40%. Footnote 1: We note that while the Pythia-based cut analysis uses a sample of \(t\overline{t}\) events that does contain the contribution from \(W\to\tau\nu_{\tau}\), the Pythia-based neural network analysis uses a sample of \(t\overline{t}\) events which does not. All results based on MC@NLO \(t\overline{t}\) events do include this contribution to the \(t\overline{t}\) background.
* Electroweak \(WWjj\) production, a quark scattering process mediated by a vector boson, wherein two \(W\) bosons are produced and decay leptonically. Although the cross-section is small compared to the other backgrounds, this process is actually the second-dominant background for most masses because it is so similar to the signal. To model this process, we use a matrix element [17, 9] that has been interfaced to Pythia [18].2 Footnote 2: For historical reasons, our Monte Carlo sample for this background does not include the contribution from \(W\to\tau\nu_{\tau}\).
* QCD \(WWjj\) production. The total cross-section for this process is significantly larger than the cross-section for Electroweak \(WWjj\) production, but this process turns out to be less important because of the jet configurations that tend to be produced. For this process, we use the generator provided in PYTHIA.3 Footnote 3: Ibid.
* Electroweak \(Zjj\) production. A \(Z\) boson is produced in a weak boson mediated quark scattering process and decays into \(\tau\) leptons which in turn decay leptonically.

cally. This process was modelled using a leading-order matrix element interfaced to PYTHIA [19].
* QCD \(Zjj\) production. For this process, we use a leading-order matrix element from the MadCUP [20] project. As before, we consider events where the \(Z\) decays into taus and the taus decay leptonically. Parton showering and hadronization are treated with Herwig [21].
* \(Zj\) production where the \(Z\) decays to a muon pair or an electron pair. This background can be reduced substantially by requiring a minimum missing \(P_{T}\). However, it cannot be ignored because of its large inclusive cross-section. We model this process with PYTHIA.

To model the detector response, we use ATLFAST and apply the ATLFAST-B energy corrections. [22]

## 3 Strategy

Our approach in this study is to treat the classical cut based analysis on the same footing as the Neural Network based analysis to the greatest extent possible. In practice, after applying a set of preselection cuts, we choose seven variables that can be used to further discriminate signal from background. Then, we train a Neural Network and (in parallel) optimize a set of cuts on those seven variables; this approach allows us to perform a direct comparison of the results and make a meaningful statement about the advantages and disadvantages of multivariate approaches like Neural Networks with respect to traditional cut techniques.

## 4 Preselection Cuts

Before attempting to optimize any cuts, we first apply the following (rather loose) preselection cuts:

* Require that the event have 2 leptons
* b-jet veto: Reject the event if there are any b-tagged jets with \[|\eta|<2.5\text{ and }P_{T}>20\text{GeV}.\] (1) We assume a b-jet tagging efficiency \(\epsilon_{b}=60\%\).
* Require that the event pass either the single- or double-lepton trigger at ATLAS. This means that there must be either a single electron with \(P_{T}>25\text{GeV}\), a single muon with \(P_{T}>20\text{GeV}\), or two leptons such that any electrons have \(P_{T}>15\text{GeV}\) and any muons have \(P_{T}>10\text{GeV}\).

* Forward Jet Tagging Cuts: Choose the two highest \(P_{T}\) jets in the event as the two 'tagging' jets. Reject the event if they are in the same hemisphere, i.e. \(\eta_{1}\eta_{2}>0\). Require that they both have \(P_{T}>20\)GeV and that they are separated by at least three units of rapidity: \(\Delta\eta_{jj}>3.0\).
* Require that both leptons be between the two tagging jets.
* Real \(\tau\) rejection: Reject the event if \(x_{\tau}^{1}>0\), \(x_{\tau}^{2}>0\), and \(|M_{\tau\tau}-M_{Z}|<2\)5GeV.4 Footnote 4: In studies where real \(\tau\) leptons are required to be present in the final state, it is conventional to put an upper bound on \(x_{\tau}^{1}\) and \(x_{\tau}^{2}\), since the interpretation of \(x_{\tau}\) as the fraction of the \(\tau\) energy carried by the visible decay products ceases to make sense if \(x_{\tau}\) is greater than 1. In this study, we apply no such upper bound; \(M_{\tau\tau}\) does not need to have a strict interpretation as the invariant mass of two \(\tau\) leptons in order to be a useful tool for background suppression.
* Invariant mass of the tagging jets: \(M_{jj}<6000\)GeV. This cut is intended to prevent outliers from interfering with the cut optimization and the neural net training.
* Central Jet Veto: Reject the event if any jets with \(P_{T}>20\)GeV other than the two tag jets are present in the region \(|\eta|<3.2\).
* \(M_{T(ll\nu\nu)}\): Require that the event has \(M_{T(ll\nu\nu)}>30\)GeV.
* Transverse Mass: Require that 50GeV \(<M_{T}<2\,M_{H}\).
* Drell-Yan rejection: If the leptons are the same flavor, reject the event if \[85\mbox{GeV}<M_{ll}<95\mbox{GeV}\mbox{ or }P_{T}^{\rm miss}<30\mbox{GeV}\] (2)

We apply a lepton identification efficiency of 90% for each lepton and corrections to account for full-simulation effects in the forward jet tagging and fake veto cuts. [23]

We use the following variables as Neural Network inputs (and in the cut analysis, we apply the cuts listed along with the variables):

* \(\Delta\eta_{jj}\), the rapidity separation of the two tagging jets. For the cut analysis, we require that \[\Delta\eta_{jj}>\Delta\eta_{jj}^{min}\] (3)
* \(\Delta\,\phi_{jj}\), the azimuthal separation between the two tagging jets. We do not apply any cuts to this variable for the cut optimization; however, we do use it as a Neural Net input.
* \(M_{jj}\), the invariant mass of the two tagging jets. In the cut analysis, \[M_{jj}^{min}<M_{jj}<M_{jj}^{max}\] (4)* \(\Delta\eta_{ll}\), the rapidity separation between the two leptons. Here, we apply a maximum cut, \[\Delta\eta_{ll}<\Delta\eta_{ll}^{max}\] (5)
* \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\), the phi separation between the two leptons. In the broad mass range we consider, both upper and lower bounds are important here: \[\Delta\phi_{ll}^{min}<\Delta\phi_{ll}<\Delta\phi_{ll}^{max}\] (6)
* \(M_{ll}\), the invariant mass of the two leptons. We place both a maximum and a minimum cut, so that \[M_{ll}^{min}<M_{ll}<M_{ll}^{max}\] (7)
* \(M_{T}\), the transverse mass. We consider events that fall within the mass window \[M_{T}^{min}<M_{T}<M_{T}^{max}\] (8)

The variables we use are defined as in previous studies of this channel. [11, 13, 24] Specific values of the cuts we apply (e.g. \(\Delta\eta_{jj}^{min}\)) are given in the following sections. To reduce the time required to train Neural Nets and perform cut optimizations, we take the natural logarithm of \(M_{ll}\) and \(M_{jj}\). Plots of these variables for the \(e-\mu\) channel are shown for a representative Higgs masses of 120 GeV in Figure 2; similar distributions for several other masses and channels are shown in the plots in Appendix A along with tables showing the cross-sections after preselection for all the masses we consider.

## 5 Cut Optimization

### Genetic Algorithms

For this analysis, we have performed a mass-dependent cut optimization; that is, we have optimized the cuts for each of a series of masses and parameterized the resulting cuts as a function of the Higgs mass. To facilitate the optimizations, we have used a genetic algorithm to optimize the cuts. The basic procedure for implementing a genetic algorithm is straightforward:

* define a 'genome' that incorporates all the information you want to optimize,
* define a function that determines the 'fitness' of a given genome,
* define an operator that can cause a given genome to'mutate', and
* define an operator that can create a new genome out of two genomes ('crossover').

Once these things have been defined, the optimization is performed by:Figure 2: The distributions of the seven variables discussed in Section 4 for a Higgs mass of 120 GeV in the \(e-\mu\) channel.

* creating a 'population' of genomes (randomly generated for the first iteration, created based on the previous iteration's population for subsequent iterations)
* evaluating the fitness function for each genome, and
* creating a new population using the mutation and crossover operators.

This process is repeated until the user is satisfied with the results; for our study, this means about 1500 generations. Once this is done, we select the individual with the highest fitness to be the'result' of the optimization.

There is a large variety of software that implements genetic algorithms available on the internet; we use a library that is available from MIT [25]. For this study, we used a one-dimensional binary string genome defined by the GABin2DecGenome class in GAlib. For each cut to be optimized (e.g. \(M_{jj}^{max}\)), we provide a range of possible values; the range is split into \(2^{16}\) equal pieces, such that a block of 16 bits in the binary string genome specifies the value of the cut that the genome in question applies. All genomes contain the same number of 16-bit blocks (one for each cut to be optimized), and all the blocks are arranged in the same order within the genomes. We use the GA1DBinaryStringGenome::UniformCrossover operator to perform crossover operations; this essentially says that when a new genome is created from two parents, any given bit is equally likely to come from either parent. We use a crossover probability of 60% and a mutation probability of 10%. We evaluate the fitness of each genome by reading out the values of the cuts given by each of its 16-bit blocks and applying those cuts to a training dataset consisting of 100,000 events, where the number of events from a given subprocess is determined by the cross-section of that subprocess.5 We set the fitness of the genome to \(e^{s/\sqrt{b}}\) where \(s\) is the number of signal events expected to pass that genome's cuts at a luminosity of \(10fb^{-1}\), and \(b\) is the number of background events expected to pass at the same luminosity.6 When performing an optimization, we use a population consisting of 1500 individuals.

Footnote 5: Each individual classifies all 100,000 events, so the fittest individual at the end of training is very likely to be the best-optimized set of cuts considered.

Footnote 6: In early attempts to perform this optimization, we used the gaussian significance, \(s/\sqrt{b}\). The decision to exponentiate was made in order to increase the selection pressure and hasten training time.

It is worthwhile to point out that this process does not always return a perfectly optimized set of cuts. A number of factors can contribute to such errors, for example:

* If the dimensionality of the problem is high (i.e. there are many cuts to be optimized), the algorithm may have some difficulty rigorously exploring the phase space. (It may also be difficult to populate the space with training points if this is the case, so one should avoid trying to concurrently optimize too many cuts.)
* If there exist a very large number of local maxima, it is possible that the algorithm will not find the true global maximum in the time allotted.

* If the fitness function is slowly varying in region of the maximum, then selection pressure will not drive the algorithm to converge on any particular point.
* If two cuts are highly correlated to each other, then the maximum will be slowly varying in one cut or the other and the algorithm may not return a consistent, repeatable value for either one or both of the correlated cuts.

In spite of these shortcomings, we have decided to use the genetic algorithm approach to optimize cuts because of its superior ability to avoid local minima and because many of these concerns are present in other approaches to cut optimization as well. To wit, we feel that it can be rather difficult to do a really good job optimizing cuts with the gradient descent approach used in traditional optimization programs like MINUIT. Nevertheless, it is often the case that the fittest individual in the population at the end of the training period is far from the true global maximum of the fitness function. It is partially for this reason that we optimize cuts independently for each mass and each channel; the redundancy inherent in this approach can provide condsiderable insight as to whether or not any given population of genomes has truly found the global maximum.

### Optimization on PYTHIA

We first optimize a set of cuts using Pythia to model the \(t\overline{t}\) background. Plots showing the results of this optimization can be found in Appendix B. The black curves in these plots show the parameterization that we use on our analysis; they are given by the following expressions:

* \(\Delta\eta^{min}_{jj}\): we fit the optimized cut values to the functional form \[\frac{a}{(M_{H}-b)}+cM_{H}+d\] (9) We use the values \(a=14.077\), \(b=93.75\,34\), \(c=0.0031494\), and \(d=2.7415\) for our parameterization. The raw results of the optimization as well as our parameterization are plotted in Figure 22.
* \(M_{jj}\): we see no meaningful dependence of this cut on the Higgs mass. We use the values \(M^{min}_{jj}=551.776\,GeV\) and \(M^{max}_{jj}=2\,928.5\,GeV\). The raw results of the optimization as well as this parameterization are plotted in Figure 23.
* \(\Delta\eta^{max}_{ll}\): For Higgs masses greater than or equal to \(200\,GeV\), we fit \(\Delta\eta^{max}_{ll}\) to a parabola: \[p_{0}+p_{1}M_{H}+p_{2}M^{2}_{H}\] (10) We use the values \(p_{0}=4.75279\), \(p_{1}=-1.25219\times 10^{-2}\), and \(p_{2}=1.32113\times 10^{-5}\). The raw results of the optimization and this parameterization are plotted together in Figure 24* \(\Delta\,\phi_{ll}\): When we perform the cut optimization, we allow both a maximum and a minimum cut on this variable; however, it turns out that only one of the limits is important for any given Higgs mass. In the low mass region(\(M_{H}<200GeV\)), the lepton angular distributions are dominated by spin correlations, so that the leptons tend to emerge close together (as can be seen in Figure 2, the distribution peaks at around \(\frac{\pi}{6}\)). Hence, only the maximum cut is applied; we parameterize this cut as: \[p_{0}+p_{1}M_{H}+p_{2}M_{H}^{2}+p_{3}M_{H}^{3}\] (11) where \(p_{0}=-53.6643\), \(p_{1}=1.13491\), \(p_{2}=-7.63494\times 10^{-3}\), and \(p_{3}=1.69004\times 10^{-5}\). At higher masses, well above the WW threshold, the Higgs gives the outgoing leptons enough of a boost that they tend to emerge more back-to-back; in this region, only the minimum cut plays a role. We parameterize the minimum cut as a straight line: \[p_{0}+p_{1}M_{H}\] (12) where \(p_{0}=-1.92851\) and \(p_{1}=7.58351\times 10^{-3}\). We note that it was not necessary to put this division of the phase space in by hand; rather, it emerges from the results of the optimization (as can be seen from Figure 25).
* \(M_{ll}\): We parameterize the upper bound on this variable as \[\frac{a(M_{H}-b)^{2}}{d-(M_{H}-b)^{2}}+c\] (13) where \(a=310.117\), \(b=113.614\), \(c=47.6477\), and \(d=13288.1\). For higher masses, the lower bound becomes important as well; we parameterize this as a parabola: \[a(M_{H}-b)^{2}+c\] with \(a=-2.81569\times 10^{-3}\), \(b=463.813\), and \(c=129.342\). The raw results of the optimization and our parameterization are shown in Figure 26.
* \(M_{T}\): We parameterize the lower bound on \(M_{T}\) as a line: \[p_{0}+p_{1}M_{H}\] (15) where \(p_{0}=79.9148\) and \(p_{1}=0.955\). The upper bound is parameterized as a cubic polynomial \[p_{0}+p_{1}M_{H}+p_{2}M_{H}^{2}+p_{3}M_{H}^{3}\] (16) where \(p_{0}=127.816\), \(p_{1}=-1.34355\), \(p_{2}=0.0129464\), and \(p_{3}=-1.60131\times 10^{-5}\). The raw results of the optimization as well as the parameterization are shown in Figure 27.

As can be seen from the figures in Appendix B, these parameterizations adequately reflect the behavior of the optimized values. We postpone a discussion of the efficiency of these cuts until section 7.

### Optimization on MC@NLO

To rigorously assess the stability of the analysis against changes in the monte carlo description of the \(t\overline{t}\) background, we independently reoptimize the same cuts on the same variables, this time using MC@NLO to model the \(t\overline{t}\) background. As before, plots showing the results of this optimization can be found in Appendix B. The red curves (and the one blue curve) in these plots correspond to the values we use in the analysis and are given by the parameterizations below:

* \(\Delta\eta_{jj}\): We use the same functional form as for the optimization on Pythia; this time the parameters are: \(a=2860.94,\ b=-326.765,\ c=9.63\times 10^{-3},\) and \(d=-3.44\).
* \(M_{jj}\): Again, we use the same cut for all Higgs masses; \(519.346<M_{jj}<3325.08\).
* \(\Delta\eta_{ll}\): For \(M_{H}\geq 25\,0GeV,\) we parameterize \(\Delta\eta_{ll}^{max}\) as a straight line: \[p_{0}+p_{1}M_{H}\] (17) where \(p_{0}=3.87993\) and \(p_{1}=-4.16896\times 10^{-3}\). For the new dataset, the optimal value of this cut converged sufficiently well for low Higgs masses that we could apply a meaningful parameterization; for \(M_{H}\leq 200GeV\) we parameterize \(\Delta\eta_{ll}^{max}\) as \[p_{0}+p_{1}M_{H}+p_{2}M_{H}^{2}\] (18) where \(p_{0}=6.24822,\ p_{1}=-6.23858\times 10^{-2},\) and \(p_{2}=1.99032\times 10^{-4}\). This corresponds to the blue curve in figure 30.
* \(\Delta\,\phi_{ll}\): Using the same functional forms that we used for these cuts on the Pythia dataset, we find \(p_{0}=-2.20328\) and \(p_{1}=7.5381\times 10^{-3}\) for \(\Delta\phi_{ll}^{min}\); and \(p_{0}=-4.06999,\ p_{1}=0.156559,\ p_{2}=-1.3095\,6\times 10^{-3},\) and \(p_{3}=3.42011\times 10^{-6}\) for \(\Delta\,\phi_{ll}^{max}\).
* \(M_{ll}\): We feel that the parameterization based on Pythia adequately describes the features of the optimization based on MC@NLO.
* \(M_{T}\): Using the same functional forms that we used for these cuts on the Pythia dataset, we find \(p_{0}=-17.003\) and \(p_{1}=0.726924\) for \(M_{T}^{min}\); and \(p_{0}=105.801,\)\(p_{1}=-0.825469,\ p_{2}=9.46408\times 10^{-3},\) and \(p_{3}=-9.49303\times 10^{-6}\) for \(M_{T}^{max}\).

We note that most of these parameterizations closely resemble their counterparts in the previous section; we take this to mean that our analysis is not terribly sensitive to higher-order corrections like the ones taken into account by MC@NLO. As before, we postpone a discussion of the efficiency of these cuts until Section 7.

Neural Networks

We have also performed a Neural Network analysis of this channel. To facilitate more direct comparison between the Neural Network analysis and the classical cut analysis, we use the same preselection cuts as for the cut analysis. Furthermore, we use as Neural Network inputs the 6 variables used in the cut analysis plus \(\Delta\phi_{jj}\), the \(\phi\) separation between the two jets. It is clear by inspection that there is very little advantage to placing a cut on this variable; we therefore feel that its presence as a Neural Network input does not put a bias on our conclusions about the relative power of the Neural Network and classical cut analyses.

For all masses and all channels (_ee_, \(e\mu\), and \(\mu\mu\)), we use a 7-10-10-1 Neural Network structure; that is, we use two hidden layers with 10 nodes each. We train each Neural Network on a dataset consisting of 250,000 events, half signal and half background. The background events consist of \(t\overline{t}\) and Electroweak WW backgrounds weighted by cross-section7; other backgrounds are ignored during training. We test the neural nets on an independent Monte Carlo sample (which includes all backgrounds mentioned in Section 2, of course). Representative distributions of the Neural Network output are shown in Figure 3 and in Appendix D. We note that we have only performed the Neural Network training on a Monte Carlo dataset where the \(t\overline{t}\) background was modelled with Pythia; however, we have tested these networks on MC@NLO as well. The results of this study are contained in Section 7.

Footnote 7: By “weighted by cross-section,” we mean that the number of events of either subprocess is determined by the cross-section of that process; the events themselves are unweighted.

## 7 Results

In this section, we present the results of each of the analyses described above. We also perform several comparisons and discuss the stability of our analysis against radiative corrections. For the cut flow tables, we apply the cuts parameterized above in the following order:

* Topology cuts: Require that there be at least two leptons, and that there be either 0, 1, or 2 muons for the _ee_, \(e\mu\), and \(\mu\mu\) channels respectively. Apply the lepton id efficiency factor of 0.9 for each lepton. The two leptons are required to pass either the single- or double-lepton trigger; this requirement was discussed in more detail in Section 4. We also apply the b-jet veto at this level.
* Forward Jet Tagging: Require that the two highest \(P_{T}\) jets in the event be in opposite hemispheres, with at least \(\Delta\eta_{jj}^{min}\) units of pseudorapidity between them. The leptons are required to be between the tagjets in pseudorapidity. Efficiency corrections for the forward jet tagging are applied at this level.

* Real Tau Rejection: This cut was discussed in Section 4.
* \(M_{jj}\): The value of the jet-jet invariant mass is required to lie in the region \(M_{jj}^{min}<M_{jj}<M_{jj}^{max}\), where \(M_{jj}^{min}\) and \(M_{jj}^{max}\) are given by the parameterizations in Section 5.2.
* Central Jet Veto: This cut was discussed in Section 4. An efficiency correction is applied in order to model fake vetos due to pile-up events.
* Lepton Angular Cuts: At this level, we require \(\Delta\,\phi_{ll}^{min}<\Delta\,\phi_{ll}<\Delta\phi_{ll}^{max}\) and \(M_{ll}^{min}<M_{ll}<M_{ll}^{max}\).
* Transverse Mass Cuts: For this cut, we require that \(M_{T(ll\nu)}>30GeV\) and \(M_{T}^{min}<M_{T}<M_{T}^{max}\).

We note that the numbers contained in the cut flow tables do not include the preselection cuts. That is, now that the genetic algorithm has been run and the results have been parameterized, we return to the original dataset (before preselection) and apply the optimized cuts in sequence. Consequently, the numbers at the beginning of the cut flow tables are typically larger than the cross-sections after the preselection cuts have been applied.

### Pythia Cuts on Pythia

In this section, we take the parameterized cuts optimized on Pythia (i.e. the cuts presented in Section 5.2) and apply them to a Monte Carlo dataset where the \(t\overline{t}\) background is modelled with Pythia. Table 2 and Tables 12 and 13 in Appendix C show the cross-sections for signal and the various backgrounds for the masses we consider after all cuts have been applied. Table 1 and Tables 14, 15, and 16 show the cut flows in the \(e-\mu\) channel for Higgs masses of 120 GeV, 160 GeV, 300 GeV, and 500 GeV respectively. Figures 4, 34, and 35 show the distributions of relevant variables after successive cuts. Figure 5 and Table 17 show the expected Poisson significance after \(10fb^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity, assuming a 10% systematic error on all backgrounds. 8

Footnote 8: We calculate significance using the approach outlined in [26, 27] and we assume that the systematic uncertainties on the various backgrounds are all uncorrelated.

At this point, it makes sense to compare our current results to the existing analysis of this channel; however, a rigorous comparison is difficult because of a number of differences between this analysis and the analysis of [12]. Most importantly:

* As pointed out in Section 2, our monte carlo for a number of physics processes, including signal, do not include the contribution from \(W\to\tau\nu\).
* We ignore the contribution from events where a Higgs is produced via gluon-gluon fusion.
* Our cuts on the tag jet \(P_{T}\), the rapidity gap between the tag jets, and several other variables are slightly looser than the cuts used in [12].
* While we do apply a scale factor of 1.2 to the \(t\overline{t}\) background to model the contribution from the single-top background, an additional scale factor of 2.1 was applied in [12] to approximate the results of a tree-level matrix element calculation. Because we intend to make comparisons with the one-loop calculation of the \(t\overline{t}\) background in MC@NLO, we ignore this factor here.

It is, however, worth noting that in spite of these differences, the significances we find here are not radically different from those given in [12]; our significances based on Pythia (in Table 17) agree with the previous values at the level of 5-10% or better.

In this section, we take the same cuts from the previous section (i.e. the cuts presented in Section 5.2) and apply them to a dataset that uses MC@NLO to model the \(t\overline{t}\) background. Table 3 and Tables 18 and 19 in Appendix C show the cross-sections after all cuts for signal and all backgrounds for the values of the Higgs mass we consider. Tables 4, 20, 21, and 22 show the cut flows in the \(e-\mu\) channel for Higgs masses of 120 GeV, 160 GeV, 300 GeV, and 500 GeV respectively. Figure 8 and Table 23 show the expected Poisson significance after \(10fb^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity, assuming a 10% systematic error on all backgrounds. Figure 9 shows the percent degradation in expected significance that results from switching from Pythia to MC@NLO for the description of the \(t\overline{t}\) background. At low masses, where this channel is most important, the significance is almost unaffected by the change in the background description, but at high masses, the drop is as large as 20%. Inspection of the \(t\overline{t}\) cross-section reveals that although the predictions from Pythia and MC@NLO are almost the same at low masses, they are different by a factor close to 2 at high masses. The reason for this is the difference in the transverse mass distribution given by the two generators. Figure 6 shows this distribution for the two generators after the preselection cuts given in Section 4. The plot is normalized to cross-section; it clearly indicates that the major difference between the two generators arises at high mass. Moreover, it goes a long way

Figure 6: The transverse mass distribution for the \(t\overline{t}\) background in the \(e\mu\) channel after the preselection cuts given in Section 4, normalized to cross-section. The black curve shows the distribution given by Pythia, and the red curve shows the distribution given by MC@NLO. The fact that the difference between the two curves is only important at high masses explains the behavior of the cross-sections in the mass scan tables.

to explain the difference between the \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\) distributions between the two generators (pictured in Figure 74); events with large transverse mass tend to have leptons that are more back-to-back than events with small transverse mass. One might think that the difference in the \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\) distributions in Figure 74 is due to possible differences in the treatment of spin correlations in the different generators, but this effect appears to be rather small. Figure 7 shows the (Monte Carlo truth) \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\) distributions (before any cuts) given by the default generator in Herwig. The black curve includes spin correlations in the decays of the \(W\) bosons produced by top quark decays, while the red curve has spin correlations switched off;9 the difference between the two curves is substantially smaller than the difference between the curves in Figure 74. We thus conclude that the difference between the two curves in Figure 74 is due largely to kinematics.

### MC@NLO Cuts on MC@NLO

In this section, we take the cuts optimized on a dataset that uses MC@NLO to model the \(t\overline{t}\) background (i.e. the cuts presented in Section 5.3) and apply them to that same dataset to evaluate their efficiency. Table 5 and Tables 24 and 25 in Appendix C show the cross-sections after all cuts for all the masses and final states we consider. Tables 6, 26, 27, and 28 show the cut flows for representative Higgs masses of 120, 160,

Figure 7: The \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\) distributions predicted by the default generator in Herwig with spin correlations included (black) and ignored (red). The difference between these two curves is not large enough to explain the difference between the two curves in Figure 74; the remaining difference must therefore be due to kinematics.

## Appendix D

When performing a Neural Network analysis, it is always important to verify that the Neural Networks are behaving in ways that are understood and sensible. To this end, we plot the distributions of the neural network inputs for events that the neural networks classify as "signal-like" and "background-like." (For our purposes, "signal-like" means that the neural network output is larger that 0.875, and "background-like" means that the neural network output is smaller than 0.125.) Figures showing these distributions for Higgs masses of 120 GeV, 160 GeV, and 500 GeV are shown in Appendix D. It is clear from the figures that the Neural Networks are selecting events that, for the most part, would be accepted by the cut analysis.

We calculate significances for the Neural Network analysis by using the Neural Network output as a discriminating variable for a Likelihood Ratio treatment, as described in [27].10 The significances for the various channels, as well as the combined significances, are shown for \(10fb^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity in Table 30. For convenience, these values are plotted as a function of Higgs mass in Figure 13. In both the tables and the plots, we assume a 10% systematic uncertainty on the normalization of the backgrounds.11 We note that this plot suggests that this channel may be a discovery

Figure 12: The improvement obtained by reoptimizing the cuts specifically for MC@NLO. The lack of meaningful improvement implies that the drop in significance shown in Figure 9 is due to physics, not poor optimization.

channel for Higgs masses as high as almost 350 GeV; however, it will be shown that the more complete description of the \(t\overline{t}\) background given by MC@NLO degrades this picture somewhat.

### Pythia Neural Nets on MC@NLO

In this section, we take the same neural networks that were trained on Pythia \(t\overline{t}\) events and apply them to \(t\overline{t}\) events that were generated with MC@NLO. Figures 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, and 76 in Appendix E show the distributions of the inputs to the neural networks for the two different \(t\overline{t}\) generators; we note that the differences between Pythia and MC@NLO in most of these variables are not striking. (The difference between the \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\) distibutions was discussed in Section 7.2.) More importantly, we note that the Neural Network output for the two different \(t\overline{t}\) generators (pictured in Figures 77, 78, 79, and 80 for the \(e\mu\) channel for Higgs masses of 120,160,300, and 500 GeV respectively) has a very similar shape; this suggests that the neural networks are successfully exploiting the same physics in both \(t\overline{t}\) samples. There is, however, some enhancement of the cross-section in the signal-like region; this causes the final significances for the MC@NLO-based analysis to be somewhat smaller than the significances for the purely Pythia-based Neural Network analysis. As we did for the latter analysis, we calculate the significance by using a Likelihood Ratio on the Neural Network output; the results are shown in Table 31 and Figure 14.

Figure 13: Expected significance for \(10fb^{-1}\) using the Neural Network analysis based on Pythia. Values are calculated by using the Neural Network output as a discriminating variable for a Likelihood Ratio.

At this point, we are prepared to consider the degradation of the Neural Network analysis that results from switching from one \(t\overline{t}\) generator to another. Figure 15 shows this degradation (i.e. the percent difference between the significances plotted in Figure 14 and the significances plotted in Figure 13). We find that the Neural Network analysis suffers substantially more than the cut analysis; however, we wish to point out that in spite of this degradation, the Neural Network analysis still offers an improvement in excess of 20% over the classical cut analysis (see Figure 16).

### Further Comparisons between Pythia \(t\overline{t}\) and MC@NLO \(t\overline{t}\)

Since the \(t\overline{t}\) background is the largest background for this channel, it is worthwhile to understand the differences between the two generators we have used to model its contribution here. We note that such comparisons have already been done for more general features such as jet \(P_{T}\) in reference [28]; in this section our purpose is to extend these comparisions to features that are more specific to the analyses we have presented in the previous sections.

First, we compare the predictions of the shape of the \(t\overline{t}\) background after successive cuts in the cut analysis. (Here, we show only \(\Delta\eta_{jj}\), \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\), \(M_{ll}\), and \(M_{T}\).) Figures 81, 82, and 83 show these distributions for a Higgs mass hypothesis of 120 GeV, 160 GeV, and 500 GeV, respectively. As was the case for the distributions shown after the Neural Network preselection cuts, most of these shapes are quite similar, indicating again that our analysis is not terribly sensitive to radiative corrections to the \(t\overline{t}\) background.

Figure 14: Expected significance for \(10fb^{-1}\). Values are calculated by using a Likelihood Ratio as a discriminating variable.

Figure 16: Improvement of the significance of the Neural Network over the classical cut analysis for Neural Networks trained on Pythia and tested on two different \(t\overline{t}\) descriptions.

Figure 15: Degradation in significance (for \(10fb^{-1}\)) when the description of the \(t\overline{t}\) background switches from Pythia to MC@NLO.

One of the most important points where the predictions of Pythia and MC@NLO differ is the efficiency of the Central Jet Veto. Table 7 shows the efficiency of the Central Jet Veto cut as a function of mass for Pythia and MC@NLO for the cuts given in Section 5.2 and for MC@NLO after the cuts given in Section 5.3. The strong difference in this efficiency is a major reason why the sensitivity of the cut analysis does not change dramatically. This difference can be better understood by examining the distribution of \(\eta^{*}\), which is given by

\[\eta^{*}=\eta_{3}-\frac{(\eta_{1}+\eta_{2})}{2} \tag{19}\]

where \(\eta_{1}\) and \(\eta_{2}\) are the pseudorapidities of the two tagjets and \(\eta_{3}\) is the pseudorapidity of the leading non-tag jet. \(\eta^{*}\) is correlated to the central jet veto: events with small \(\eta^{*}\) are events that have a jet in between the two tagging jets and are thus more likely to be rejected by the central jet veto, while events with large \(\eta^{*}\) have jets that are farther from the central region and are thus more likely to pass the central jet veto. Figure 17 compares the \(\eta^{*}\) distributions of the two generators for a Higgs mass of 160 GeV. The radiative corrections in MC@NLO primarily enhance the low-\(\eta^{*}\) region; hence the central jet veto can more effectively reject the \(t\overline{t}\) background given by MC@NLO.

## 8 Conclusions

We have presented a new analysis of Higgs production via Vector Boson Fusion where the Higgs decays to W bosons and the W bosons decay leptonically. We have made use of the improved description of the dominant \(t\overline{t}\) background available in MC@NLO and we have shown that, due largely to the Forward Jet Tagging and Central Jet Veto cuts, this new description of the background does not have a large impact on the sensitivity of the cut analysis at low masses. We have extended the range of the analysis up to Higgs masses of 500 GeV; this opens up the possibility of performing coupling measurements on Higgs bosons with intermediate mass. We have implemented a Neural Network based search for the Higgs boson in this channel and shown that a 40-50% enhancement of the sensitivity is a reasonable expectation. Lastly, we have assessed the stability of the Neural Network analysis against changes in the description of the \(t\overline{t}\) background and shown that the Neural Network analysis can enhance the sensitivity by more than 20% over the classical cut analysis.

Table 7: Central Jet Veto Efficiencies for Signal, Pythia \(t\overline{t}\), and MC@NLO \(t\overline{t}\). Note that we are required to examine this efficiency as a function of mass, since our \(\Delta\eta_{jj}\) cut is a function of the Higgs mass hypothesis. For this table, we use the parameterization of \(\Delta\eta_{jj}^{min}\) given in Section 5.2. Note also that the 0.76 in the last line of the signal column is not a typo; the central jet veto efficiency does grow slightly as \(M_{H}\) is increased.

Figure 17: Comparison of distributions of \(\eta^{*}\) for the \(t\overline{t}\) background predicted by the different generators used in this study. The dashed red curve shows the result obtained by applying the cuts in Section 5.2 (up to but not including the Central Jet Veto) with the Higgs mass hypothesis set to 160 GeV to a set of \(t\overline{t}\) events generated with Pythia. The solid black line shows the result obtained by applying the same cuts to a set of \(t\overline{t}\) events generated with MC@NLO. The dotted green line shows the result obtained by applying the cuts of Section 5.3 (again, with a Higgs mass hypothesis of 160 GeV) to a set of \(t\overline{t}\) events generated with MC@NLO. These curves are normalized to cross-section. Because this distribution is more sharply peaked for MC@NLO, the central jet veto can more effectively reject the \(t\overline{t}\) background produced by that generator.
