###### Abstract

\(\mathrm{Z}\gamma\) production at the LHC provides an opportunity to probe neutral gauge boson self-interaction in a direct way. The possibility to detect anomalous \(\mathrm{Z}\gamma\mathrm{Z}\) and \(\mathrm{Z}\gamma\gamma\) couplings is investigated in the context of the ATLAS detector. The expected limits on these couplings will significantly improve the limits currently obtained by the LEP experiments.

Introduction

The self-interactions of the gauge bosons are consequences of the non-Abelian structure of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model; therefore the strength of trilinear and quartic gauge couplings is predicted as a result of the gauge symmetry of the theory. The study of trilinear gauge boson couplings in two-boson production processes is within the reach of existing accelerators and measurements of \(WWZ\) and \(WW\gamma\) are being performed with increasing precision at LEP2 [1] and at the TeVatron [2]. While non-zero values are predicted for the couplings in the triple and quartic vertices involving charged gauge bosons, the tree level vertices Z\(\gamma Z\), Z\(\gamma\gamma\), ZZ\(\gamma\) and ZZZ are not generated by the Standard Model Lagrangian; higher order corrections through virtual loops contribute at the level of \(10^{-4}\)[3]. New phenomena with characteristic mass scale above the present experimental threshold might lead to tree-level neutral gauge couplings (NTGC) in the effective Lagrangian [4, 5, 6] parameterizing the residual low energy effects from new physics. For example as suggested in [5], virtual effects from new heavy fermions having non-standard coupling to gauge boson might generate sizeable anomalous contributions. In this note, the Z\(\gamma\) production at the LHC is investigated with the simulation of the ATLAS detector, with the aim of searching for Z\(\gamma\gamma\) and Z\(\gamma\)Z anomalous couplings. Experiment al constraints on these couplings have been produced from the analysis of LEP [1] and TeVatron data [2]. The study presented here has higher sensitivity, since all the terms in Z\(\gamma V\) vertex are proportional to the momenta of the gauge bosons involved, this results in an enhancement of the sensitivity to NTGC as the center-of-mass energy increases.

The note begins with a brief summary of the neutral trilinear couplings (NTGC) and how they are parameterized. Next, a detailed analysis of the Z\(\gamma\) production and the signatures of the NTGCs at the LHC is presented. Following that, a summary of the expected limits on anomalous couplings at the LHC with the ATLAS detector will be given and compared with what will be obtained elsewhere.

## 2 Theoretical Framework

### Probing Z\(\gamma\gamma\) and Z\(\gamma Z\) vertices at the LHC

At lowest order in the SM, hadronic Z\(\gamma\) production proceeds via the Feynman graphs shown in figure 1 (t-channel graph exchange). The cross section for Z\(\gamma\) signal with \(p_{T}(\gamma)>100\,GeV\) is \(\sim 2.4\,pb\). Non standard Z\(\gamma\gamma\) and Z\(\gamma Z\) couplings contribute to Z\(\gamma\) production via a photon or Z in the s-channel as shown in figure 2.

The most general Z\(\gamma V\) vertex (where \(V\) is the intermediate virtual boson, either photon or Z ) compatible with Lorentz invariance and electro-magnetic gauge invariance involves four independent operators, corresponding to the allowed helicity states for the Z\(\gamma\) pair [6]. Indeed, the massless photon of the final state can have only two helicities \(-1\) or \(+1\). The massive Z boson can have in addition helicity 0, which restricts the possible number of different helicity amplitudes for the right side of the diagram in figure 1 to \(2\times 3=6\). However the two combination which correspond to the opposite helicities of the photon and Z in the final state are excluded because they require a total helicity of \(\pm 2\), incompatible with an s-channel exchange of a vector (spin 1) particle. Thus only four out of six possible helicity amplitudes are allowed corresponding to \((\lambda_{\gamma},\lambda_{\rm Z})=(0,+),(+,+),(0,-),(-,-)\).

The dominant NTGCs contribution to the amplitude corresponds to \((\lambda_{\rm Z},\lambda_{\gamma})=(0,\pm)\). In the case of \(h_{1}\) and \(h_{3}\) this contribution is proportional to \((\sqrt{\hat{s}})^{3}\): a factor \((\sqrt{\hat{s}})^{2}\) arise because the interactions come from dimension 6 operators, and a factor \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\) because the Z is longitudinal. In the case of \(h_{2}\) and \(h_{4}\), since the interactions come from dimension 8 operators, there is an additional factor \(\hat{s}\) and the contribution is proportional to \((\sqrt{\hat{s}})^{5}\).

In a model independent description, there exist eight couplings: four of them \((h_{i}^{Z},i=1,...,4)\) corresponding to \(V=Z\) and four \((h_{i}^{\gamma})\) corresponding to \(V=\gamma\). The vertex function was first given in [6]. In this note, the most recent convention established in [5] is adopted.

Assuming only Lorentz and \(U(1)_{em}\) gauge invariance as well as Bose statistics, the most general \({\rm Z}\gamma V\) vertex function [6] is defined in equation 1, where Z, \(\gamma\) are on-shell neutral gauge bosons, while \((V=Z,\gamma)\) is off-shell.

\[\Gamma^{\alpha\beta\mu}_{{\rm Z}\gamma V}(q_{1},q_{2},P)=\frac{i (P^{2}-M_{V}^{2})}{M_{Z}^{2}}\Big{[}h_{1}^{V}(q_{2}^{\mu}g^{\alpha\beta}-q_{2} ^{\alpha}g^{\mu\beta})+\frac{h_{2}^{V}}{M_{Z}^{2}}P^{\alpha}((P.q_{2})q^{\mu \beta}-q_{2}^{\mu}P^{\beta})\] \[-h_{3}^{V}\epsilon_{\mu\alpha\beta\rho}q_{2\rho}-\frac{h_{4}^{V} }{M_{Z}^{2}}P^{\alpha}\epsilon_{\mu}\beta\rho\sigma\,P_{\rho}q_{2\sigma}\Big{]}\]

Compared to [7], additional factor \(i\) was introduced (as noted in [5]) in order for the related effective New Physics Lagrangian to be hermitian.

The lowest dimensional operators associated to \(h_{i}^{Z,\gamma}(i=1,3)\) coupling are of dimension six, while dimension eight operators are associated to \(h_{i}^{Z,\gamma}(i=2,4)\).

The couplings \(h_{i}^{V}\) are C-odd dimensionless functions of \(q_{1}^{2},q_{2}^{2}\) and \(P^{2}\). In addition \(h_{1}^{V}\)

Figure 2: _Additional Feynman diagrams which contribute t to the tree level process \(q\vec{q}\to Z\gamma\) when nonstandard model \({\rm Z}\gamma\gamma\) and \({\rm Z}Z\gamma\) couplings are introduced._

Figure 1: _Feynman diagrams for the tree level contributing to \(q\vec{q}\to Z\gamma\) in the SM._

\(h_{2}^{V}\) are P-even, and thus violate CP. The other pair \(h_{3}^{V}\), \(h_{4}^{V}\) is CP-conserving. In the SM \(h_{1}^{V}=h_{2}^{V}=h_{3}^{V}=h_{4}^{V}=0\).

The coefficients in equation (1) have the following relation to physical quantities [8, 9]:

\[\mu_{Z}=\frac{-e}{\sqrt{2}m_{Z}}\frac{E_{\gamma}^{2}}{m_{Z}^{2}}(h_{1}^{Z}-h_{2 }^{Z});\ Q_{Z}^{e}=\frac{2\sqrt{10}e}{m_{Z}^{2}}h_{1}^{Z}\]

\[d_{Z}=\frac{-e}{\sqrt{2}m_{Z}}\frac{E_{\gamma}^{2}}{m_{Z}^{2}}(h_{3}^{Z}-h_{4 }^{Z});\ Q_{Z}^{m}=\frac{2\sqrt{10}e}{m_{Z}^{2}}h_{3}^{Z}\]

where \(\mu\) and \(d\) denote the magnetic and electric dipole transition moments and \(Q^{m}\), \(Q^{e}\) the corresponding quadruple moments of the Z boson. \(E_{\gamma}\) is the photon energy.

The effects of the anomalous CP-violating \(h_{1}^{Z}(h_{2}^{Z})\) are very similar to that of \(h_{3}^{Z}(h_{4}^{Z})\). The contribution of the \(h_{i}^{\gamma}\) coupling is about 20% less than the contribution of \(h_{i}^{Z}\) coupling of equal strength. This is true for all plots in this note, so this fact will not be emphasized further, and only the signature of \(h_{3}^{Z}\) and \(h_{4}^{Z}\) will be discussed.

### Unitarity Limits and Form Factors

Neutral gauge couplings in Z\(\gamma\) production arise in the J=1 partial wave amplitude only (s-channel exchange of gauge-boson coupled to massless fermions ). The anomalous contributions rise as \(\hat{s}\) increases, eventually violating unitarity. In order to cure this behavior, form factors decreasing with \(\hat{s}\) with an arbitrary scale \(\Lambda_{FF}\) are introduced. The form factor typically used is [10]:

\[h_{i}^{V}(\hat{s})=\frac{h_{i0}^{V}}{(1+\frac{\hat{s}}{\Lambda_{FF}^{2}})^{n} }\hskip 28.452756pt(i=1,2,3,4) \tag{2}\]

where \(\Lambda_{FF}\) is related to the scale of the new physics producing the anomalous Z\(ZV\) couplings. \(n\) must be greater than 3/2 for \(h_{1,3}^{V}\) and \(n>5/2\) for \(h_{2,4}^{V}\) in order to ensure unitarity of the partial wave amplitudes [11]. In the following \(n=3\) for \(h_{1,3}^{V}\) and \(n=4\) for \(h_{2,4}^{V}\) is chosen. These choices guarantee that unitarity is preserved and that terms proportional to \(h_{2,4}^{V}\) have the same high energy behavior as those proportional to \(h_{1,3}^{V}\). Selecting an exponent sufficiently above the minimum value of 3/2(5/2) ensures that the Z\(\gamma\) differential cross section stays well below the unitarity limit at energies \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\gg\Lambda_{FF}\gg M_{Z}\), where novel phenomena such as resonance production are expected to dominate (and where this parameterization is clearly not correct).

From now on in this note, \(h_{i}^{V}\) represents the bare coupling \(h_{i}^{V}\equiv h_{i0}^{V}\).

### Event Generation

The LL and NLL SM photon transverse momentum distributions for the \(pp\to Z\gamma+X\) are shown in figure 3. The NLL corrections [12, 13, 14] grow with the photon transverse momentum and with the center of mass energy. At the LHC, the QCD corrections increase the SM cross section by about a factor 2 at \(p_{T}(\gamma)=1\,TeV\) whereas the enhancements is only a factor 1.4 for \(p_{T}(\gamma)=100\,GeV\). The large QCD corrections at high values of \(p_{T}(\gamma)\) are caused by a collinear enhancement factor [17], \(\log^{2}(p_{T}(\gamma)/m_{Z})\) in the \(qg\to Z\gamma q\) partonic cross section for the photon transverse momenta much larger than \(m_{Z}\), and the large \(qg\) luminosity at LHC energies. The large corrections arise from the kinematical region where the photon is produced at large \(p_{T}\) and recoils against the quark which radiates a soft Z boson which is almost collinear to the quark, and thus is similar to the enhancement of QCD corrections observed at large vector boson transverse momenta in \(W\gamma\), \(WZ\), and \(W^{+}W^{-}\)[17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. The effect,however is less pronounced than in these processes. In the \(W\gamma\) and \(WZ\) production, the SM Born cross section is suppressed due to the appearance of an exact or approximate radiation zero [16], while there is no radiation zero in the Z\(\gamma\) case.

NLL corrections are important at high \(p_{T}(\gamma)\) (Figure 3), and alter the shape of the distribution which tends to be enhanced at high \(p_{T}(\gamma)\). Qualitatively, this is precisely what one expects from the non-standard Z\(\gamma\gamma\) and Z\(\gamma\)Z couplings and therefore the sensitivity to NTGCs will be decreased.

At NLL, a large fraction of the Z\(\gamma\) events with large photon momentum will contain a high \(p_{T}\) jet. The effects of the QCD corrections can be reduced by vetoing events with hard jets in the central rapidity region, i.e. by imposing a "Zero jet" requirement and considering Z\(\gamma+0\,jet\) production only. The NLL 0 jet and the LL differential cross section are shown in figure 3. The jet veto is effective in recovering the qualitative shape of the Born distribution.

Photons can also be significantly produced at the LHC from the bremsstrahlung [23] or fragmentation of final state parton such as \(qg\to Zq\) followed by photon bremsstrahlung from the final state parton. At the leading-logarithm level, the photon bremsstrahlung process is of the same order as the Born process and is therefore included in the LL calculations and generators described below: \(\sigma_{LL}=\sigma_{Born}+\sigma_{LLbrems\,strahlung}\). The bremsstrahlung contribution constitutes a background to the search for anomalous couplings, since it does not involve any triple gauge couplings. This process can be suppressed by requiring the photons to be isolated from the jet [23]. The cut used at the generation level [12] correspond to \(z=\frac{E_{\gamma}}{E_{parton}}>0.87\)

The NLL generator by Baur, Han, and Ohnemus [12] (BHO) for Z\(\gamma\) production includes contributions from the square of the Born graph, interferences between Born graphs and virtual one-loop diagrams, and the square of the real emissions graphs. A The NLL QCD corrections have been calculated using the narrow width approximation and ignoring spin correlation in the finite virtual corrections.

More complete calculations are available in the NLL generator by De Florian and Signer (DS) [13] which properly take into account the full spin correlation in the vector boson production and decay (including the virtual one-loop graphs). Both generators include the option of non-standard NTGC.

The gluon fusion process \(gg\to Z\gamma\) is small in the SM (\(\sim 20\%\)) [24] and is not considered in this note.

A comparison between the DS and BHO calculation at NLL at particle level generators was performed using MRST (NLO) structure functions for the factorization scale \(Q^{2}=~{}M_{Z}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}((P_{T}^{Z})^{2}+(P_{T}^{\prime})^{2})\). The chosen SM input parameters were: \(\sin^{2}\theta_{W}=0.23\)\(M_{Z}=~{}91.187\,GeV\), \(\alpha_{E\,M}(M_{Z})=~{}1/128\), the strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{S}(M_{Z})=~{}0.1175\) and the leptonic branching ratio of the Z boson \(BR(Z\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-})=3.36\%\). The results are obtained using the following cuts: a transverse momentum cut of \(P_{T}^{\ell}>25\,GeV\) for the charged leptons and the rapidity is limited to \(\left|\eta\right|<2.5\) for all particles. The photon transverse momentum cut is \(P_{T}^{\gamma}>100\,GeV\). Additionally, charged leptons and the photon must be separated in the rapidity azimuthal angle by: \(\Delta R_{\ell\gamma}=\sqrt{((\eta_{\gamma}-\eta_{\ell})^{2}+(\phi_{\gamma}- \phi_{\ell})^{2})}>0.7\). An additional cut \(M_{\gamma,tt}>100\,GeV\) is applied, which will be useful in the data analysis in order to suppress radiative Z decays.

The transverse momentum distribution of the Z boson(for the two generators), inclusive NLL and NLL with jet veto are shown in figure 3. The calculated cross sections are shown in table 1.

The two calculations agree at the level of 1% and qualitative agreement is observed in the shape of the distribution. The jet veto is efficient in recovering the qualitative shape of the LO distribution.

### Generator and Detector Simulation

The BHO Monte Carlo produce flavor and color averaged results, relative weights can be accessed for the initial state (\(q\bar{q},gq,g\bar{q}\)). A configuration is randomly chosen and passed to PYTHIA 6.1 [25] for the hadronization and the fragmentation of the partons. The output is used as an input to ATLFAST [26] for the fast detector simulation of the ATLAS experiment. A comparison between the NLL result with a jet veto at the parton level and the NLL interfaced to PYTHIA and ATLFAST using the same jet veto is shown in figure 4. A reasonable agreement is found for the shape of the \(p_{T}(\gamma)\) distribution.

## 3 Analysis

### Event Selection

In this note, a NLO study is presented. The generation and the simulation are based on the BHO NLL Monte carlo interfaced to PYTHIA 6.1 and ATLFAST for the fast detector simulation of the ATLAS experiment.

The study presented here covers the channel \(\mathrm{Z}\gamma\rightarrow\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\gamma(\ell,\ell\,=e,\mu)\). Only the electron and muon decay channels of the Z bosons are included. A similar analysis using hadronic weak boson decays would require elaborate QCD background studies.

Right: the ratio of the NLL differential cross section over the LL one._

Another mode \({\rm Z}\gamma\to\nu\bar{\nu}\gamma\) is also not included in this study despite the Z boson's large branching ratio into neutrino pair. The need to suppress strong background from dijet and direct photon production will drastically reduce the \({\rm Z}\gamma\) detection efficiency. Such analysis requires a good understanding of the missing transverse energy reconstruction.

Events are selected if they pass the ATLAS trigger selection (see reference [29],section 11). In order to study the signatures of the NTGCs, a set of basics cuts (see table 2) are imposed. The signature consist of two charged high \(p_{T}\) leptons which define the Z boson, and well isolated photon. To subtract radiative events where the photon is emitted off of a charged decay lepton, the photon is required to be well separated and to form together with the leptons a mass greater than of the decaying Z boson: the invariant \({\rm Z}\gamma\) mass must exceed \(100\,{\rm GeV}\). The photon-lepton separation defined in the rapidity azimuth space as \(\Delta R_{\ell\gamma}=\sqrt{((\eta_{\gamma}-\eta_{\ell})^{2}+(\phi_{\gamma}- \phi_{\ell})^{2})}\) must be greater than 0.7. NLO contributions are suppressed by imposing a jet veto: events where a jet of \(p_{T}^{jet}>30\,GeV\) and \(|\eta|<3\). are rejected. The efficiencies are assumed to be 80% per photon and 90% per lepton. The number of events expected for an integrated luminosity of \(100\,fb^{-1}\) is about \(2050\,{\rm events}\).

### Background to \({\rm Z}\gamma\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\gamma\)

The \({\rm Z}\gamma\) has a very small cross section, compared to \({\rm Z}+jets\) production for example, and can contain a significant amount of background. The dominant background to the \({\rm Z}\gamma\) signal is from \({\rm Z}+jets\) production where the jet is misidentified as a photon (see for instance [27]), resulting in a fake signal. Radiative \({\rm Z}\) decay also contributes when the electron from the Z radiates a photon, and both \(t\overline{t}\gamma\) and \(b\overline{b}\gamma\) can also produce a fake signal. \(W(\tau\nu_{\tau})\gamma\) also makes a small contribution to the backgrounds.

There will be a large rate of soft hadronic interaction (minimum-bias events) from the bulk of the proton-proton interactions. The pile-up of many soft interaction in the same trigger rate, due to the high luminosity adds a non negligible level of noise on top of the interesting events. This can produce fake jet veto and then reduces the signal. However, it has been shown in [28] that the effect of pile-up on the jet veto when the threshold of the \(P_{T}(jet)>30\,GeV\) and \(|\eta(jet)|<3\) is smaller than 5%.

* \(\gamma^{*}/{\rm Z}+jets\): with one of the jets faking a photon by fragmenting into high energy \(\pi^{0}\) which subsequently decays into a pair of spatially close photons unresolved in the EM calorimeter. For the \({\rm Z}(e^{+}e^{-})\gamma\) channel there is an additional background from jets faking electrons. Jets are able to fake electrons by fragmenting into a leading

\end{table}
Table 2: _Summary of the selection requirements_\(\pi^{0}\) with the track originating from photon conversion. The electron jet rejection is 10000 [29]. For the ATLAS detector, the probability of a jet faking an electron or photon has been studied in great detail in [30]. Using the \(\mathrm{Z}(e^{+}e^{-})\)_jet_ sample and multiplying the number of jet by the probability that a jet fakes a photon \(R_{jet/\gamma}=3200\) is the way of estimating the contribution of the background. A jet-electron separation \(\Delta R_{jet/e}>0.7\) is required between the jet and both of the electrons, in the same way an electron-photon separation is imposed for the signal. Multiplying the number of jets by \((R_{jet/\gamma})^{-1}\), about 330 number of events of background are obtained. A jet veto further reduces this background which will affect only marginally the sensitivity to NTGCs at high \(p_{T}(\gamma)\).
* \(t\overline{t}\), \(t\overline{t}\gamma\): with the subsequent decay of top quark into \(W\) boson and \(b\) quark, followed by each \(W\) decay into \(\ell\nu\) provide the same events signature to the \(\mathrm{Z}\gamma\rightarrow\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\gamma\). Therefore, due to the very large top production cross section, and the jets faking photons, these processes represent a significant background. The \(t\overline{t}\gamma\) events are generated using PYTHIA, first by generating \(t\overline{t}\) events and looking for events where an isolated photon is produced by initial state QED or QCD radiation. This method produces a 14 events before the jet veto cut. Since the top quark decays predominantly into \(Wb\) final state, \(t\overline{t}\) events are characterized by a large hadronic activity which frequently results in one or several high-\(p_{T}\) jets. This observation suggests that the \(t\overline{t}\) background may be suppressed by vetoing the high-\(p_{T}\) jets. The jet veto reduces significantly the \(t\overline{t}\gamma\) background as illustrated in table 5.
* \(b\overline{b}\gamma\): The number of \(b\overline{b}\) events is very large at the LHC, but the requirement of leptons well isolated from jets together with the cut on the transverse momentum of the lepton which should exceed 25 GeV suppress this background easily.
* Radiative Z: This background is generated using PYTHIA and PHOTOS [31]. The method to reduce this background is to make a cut on the invariant \(\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\gamma\) system. The \(\mathrm{Z}\gamma\) signal produces the leptons and the photon almost back-to-back. Ensuring that they are well separated using the quantity \(\Delta R_{\ell\gamma}>0.7\) will further reduce the radiative Z decay.
* \(\mathrm{Z}(\tau^{+}\tau^{-})\gamma\): Another source of background is the process \(\mathrm{Z}\gamma\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\gamma\rightarrow\ell^{+}\ell^{-} \gamma\nu_{\tau}\nu_{\tau}\nu_{t}\overline{\nu}_{t}\). Although such cascade decay events are not really background events, they are not included in the BHO Monte carlo. It is further reduced by the \(p_{T}\) cuts on the final state leptons.
* \(\gamma+jets\) and \(\mathrm{Z}b\overline{b}\): these backgrounds are easily suppressed by the kinematical cuts.

The background calculation in the muon channel is much simpler since the probability for jets to fake a pair of muons is negligible. Such fake muon in principle can occur for b-jets, but the requirements of muons well isolated from jets together with the transverse momentum cut, suppress this type of fake muon to negligible level.

Table 5 shows a list of cuts reducing the background to the \(\mathrm{Z}\gamma\rightarrow\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\gamma(\ell=e,\mu)\) signal and how each cut affects both the signal and the background. The rejection is enhanced by the jet veto, about 160 events of background are expected for an integrated luminosity

of \(100\,fb^{-1}\). The cuts lead to a small background (figure 5).

As noted in section 2.3, the bremsstrahlung contribution is reduced with the cut at the generation level asking \(z=\frac{E_{\gamma}}{E_{parton}}>0.87\). With this cut, the bremsstrahlung contribution is less than 10% of the cross section after all cuts. The rejection of the bremsstrahlung has not been studied in detail here. However, several studies have been done for the \(\gamma q\) process in the past [32] and more recently [27] with strong cuts showing that the bremsstrahlung contribution is reduced at a level similar to the Boson-jet contribution (\(\sim\) 10% of signal).

### Systematic uncertainties

The uncert ainties on the predictions mainly come from the theoretical uncertainty, the size of the generated sample, the parameterization of the cross section, the detector response and the luminosity.

The NLL cross section for Z\(\gamma\) production depends significantly on the the choice of the structure functions used and the scale \(Q^{2}\) at which they are used. Figure 6 shows the variation of the cross section for different structure functions. An error of 10% is used for the structure function uncertainty.

At the NLL level, the Q-dependence enters not only via the parton distribution functions, but also through the running coupling \(\alpha_{s}(Q^{2})\). By varying the value of \(Q^{2}\) (momentum transfer) from the \(\frac{1}{2}Q^{2}\) to \(2Q^{2}\) the cross section was observed to change by 10%.

Since about 2 500 000 events for each pair of couplings were generated, the total statistic all uncertainty for all the coupling values is less than 1%. A set of points was used to parameterize \(\sigma(h_{i}^{V},h_{j}^{V})\), the error of such parameterization was estimated by calculating the cross section for a given couple of NTGCs and then comparing these cross sections with the calculated values. The error on this parameterization is less than 1%.

The detector scale uncertainty and the resolution uncertainties are evaluated by changing the transverse momentum of the leptons at high \(p_{T}\) by 5%. A very small impact (less than 1%) on the sensitivity limit was found. The uncertainty on the luminosity was taken to be 5% [29].

Increasing or decreasing the jet transverse momentum threshold will change the size of the QCD corrections, and thus will increase the deviation of the NLL calculations from the LL result. The optimization of the jet veto threshold should take into account the fact that the pile up can fake jet veto and reduce the signal. However no systematic effect can be deduced for this effect.

In addition, the background is \(\sim 5\%\) and the uncertainty on it is \(\sim 30\%\) and will have a negligible effect on the limits.

The different sources of uncertainties are summarized in the table 4.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Source of Error & Relative uncertainty \\ \hline \hline Luminosity & 5\% \\ Statistics of MC & 1\% \\ Structure function choice & 10\% \\ Factorization and renormalization scale & 10\% \\ Parameterization of the cross section & 1\% \\ \hline \hline Total & 15\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 3.4.2 Energy Dependence

The effects of NTGCs are enhanced at large energies. If the Z boson decays into a pair of charged leptons, a typical signal for NTGCs will be a broad increase in the invariant mass distribution of the final \(\ell\ell\gamma\) system at large values of \(M_{\ell t\gamma}\). This result is demonstrated in figure 8 which shows the invariant mass \(M_{\ell\ell\gamma}\) for the cuts described in section 3.2. In figure 8, a comparison between the mass spectrum of SM with NTGCs of \(h_{3}^{Z}=0.003\) and \(h_{4}^{Z}=0.00006\) is given, the rather large values of \(h_{3}^{Z}\) and \(h_{4}^{Z}\), which are below the unitarity limit, have been chosen to demonstrate the increase in cross section with \(M_{\ell\ell\gamma}\). Since \(h_{4}^{Z}\) receives contributions only from operators with dimension \(\geq 8\), terms in the helicity amplitudes proportional to it grow like \((\sqrt{\hat{s}}/M_{Z})^{5}\). Deviations originating from \(h_{4}^{Z}\) therefore start at higher invariant masses and rise much faster than contributions from \(h_{3}^{Z}\) which correspond to dimension 6 operators. This suggests that \(h_{3}^{Z}\) and \(h_{4}^{Z}\) can be distinguished from their different impact on the \(M_{\ell\ell\gamma}\) invariant mass distribution if a large NTGCs are observed at the LHC.

The final state photon and Z boson are produced primarily back-to-back for NTGCs and with large average transverse momentum. NTGCs lead to an increase of the cross section at high photon transverse momentum. It is clear from figure 8 that the transverse momentum cut at \(p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}>100\,GeV\) will not affect the observability of anomalies in the Z\(\gamma\gamma\) and Z\(\gamma\)Z vertices.

#### 3.4.3 Polarization

NTGCs lead to primarily longitudinally polarized Z in the final state. The polarization of the Z boson manifests itself in the angular distribution of the charged leptons, which acts as an effective spin analyzer of the Z boson. Here \(\theta_{\ell^{+}}^{*}\) is the polar angle of the charged anti-lepton in the \(\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) rest frame with respect to the \(\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) direction in the \(\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\gamma\) rest frame.

Since the Z boson couplings to charged leptons is almost purely axial vector, transversely polarized Z bosons produce an \(\sim(1+\cos^{2}\theta^{*})\) distribution, while longitudinally polarized Z bosons yield a \(\sin^{2}\theta^{*}\) distribution.

In figure 9, the \(\cos\theta^{*}_{\ell-}\) clearly exhibits the dominance of the transverse Z boson in the SM. In the presence of NTGCs, the \(\cos\theta^{*}_{\ell-}\) distribution exhibits the form of an almost \(\sin^{2}\theta^{*}\). If a big NTGCs is seen as an excess in the \(p_{T}(Z)\) distribution, this angular distributions will provide an additional test.

The photon pseudo-rapidity distribution is shown in figure 10, the contribution of SM and NTGC are clearly concentrated in the central region because hard photon populates primarily the central region in the photon rapidity.

However, these effects are very small (figure 10) for an integrated luminosity of \(100\,fb^{-1}\).

## 4 Interpretation

### Impact of the Form Factor on the Sensitivity Limits

In figure 11, the dependence of the effects of NTGCs on the scale and the power of the form factor is investigated (see equation 2). As expected the effects of anomalous couplings grow with \(\Lambda_{FF}\). The higher the scale \(\Lambda_{FF}\) is, the most enhanced the cross section in

Figure 8: _Distribution of \(p_{T}(\gamma)\) (left) and invariant mass \(\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\gamma(\ell=e,\mu)\) (right) for an integrated luminosity \(100\,fb^{-1}\). The distributions are shown for the Standard Model (shaded histograms) and for \(h_{Z}^{5}=0.003\) (dashed histogram) and \(h_{Z}^{4}=0.00006\) (solid histogram). A form factor of \(\Lambda=8\,TeV\) was used._

presence of NTGCs will be. Similarly, a more drastic cutoff corresponding to a larger value of n leads to less additional events at large invariant masses as shown in figure 11. Together with the denominator power n, \(\Lambda_{FF}\) is a parameter of the model. As long as the choice of n is fixed, the scale \(\Lambda_{FF}\) is the only free parameter.

The dependence of the anomalous couplings limits on the form factor scale \(\Lambda_{FF}\) is

illustrated in figure 12, where the confidence limits for \(h_{3}^{Z}(h_{4}^{Z})\) couplings are presented as a function of \(\Lambda_{FF}\), for a dipole form factor with n = 3(n = 4). The limits are obtained using a parameterization maximum likelihood fit to the \(p_{T}(\gamma)\) distribution. The unitarity limit curve is superimposed and is given by the following equations [11].

\[|h_{1,3}^{Z}|<\frac{0.126\,TeV^{3}}{\Lambda^{3}}\frac{(\frac{2}{3}n)^{n}}{( \frac{2}{3}n-1)^{(n-\frac{2}{3})}} \tag{4}\]

\[|h_{2,4}^{Z}|<\frac{2.1\times 10^{3}\,TeV^{5}}{\Lambda^{5}}\frac{(\frac{2}{5}n)^{ n}}{(\frac{2}{3}n-1)^{(n-\frac{5}{2})}} \tag{5}\]

\[|h_{1,3}^{\gamma}|<\frac{0.151\,TeV^{3}}{\Lambda^{3}}\frac{(\frac{2}{3}n)^{n} }{(\frac{2}{3}n-1)^{(n-\frac{2}{3})}} \tag{6}\]

\[|h_{2,4}^{\gamma}|<\frac{2.5\times 10^{3}\,TeV^{5}}{\Lambda^{5}}\frac{( \frac{2}{5}n)^{n}}{(\frac{2}{3}n-1)^{(n-\frac{5}{2})}} \tag{7}\]

Above this theoretical curve, the unitarity is violated. Figure 13 shows the limits on the pair of NGTCs \((h_{3}^{Z},h_{4}^{Z})\) form the \(P_{T}(\gamma)\) fit assuming \(\Lambda=2\) TeV. Contours represent 68% and 95% CL. Also shown is the limits obtained from partial wave unitarity limit [2] for a form factor \(\Lambda_{FF}=2TeV\).

As shown in figure 12, limits depend strongly on the scale and functional form.

If no deviations from Standard Model are seen, nor any results from direct searches, then one would derive limits on NGTCs.

Ideally, the limits should be given as a function of the scale \(\Lambda\). At high \(\Lambda\), there is asymptotic limit because of machine, energy and luminosity limitations convoluted with analysis sensitivity. For the LHC, this gives \(\Lambda=8\,TeV\)

### Limits on the anomalous couplings

In this section the methods used to set limits on anomalous couplings will be presented. To estimate limits, a likelihood fit to \(p_{T}(\gamma)\) and the other kinematical variables is performed.

Figure 12: _Limits on \(h_{3}^{Z}\) and \(h_{4}^{Z}\) couplings at the 95% confidence level as a function of \(\Lambda_{FF}\). The limits are derived using a binned maximum likelihood fit to the \(p_{T}(\gamma)\) distribution._

Figure 13: _68% and 95% contours limits, the dotted line shows the unitarity limit for \(\Lambda_{FF}=2\,TeV\). The limits are derived using a binned maximum likelihood fit to the \(p_{T}(\gamma)\) distribution._In deriving the sensitivity limits, channels with electrons and muons in the final state will be combined.

This method usually provides tighter limits than methods based on the cross section, since it uses all the information contained in the different distributions, and is less sensitive to the overall normalization factor. In fitting the shape of the \(p_{T}(\gamma)\) spectrum it is possible to use either a binned or unbinned method.

Here, a binned likelihood fit to distributions of the variable was performed, combined with the total cross section information.

The expected data set was simulated by Poisson-fluctuating the predicted number of events in each bin of the Standard Model photon distribution after the fast detector simulation, in order to account for statistical fluctuations. The reference distributions are obtained for different values of the couplings by using the fact that the cross section is a quadratic function of the anomalous couplings (see equation 3).

The likelihood function is calculated as above. For each \(p_{T}\) bin a Poisson likelihood is given as:

\[P_{i}=\frac{e^{-(b_{i}+\varepsilon\sigma_{i}\mathcal{L})}(b_{i}+L\varepsilon \sigma_{i})^{n_{i}}}{n_{i}!} \tag{8}\]

here \(b_{i}\) is the expected background, \(\mathcal{L}\) is the total integrated luminosity, \(\epsilon\) is the efficiency deduced from Monte Carlo, \(\sigma_{i}\) is the cross section and \(n_{i}\) is the number of events in the \(i^{th}\) bin.

Therefore, the probability of observing the given distribution assuming uncorrelated bins is given by the following relation:

\[P=\prod_{i=1}^{N_{b}}P_{i}\]

where \(N_{b}\) is the number of bins in the histogram. The negative log likelihood is given by:

\[\ln L=-\ln P=-\sum_{i=1}^{N_{b}}(n_{i}\ln\left(b_{i}+\varepsilon\sigma_{i} \mathcal{L}\right)-(b_{i}+\varepsilon\sigma_{i}\mathcal{L})) \tag{9}\]

where the constant term has been omitted.

The fit procedure has been tested, the central value of the fit results have been found to correctly reproduce the value of the input NTGCs parameters.

The 95% confidence level (CL) bounds on the eight anomalous coupling have been obtained by convoluting the likelihood function with a Gaussian whose width \(\sigma\) corresponds to the systematic on the individual parameters as estimated in section 3.3. In order to determine the sensitivity to NTGCs, the \(p_{T}(\gamma)\) spectrum is used, and two other sets of variables: \((M_{t^{+}t-\gamma},\eta^{*})\), \(\eta^{*}\) is the pseudo-rapidity of the photon and \((p_{T}(\gamma),\theta^{*})\) where \(\theta^{*}\) is the decay angle are used. These sets of parameters consist of one variable sensitive to the energy behavior and one sensitive to angular information.

### Results

The expected limit at 95% CL on the NTGCs obtained from fits to binned distributions of observable are listed in table 5 and 6, for an integrated luminosity of \(100\,fb^{-1}\) and \(\Lambda_{FF}=8TeV\). Only one NGTC is allowed to vary each time while the other couplingsare set to their standard model values. The limits are obtained averaging over a large number (\(\sim 10000\)) of LHC "experiments" (simulated data samples).

The statistical sensitivity is of the order \({\cal O}\) (\(3.10^{-4}\)) for \(h^{V}_{1,3}(V=Z,\gamma)\) couplings and \({\cal O}\) (\(7.10^{-7}\)) for \(h^{V}_{2,4}(V=Z,\gamma)\). The sensitivity bounds for \(h^{\gamma}\) couplings are about 20% weaker than those found for the corresponding \(h^{Z}\) couplings. The difference in sensitivity between \(h^{Z}\) and \(h^{\gamma}\) couplings is due to differences in the differential cross section at high energies between \({\rm Z}\gamma\gamma\) and \({\rm Z}\gamma{\rm Z}\) couplings which are controlled by \(Zf\,\overline{f}\) and \(\gamma f\overline{f}\) couplings and by the parton distribution functions. An example of log-likelihood functions is shown in figure 14.

The sensitivity to NTGCs lies mainly in high-end energy spectrum with very small contribution from angular information.

Multi-parameter fits show a large correlation between \(h^{Z,\gamma}_{1,3}\) and \(h^{Z,\gamma}_{2,4}\). The \(h^{V}_{1,2}\) and \(h^{V}_{3,4}\) couplings do not interfere, as expected from the CP-odd nature of \(h^{V}_{1,2}\) and CP-even nature of \(h^{V}_{3,4}\). This is illustrated in figure 15 which shown a 68% (\(\Delta(\ln L)=1.15\)) and 95%

Only \((h_{3}^{Z},h_{4}^{Z})\) and \((h_{1}^{\gamma},h_{3}^{\gamma})\) planes are show as an example.

By changing the jet veto threshold from \(30\,GeV\) to \(40\,GeV\), the limits change by typically \(5\%\).

CMS has performed a study of \(\mathrm{Z}\gamma\mathrm{Z}\) couplings for range of different form factor scale, as motivated in section 4.1. Table 7 summarizes the sensitivity limits obtained by ATLAS (this study) and CMS as reported in [34]. CMS is vetoing events with a jet of \(P_{T}(jet)>50.\,GeV\) and \(|\eta(jet)|<3\) instead of \(30\,GeV\) and therefore has limits slightly worse. In addition \(95\%\) CL limits of [34] correspond to \(\Delta(\ln L)=3\).

In this section, the limits are obtained when a binned likelihood fit to the \(p_{T}(\gamma)\) spectrum is used. If events of significant NTGCs are observed, the structure and the scale of the form factor must be determined in order to have meaningful results.

In reference [5], it was pointed out that one can in principle determine the form factor by measuring the \(\sqrt{s}\) distribution of the NTGC measured. A detailed study of the method

was performed for \(W(\to e\nu,\mu\nu)\gamma\) study at the LHC in [35] and for

\({\rm Z}Z\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}(l=e,\mu)\) in [33].

If non-zero anomalous couplings are observed, the method may be useful in determining the shape of the form factor which provides indirect information on the dynamics of the underlying new physics.

## 5 Conclusion

At the LHC, with \(100\,fb^{-1}\), the NTGCs can be measured with an accuracy of \(7.10^{-7}\) for \(h_{2,t}^{Z,\gamma}\) and \(3.10^{-4}\) for \(h_{1,3}^{Z,\gamma}\) assuming \(\Lambda_{FF}=8\,TeV\). This sensitivity limit can be compared with the bounds from recent measurement at LEP2 [1]:

\[-0.12<h_{1}^{Z}<0.12\ \ \ -0.07<h_{2}^{Z}<0.07\ \ \ -0.18<h_{3}^{Z}<0.06\ \ \ -0.18<h_{4}^{Z}<0.06\]

\[-0.05<h_{1}^{\gamma}<0.05\ \ \ -0.04<h_{2}^{\gamma}<0.02\ \ \ -0.04<h_{3}^{\gamma}<0.00\ \ \ 0.00<h_{4}^{\gamma}<0.03\]

(The LEP2 limits do not contain any form factor effect). In Run II at the TeVatron, CDF and DO will improve some of these bounds ( by a factor up to 30 for \(h_{1}^{Z}\) and \(h_{2}^{Z}\)) [36].

The strong increase in the sensitivity limits at the LHC is due to the pronounced high \(\hat{s}\) dependence at the LHC of the \({\rm Z}\gamma{\rm Z}\) and \({\rm Z}\gamma\gamma\) couplings. A small choice of the form factor scale would cut off this enhancement and diminish the sensitivity considerably.

This is a NLL study, the jet veto reduces NLL effects. The limits obtained for \(h_{2,4}^{Z,\gamma}\) and \(h_{1,3}^{Z,\gamma}\) are different, because these operators have different dimensionality. Although the LHC

Shown are \(1\sigma\) and \(2\sigma\) limit contours of all combinations of \(h_{i}^{Z}\) versus \(h_{i}^{\gamma}\). A form factor scale of \(\Lambda_{FF}=8\,TeV\) has been assumed.

luminosity will allow binning in multi dimensions, using multi-variable log likelihood fits does not significantly improve the result over using the \(p_{T}(\gamma)\) distribution alone.
