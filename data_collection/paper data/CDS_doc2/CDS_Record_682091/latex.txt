Lead ABSORBER PRODUCTION FOR THE

ENDCAP MODULE 0

**Gaston Garcia Lopez**

**Universidad Autonoma de Madrid**Introduction

In a previous note (see [1]) we studied the design and performance of the thickness control system to be applied to lead absorber plates for the ATLAS Electromagnetic Calorimeter. The importance of fulfilling thickness tolerance restrictions was emphasized and the technical features of the measurement method explained in detail. These points will be therefore taken as granted.

The goal of this note is to analyze all data available about the thickness of lead absorber plates to become part of module 0. There are 106 large and 54 small absorbers. These data are basically:

* Thickness values measured with the ultrasonic system, at points on a 5x5 cm grid covering the whole of the absorber (some 440 points on large absorbers and 100 on small ones).
* Some additional information about the absorber and the ultrasonic measurements.
* Thickness measurements performed at the factory using an X-ray source and a set of photo-multiplier tubes, on a grid of about 10x10 cm (that is, coarser than that of ultrasonic measurements). These measurements are not expected to be as precise as ultrasonic ones, but were extremely useful as an online selection criterion: plates were only cut from parts of the roll where thickness readings were close to the nominal value.

The note will start with a quick synthesis of the production process. Then we will describe the data existing about each absorber. This will lead us to a detailed analysis, consisting of four parts:

* First we will see qualitatively what the thickness profiles of absorbers look like. The main idea is to show that ultrasounds are sensitive to features of order a few microns.
* It is very important to check that the measuring device calibration is stable. This type of check must be done on each plate and thoroughly analyzed.

* The quality of each absorber can, to a first approximation, be synthesized in two numbers: mean thickness and rms. Probably the main result given in this note is the description of what typical values we get for these two parameters and how they vary from absorber to absorber.
* To finish with, a consistency cross-check of X-ray and ultrasonic measurements will be done. As it was stated previously the former are not expected to be precise enough as to replace the latter (although this possibility should not be discarded in principle), but still one would like to take profit of the fact that both measurement systems are independent in order to make sure that they work properly.

## 2 Lead production process.

Two types of constant thickness absorbers are required for the Endcap: large (1.7 mm-thick) and small (2.2 mm-thick). The part of the lead absorber plate production relevant for our analysis can be summarized in three phases:

* First a very long lead roll (think of a roll of paper) with the correct thickness is laminated at a German factory. Absorbers for module 0 come from four different rolls: the so-called 8, 9 and 10 (for large absorbers), and 11 (for small ones). In principle, operating conditions do not have to be identical for all four rolls. Therefore it will be very important at some points of the analysis to keep track of the roll each absorber comes from.
* Plates of dimensions 1504x1005 mm are cut from the roll and shipped to Madrid, where the ultrasonic thickness control is performed.
* Afterwards the lead is sent to a factory in Guipuzcoa (Spain) where the absorber, with the shape recquired for final assembly, is cut from the plate. Each thin plate gives rise to one large absorber, and each thick plate to three small absorbers.

The basic unit of information regarding thickness control is the ABSORBER. However it must be kept in mind that small absorbers can be naturally grouped is sets of three, coming from the same plate. Some of the information available about an absorber (like the name of the operator, temperature, calibration checks, etc...) will be the same for each group of three small absorbers.

## 3 Some qualitative features of absorber thickness profiles.

Thickness measurements performed with ultrasonic signals have proved successful to show features of order a few microns. X-ray online measurements suggested aperiodic modulation of thickness along the roll. This type of behaviour should be seen on thickness maps. Figure 1 shows two examples. The rolling direction is that defined by the x-axis. The modulation is more apparent in the plate shown in the upper part of the figure.

Another outstandig feature observed on most plates is the appearance of incorrect thickness readings whenever the plate shows superficial defects. If one goes back to the point where a strange thickness was found and measures carefully it can be seen that the reading is not stable. These values, appearing on the map as sharp peaks, should thus be regarded as spurious.

## 4 Information about absorber thickness control on the www.

All data from thickness measurements are available through the World Wide Web at URL address [http://www.uam.es/Alt.Ener/plomo.html](http://www.uam.es/Alt.Ener/plomo.html) (accessible from ATLAS pages). For each absorber there is a file with the format shown by figure 2.

The serial number identifies the absorber, starting with 6000 for the Endcap.

The roll name tells us from which of the rolls laminated at the factory the absorber was cut.

The absorber number identifies the position in the ATLAS detector. The first field gives the detector unit (B for the Barrel, A for the Endcap). The next two digits stand for the module number (eight modules for each Endcap, numbered clockwise as seen from the interaction point, from one to eight for the Endcap laying in the positive direction along the beamline, according to the ATLAS coordinate system, and from 9 to 16 for the other one). The next digit is 0 for the inner and 1 for the outer wheel. The last field gives the position within the module, also counting clockwise as seen from the IP.

Date and time are given in standard format. Temperature is in degrees Celsius and sound velocity in kilometers per second.

The two numbers of four digits on the next line are the thicknesses at the calibration point measured with a Palmer micrometer and with the ultrasonic device (both given in microns). This information is the same for each set of three small absorbers coming from the same plate. As it was shown when describing calibration in [1] u-thickness (measured via ultrasounds) should be about 9\(\mu m\) larger than p-thickness (measured with the Palmer).

Mean and rms of all u-thicknesses on the absorber are given in microns. The next two lines are not used in module 0, since the presence of superficial defects with spurious thickness readings associated to them make the maximum and minimum values unmeaningful.

The next set of lines gives the measurement number, x and y coordinates in centimeters and u-thickness in microns. The coordinate system is that of the plate (much more proper due to its rectangular shape). Absorber shapes, positioning on plates and coordinate system are shown in figure 3.

As the roll went past the X-ray measuring device at the factory, numbers were printed on the roll, in order to identify the position of the points where x-thickness (thickness given by X-rays) had been measured. The x coordinate of the position on the plate where the number was found is given in centimeters, and the number itself is shown next. The first two digits identify the roll and the remaining three are used to find the x-thickness values on a data file assigned to each roll.

The next lines give all x-measurements, with the same format explained previously for ultrasonic ones.

To finish with, we have the possibility of adding comments.

Checking calibration.

In order to check that calibration was stable throughout the measurement process p-thickness and u-thickness were taken at one point on every plate.

Figure 4 shows the difference between these two values on all plates. The mean and rms of the distribution agree very well with the expected result (9 \(\pm\) 3\(\mu m\), according to [1]). On figure 5 the same data are separated into two groups: measurements on 2.2\(mm\)-thick plates and on 1.7\(mm\)-thick ones. The difference detected on the means is not incompatible with the error bars given in the previous note for the speed of sound. Even so, one should keep in mind that thickness is not the only difference between these two groups of plates: there is also the fact that Palmer measurements were performed by different operators and that the micrometer itself gave some problems. Before going any further a glance should be taken at figure 6, which shows all measurements done on 1.7\(mm\)-thick plates classified according to the Palmer operator.

The micrometer was checked not to be working properly at some moment during the measurement of the first thin plates (after all thick ones were done with). This misadjustment was detected partly due to the slight disagreement between p- and u-thickness actual difference and the expected value. After the Palmer was readjusted and checked to be working fine we got basically the values attributed individually to operators 1, 2 and 3 (figure 6). The agreement between different operators is quite good, although the three distributions do not look exactly the same.

The conclusions of this study about calibration are:

* The absolute calibration of the ultrasonic device kept stable throughout the whole process.
* Monitoring the difference between p- and u-thickness is important to detect possible misfunctioning of any of the devices involved. In this case the Palmer gave some problems, which were promptly detected and solved.

Therefore, when performing thickness control on next module even more attention will be paid to this type of check.

Quality of absorbers: mean thicknesses and rms's.

The most powerful and simple way to visualize at a glance if lead production was satisfactory is to look at the mean thickness and rms of each absorber. This information is shown in figure 7 for small absorbers and in figure 8 for large ones. The spread of the mean thickness values is small in both cases, and all rms's are well below \(16\mu m\) (the proposed tolerance limit). In fact results are so good that one can try to go further and ask oneself why there are a few absorbers with just good rms values whereas others are excellent. Is there any correlation between these "not-excellent" rms's and the mean thickness value? Does this correlation show up if parameters characterizing the absorber other than the mean, like the roll number, are taken into account?

The answer to the first question can be extracted from figure 9 (for small absorbers in the upper plot and for large ones in the lower one). Each point represents an absorber, whose mean thickness and rms are given by the x, y coordinates. Small Absorbers with larger rms do not show any tendency to specially large or small mean thickness. For large ones it seems that higher rms's are correlated with lower means. This suggests that these "not-excellent" 1.7 mm-thick plates come from a certain roll, or even from a part of a roll in which the laminating machine operation was not as stable as in the rest.

These are good suggestions to go on investigating where these somewhat larger rms's come from for large absorbers, and this will be done below; but what about small ones? Why there are four absorbers (see figure 7 or 9 upper again) with an rms noticeably larger than the rest?

To begin with, these "singular" small absorbers come from only two plates (two from each). Besides this, some of the \(2.2mm\)-thick plates showed a lot of superficial scratches, giving rise to unphysical thickness readings. One could think that these four absorbers are really as good as the rest, but they just have too many scratches and this spoils the rms. The best way to put this hypothesis to test is to take a look at a histogram with all u-thickness measurements of a high-rms absorber and compare with the same graph for a low-rms one. Figure 10 shows such a histogram along with a u-thickness map for a low-rms absorber (upper) and for a high-rms one (lower). It is easy to notice that the large value obtained for the rms in the second case is due to a few bad thickness readings that appear isolated on the map and can be regarded as spurious. Supressing these few data one would get something much similar to what is shown in the upper figure. In fact, the gaussian fit gives close sigmav values for both absorbers. The other three small absorbers with rms above 8\(\mu m\) look much the same as this one, so the same conclusion can be extracted for all.

Let's now move on to large absorbers. We can take advantage from what we just learned from small ones. However in this case figure 11 shows that the absorber of the upper plots does not have an unphysically large rms due to a few isolated measurements, but rather a truly larger thickness spread without apparent spatial structure. It seems that at some part of the production process operating conditions were significantly better than the rest of the time. If we classify the 106 rms values coming from large absorbers depending on the roll the plate was cut out from we get the plots shown in the upper part of figure 12. All absorbers with rms \(>8\mu m\) come from roll 10. We still see two types of absorbers in this roll. The lower part of the figure shows the rms and mean for each absorber as a function of the position that they occupy in roll 10. At the beginning worse rms values are found and the situation steadily improves as we go on along the roll. The mean thickness also shows a slight drift.

Therefore and to sum up, we have been able to detect very fine effects of the rolling procedure at the factory. This makes our data more reliable and confirms that the quality of the lead plates is excellent.

## 7 Cross-check of X-ray and ultrasound thickness measurements.

### Study of a particular plate.

A nice exercise that can be done with the data is to chose an absorber and compare the thickness maps obtained with both measurement methods. However this idea involves some problems: visual comparison of two thickness maps can not be expected to give very precise information; and, which is most important, the grid on which x-thickness was measured does not coincide with the one chosen for u-thickness control. Therefore point-to-point thickness comparison recquires a previous interpolation process.

Thickness measurements at different points of a plateau be regarded as the result of sampling a two-dimensional random variable, say \((X,U)\), where the first component is x-thickness and the second one u-thickness. If everything were perfect X and U should exactly coincide for all events, except for, perhaps, a global offset due to different calibration. Therefore we would expect the random variable \(X-U\) to have a mean close to zero and vanishing rms. There are mainly two reasons why one can not expect to see such a behaviour in reality:

* Thickness resolution attained is good, but not perfect. For ultrasound measurements individual measurements carry an uncertainty of about one micron (negligible), but the X-ray system is not so precise.
* In practice we compare each x-measurement not to a true u-measurement, but to a smoothed (interpolated) value. This intermediate step is much more troublesome than it looks at first sight. In fact it introduces an additional uncertainty than can be very important.

If X and U were not correlated at all the rms of \(X-U\) would be just the quadratic sum of the separate rms's. Anything below this limit is a proof of the correlation we expect to see.

Figure 13 shows the two thickness maps. One can see some similarities between them but, as expected, no conclusions can be drawn from visual comparison.

On figure 14 we can see the distribution of u-thickness (top), x-thickness (center) and x-minus-smoothed-u (bottom). The mean of the difference is 2 microns (close to zero as expected) and the sigma is \(8.7\mu m\), significantly smaller than the \(11.6\mu m\) one gets when adding quadratically the sigmas of the two separate distributions. This proofs that thickness measurements performed with the two methods are correlated.

### Study of all absorbers.

The analysis showed in the previous section was good to illustrate the subject. In practice it is enough to check that the mean thickness of absorbers calculated with x or u-data gives more or less the same value. In particular it is interesting to see how X-ray performance changes from roll to roll. We would also expect to see a somewhat worse behaviour for small absorbers, both because we have fewer x-measurements per absorber (the uncertainty of the mean scales like the inverse squared root of the number of measurements) and because the intrinsic resolution of the X-ray method itself is expected to deteriorate with increasing thickness.

Figures 15 and 16 compare u- and x-mean thickness values of absorbers classified in rolls.

For each roll we have on the left a diagram where each absorber has a representative point whose coordinates are the mean thicknesses with the two methods. The line appearing on the same plot is where all points should lay if correlation were perfect. On the right we show how the difference in mean thickness is distributed.

Rolls 8 and 9 show a similar behaviour: u and x mean thickness values are apparently correlated with a miscalibration of about 10\(\mu m\) (see mean of histograms on the right). The rms of the difference is really small. This means that ultrasounds and X-rays are reproducing the same information, to within a few microns, except for a global offset.

Roll 10 gives a very different behaviour. Now it seems that the global offset is not anymore present, but the rms of the difference is larger than in the previous cases. Figure 17 separates absorbers from roll 10 into those coming from the first part of the roll (with rms larger than 8\(\mu m\)) and those cut from the second part (rms smaller than 8\(\mu m\)). It seems that the X-ray system didn't measure in the same way at the beginning and at the end of the roll (notice different means of the two histograms).

On roll 11 (small absorbers), also shown in figure 16, the global offset is recovered and the dispersion increases by a factor of three. This is more or less what one would expect from the \(1/\sqrt{n}\) scaling effect explained above. It is somewhat puzzling to find two clusters of points, peaking at 5 and 20\(\mu m\). Absorbers belonging to these two groups do not have any systematicproperty in common (like coming from the same part of the roll, etc...). Perhaps this is, after all, just an effect of not high enough statistics.

To summarize this section, correlations between X-ray and ultrasound thickness measurements are very apparent on all plates, but there are still some details that suggest the X-ray system is not fully stable.

## 8 Conclusions.

This note gives a detailed analysis of the data concerning thickness control of lead absorber plates for the module zero of the ATLAS Endcap Electromagnetic Calorimeter. All data are made available through the World Wide Web so that they can be used at will by other members of the collaboration.

The note attempts to show that absolute calibration of the ultrasonic thickness measuring system was checked to be fine and that the cross-check with X-ray measurements was consistent (although a few details suggest to keep both methods and do further checks in the future). However, maybe the most important conclusion has been somewhat obscured by the large amount of information given. The main motivation for doing such a detailed thickness control on lead absorber plates was to assure that, say, an electron, would traverse lead layers of the same thickness (with very high precision) when flying across the Endcap. How precisely are these succesive layers equally thick? Can we synthesize all the analysis of these pages in a couple of numbers answering this question?

If a particle flies across the electromagnetic part of the Endcap it will generate a shower that will develop crossing about 40 lead layers (ten accordion waves times four absorbers sharing a given \(\eta\), \(\phi\) direction). Each particle of the shower will go through the layers at different points. To sum up, we have a lot of particles multiplied by a lot of crossings, and would like to have an idea of how the thicknesses associated to all these absorber points are distributed (in particular we are interested on the spread of the distribution). All these points belong to a small region of a set of a few adjacent absorbers (as placed in the detector). However, probably the best is to stick to the most conservative point of view: in order to generate the aimed-at distribution we just take the thickness at many different points of all absorbers of a given type. This can be done just putting together all ultrasound thickness measurements done on absorber plates at Madrid. Figure 18 shows this distribution for large and small absorbers, and the result is really excellent: the rms's are both below \(10\mu m_{i}\) that is, about half of what was required to get a good enough energy resolution for Physics goals. It remains to be verified that this level of homogeneity can be maintained for the whole set of plates necessary for at least one endcap(8 times the amount treated here).
