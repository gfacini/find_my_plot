**Abstract**

A motivation for the use of a second threshold Cerenkov counter in the H8 beamline is presented. It is proposed that a surplus Cerenkov counter be brought from Argonne and installed in H8, replacing the vacuum pipe just upstream of the Silicon detectors. Details on the physical parameters and performance of the counter are presented.

## 1 Introduction

The Tile Calorimeter group has used the Cerenkov counter in H8 rather haphazardly over the past years, but recently has made use of it to tag pion and proton initiated showers. The results have proved very interesting as noted in the November, 1997, ATLAS week analysis meeting.

At low energies (\(\leq\)10 GeV), the Cerenkov counter with its gas fill of helium, enabled us to tag electrons in the beam and not much more. Although restrictive, this tag was actually necessary in the analysis, since low energy pions and electrons yield similar signals in the Tile calorimeter.

At medium energies (\(\sim\)100 GeV) with a helium fill, the Cerenkov counter allowed us to tag protons. At energies above \(\sim\)200 GeV, the Cerenkov counter pretty much becomes useless. Thus, below about 200 GeV we can select proton or other hadron induced showers.

Note that with a single threshold counter, if the _yes/no_response is such that a proton is signalled with a _no_, then a _yes_tag implies an ambiguous particle, either an e, \(\mu,\pi\) or K. However with a second threshold counter set at a threshold different than the first, we are able to unambiguously determine the beam particle (with the aid of the calorimeter to separate electrons and muons or pions). This is indicated in Table 1. For example, with C1 set at K threshold, and C2 set at p threshold, K's and p's are uniquely identified, while the calorimeter needs to distinguish an e from a \(\mu\) or a \(\pi\).

The aim of the second Cerenkov counter is to allow us to extend to lower momenta for proton selection, and also to allow us to tag kaon induced showers.

## 2 Cerenkov Response

### Design

The Cerenkov counter at Argonne consists of a 1.5 m length of 17 cm diameter Aluminum pipe. At the upstream end of this pipe is welded a CERN

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \hline C1 & Response & C2 Response & C1 Tag & C2 Tag & Resultant Beam Particle \\ \hline Yes & Yes & Fe\(\mu\pi\) & Fe\(\mu\pi\) K & e\(\mu\pi\) \\ Yes & No & Fe\(\mu\pi\) & p &? \\ No & Yes & Kp & e\(\mu\pi\) K & K \\ No & No & Kp & p & p \\ \hline \hline
**C1 set at \(\pi\) threshold, C2 set at K threshold** & & & & \\ \hline \hline C1 & Response & C2 Response & C1 Tag & C2 Tag & Resultant Beam Particle \\ \hline Yes & Yes & Fe\(\mu\) & Fe\(\mu\pi\) & e\(\mu\) \\ Yes & No & Fe\(\mu\) & Kp &? \\ No & Yes & \(\pi\) Kp & e\(\mu\pi\) & \(\pi\) \\ No & No & \(\pi\) Kp & Kp & Kp \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: C1 and C2 Resultant Tagstandard beampipe flange. This flange will allow mating to any length of CERN-provided standard beam pipe. The downstream end of the counter has an exit window of 300 \(\mu\) mylar, covered by a thin piece of black polyethylene. The standard CERN beampipe windows are 150 \(\mu\) mylar. It is expected that when the CERN beampipe is mated to the front of the Cerenkov counter, the total length of radiator will be about 9 m. Maximum pressure will be about the same as the standard beampipe pressure of 3.3 Bar.

The spherical mirror inside the pipe has a useful diameter of about 15 cm. The mirror is aluminized plastic with a thickness of about 4 mm. The interior of the pipe is covered with aluminized mylar to aid in light collection. Cerenkov light reflected off the mirror passes through an 11 mm thick plexiglas window before being detected by a 5" RCA 4522 phototube. The plexiglas window acts as a vacuum/gas seal.

### Performance

We can estimate the light yield using the simple formula in the Particle Data Booklet. The efficiency can be calculated from the number of photoelectrons as \(1-exp(-N_{pe})\) where \(N_{pe}\) is calculated as

\[N_{pe}=70cm^{-1}\cdot L_{R}\cdot sin^{2}\theta_{C}\]

\[=70cm^{-1}\cdot L_{R}\cdot(1-\frac{1}{\beta^{2}n^{2}})\]

\[=70cm^{-1}\cdot L_{R}\cdot 2\cdot(\epsilon P-\frac{m^{2}}{2p^{2}})\]

where \(D/2tan\theta_{C}\leq L_{R}\leq 900\) cm, p is the beam momentum, D=15 cm is the mirror diameter, P is the pressure in the Cerenkov counter (in bar), and \(n=1+\epsilon P\) is the index of refraction of the radiator. For most of the lower energies, the Cerenkov cone is small, and the entire 900 cm of the radiator is used.

In order operate at reasonable detector pressures we have explored the effect of using helium, nitrogen or carbon dioxide as radiators. For helium, nitrogen and carbon dioxide, the following \(\epsilon\) were used:\[\epsilon_{He} = 35x10^{-6}\] \[\epsilon_{N_{2}} = 298x10^{-6}\] \[\epsilon_{CO_{2}} = 450x10^{-6}\]

In Figure 1 we show the efficiency for detecting an e, \(\mu,\pi,K\) or p as a function of detector pressure for several energies and for a gas fill of helium. These curves are similar to what one obtains for the existing Cerenkov counter in H8. At energies \(\stackrel{{<}}{{\sim}}\)50 GeV, the proton threshold is above the maximum pressure allowable in the counter. But with the denser gases, \(N_{2}\) and \(CO_{2}\), proton threshold is attainable even at 10 GeV as seen in Figures 2 and 3. Furthermore, with a variety of gases, operating pressures can be varied through a wide range.

As expected, any kind of particle separation at energies \(\stackrel{{>}}{{\sim}}\)200 GeV cannot be done.

## 3 Conclusion
