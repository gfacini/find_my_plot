## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS MDT system is designed to work in a high rate background environment. Count rates up to \(1500\,\mathrm{Hz/cm}\) in one MDT - including a safety factor 5 - are expected (see figure 1).

The most important background constituents are low-energy neutrons, photons, electrons, muons and hadrons originating from primary hadrons interacting with the forward calorimeter, the shielding inside the end-cap toroid, the beam pipe, and other machine elements. While most of the energy carried by secondary particles is absorbed in the forward shielding, low-energy neutrons, one of the components of the final stages of the absorption process, will escape the absorber and create, via nuclear n-\(\gamma\) processes, a low-energy photon "gas".

The neutron sensitivity of one MDT is \(\sim 10^{-3}\)[2], and the gamma sensitivity in average over our expected photon energy distribution is measured to be \(\sim 4.5\cdot 10^{-3}\)[3]. Simulations determined the average energy deposit of a background photon to be \(\sim 36\,\mathrm{keV}\) at a magnetic field of \(0.6\,\mathrm{T}\)[4].

This note discusses the impact of high background rates on the single tube performance and investigates in detail the background rate dependence of the efficiency and resolution. The studies have been carried out using different pulse-shaping schemes.

Figure 1: _Pseudo-rapidity dependence of the total counting rate in the three precision-chamber stations at nominal luminosity [2]._Experimental Setup and Rate Environment

The rate studies described in this note were made in the Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF) in the SPS beam line X5 (figure 2).

This common test facility of the ATLAS and CMS groups has a 100 GeV muon beam and a \({}^{137}\)Cs source with an activity of 740 GBq emitting 662 keV Gammas, which deposit on average an energy of about 36 keV in our MDT's, simulating well the photon background in ATLAS. The actual gamma rate can be adjusted by choosing an appropriate combination of several lead filters. Details about the radiation environment resulting from this setup will be presented further below.

The tubes that we used for our investigations were part of the Seattle/Boston MDT chamber prototype consisting of two triple layers of drift tubes with a typical length of 2 m. The tubes were operated with "Datcha Gas" (Ar/N\({}_{2}\)/CH\({}_{4}=91/4/5\)) at 3 bar pressure and with a gain of \(2\times 10^{4}\).

The external reference system for the resolution and efficiency measurements was ODYSSEUS [5], a beam telescope consisting of 6 Silicon micro-strip detectors with 7 \(\mu\)m resolution each. 4 out of the 6 planes measure the precision coordinate perpendicular to the MDT wires, the other 2 detectors give us the second coordinate parallel to the wires. By extrapolation of the silicon telescope track to the chamber we get a prediction accuracy of 15 \(\mu\)m.

Figure 2: _The setup in the X5-GIF zone._

The silicon detectors cover an area of 5.1 \(\times\) 5.1 cm\({}^{2}\). Thus in both multilayers there is a "flower" of 7 MDTs lying partly within the window defined by ODYSSEUS. For our purposes we only used the downstream "flower" (figure 3).

As front-end electronics (figure 4) we used BNL preamplifiers [6] and different kinds of shapers which will be explained in section 3.

The signals from tubes n\({}^{o}\) 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7 were then split and discriminated with two different thresholds (25 and 100 primary electrons) before being registered by TDCs. The high threshold was used for time slewing correction (section 6.1.3) and double track separation studies (section 5).

The signals from tubes n\({}^{o}\) 2 and 5 were also split, but here the second signal half was fed into a FADC allowing us to look at complete pulse shapes (section 3.1).

Figure 5a shows the full gamma spectrum of the source with collimators but without any filters [7]. The dominant contribution is the 662 keV line at the upper limit of the spectrum.

Figure 4: _The readout chain of the 7 tubes analysed in this study._

Figure 3: _The “flower” of the 7 drift tubes in the downstream multi-layer of the Seattle/Boston chamber which were covered by the silicon telescope._

At lower energies one sees a continuum due to Compton scattering in the collimators and the 72.1 keV Pb escape peak. Putting filters in front of the source not only attenuates the emission but also smoothens the spectrum by enhancing Compton scattering (figure 5b).

There is a curved filter permanently fixed in place to flatten the planes of equal gamma flux perpendicular to the beam axis. This avoids a lateral dependence of the count rate in the detectors under study. However, as the measured rate profile in figure 6a shows, these collimators are not perfect: There is still a slight dependence of the rate on the x-coordinate. At the end of the 1.90 m long tubes the rate is between 84 and 91 % of the rate in the middle (figure 6b).

Figure 5: _Gamma spectrum at 117.4 cm from the source in free air: (a) Spectral contributions with collimators but without filters. (b) Spectra for different filter configurations_

Within the beam-centered trigger area of 10 cm width the rate can be considered as being constant.

Figure 6: _(a) Rate profile along the \(x\)-coordinate at \(z\) = 1.72 m. The source is positioned at \(x=z=0\). For the measurement a 6\(\times\)6\(\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}\) scintillator was used. The solid lines represent quadratic fits to the measured points. The true (calibrated) attenuation factors are lower than the nominal ones. (b) Ratio between the rates at the ends and in the middle of the tubes as a function of the attenuation factor._

By varying the combination of filters one can obtain attenuation factors ranging between 1 and 300 as indicated in figure 6a above the solid lines. For each curve (filter combination) this mean attenuation \(A\) is defined as

\[A=\frac{\frac{1}{L}\int_{x_{min}}^{x_{max}}R_{\text{no filter}}(x)\,dx}{\frac{1}{L }\int_{x_{min}}^{x_{max}}R_{\text{filter}}(x)\,dx} \tag{1}\]

where \(x_{min}\) and \(x_{max}\) are the \(x\)-coordinates of the tube ends, \(L=x_{max}-x_{min}\) the tube length and \(R(x)\) the count rate parametrized as shown in figure 6a.

Figure 7 shows the gamma rate per unit tube length as a function of the attenuation factor. The maximum ATLAS rate of about 1500 Hz/cm (horizontal line) is well within the scope of the X5 setup.

The Shaping Schemes

### Pulse Shapes

In order to investigate the impact of the shaping on the single tube resolution, three different shaping schemes were applied. Example pulses for each of them are shown in figure 9. As we will discuss in section 3.3 the impact of the shaping scheme on high rate MDT performance is mainly determined by the amount of baseline shift.

On the BNL shapers, consisting in principle of two pole/zero filters in series (each of them behaving as in equation (2)), the time constants \(\tau\) can be adjusted with potentiometers on the board to give different transfer functions:

\[f(s)=\frac{s+\frac{1}{\tau_{1}}}{s+\frac{1}{\tau_{2}}},\qquad\text{with} \qquad\begin{array}{l}\tau_{1}=R_{1}C\\ \tau_{2}=\frac{R_{1}R_{2}C}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\\ \tau_{1}>\tau_{2}\end{array}\qquad\begin{array}{l}\tau_{1}=R_{1}C\\ \tau_{2}=\frac{R_{1}R_{2}C}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\\ \tau_{1}>\tau_{2}\end{array}\qquad\begin{array}{l}\tau_{2}=\frac{R_{1}R_{2}C} {R_{1}+R_{2}}\\ \tau_{1}>\tau_{2}\end{array} \tag{2}\]

In the first pole/zero filter only \(R_{1}\) is adjustable, in the second one \(R_{1}\) and \(R_{2}\).

Figure 8: _Real muon pulses were convoluted with the transfer function of a pole/zero filter. Depending on the potentiometer settings on the shaper board the ion tail can be under-compensated (\(C=20\,\mathrm{p}\mathrm{F}\), \(R_{1}\approx 100\,\Omega\), \(R_{2}=1\,\mathrm{k}\Omega\rightarrow\tau_{1}=2\,\mathrm{ns}\), \(\tau_{2}=1.8\,\mathrm{ns}\), solid line) or over-compensated (\(C=20\,\mathrm{p}\mathrm{F}\), \(R_{1}\approx\ 8.4\,\mathrm{k}\Omega\), \(R_{2}=1\,\mathrm{k}\Omega\rightarrow\tau_{1}=168\,\mathrm{ns}\), \(\tau_{2}=17.9\,\mathrm{ns}\), dashed line). For the unipolar shaping with undershoot the second case was chosen._

* Unipolar shaping: This shaping scheme was optimized for a good trailing edge resolution. Consequently the tail (\(\propto\frac{1}{t_{0}+t}\)) of the ion signal was compensated by carefully adjusted \(\tau\)-constants. The cancellation of the tail is not possible for the whole ion drift time since the pole/zero filters provide only exponential functions for compensation. Nevertheless a reduction to a few per cent is possible, depending on the event position along the wire.
* Unipolar shaping with undershoot: For high background rates the baseline shift and baseline fluctuations contribute to resolution deterioration. In order to minimize these effects, the \(R_{1}\)-values in the two filters were put to the highest possible values. Such settings over-compensate the ion tail and produce an undershoot leading to a quicker restoration of the baseline (see figure 8).
* Bipolar shaping: The final electronics will use active baseline restoration. This new electronics is not available yet; instead the baseline shift was avoided with bipolar shaping. Since the signal is compensated by an undershoot, the baseline stays fixed. Our bipolar shapers had twice the peaking time of our unipolar shapers. Therefore the resolution is worse with and without background rate. But this didn't affect the main objective of studying bipolar shaping, namely avoiding baseline shift and baseline fluctuations (see sections 3.3 and 3.4).

Figure 9: _Different kinds of pulse shaping._

### Hit Multiplicity

None of our shaping schemes was optimized regarding hit multiplicity. The goal in the final ATLAS electronics is that each muon pulse will have only one threshold crossing in order to minimize the amount of data. This section should only show the principal differences between the different shaping schemes, although none of them reached the desired aim of only one hit per muon.

Figure 10 shows the dependence of the hit multiplicity on the threshold. Introducing a hysteresis2, a big improvement for the unipolar shaping can be seen. For the unipolar shaping with undershoot as well as for the bipolar shaping the multiplicity stays almost unchanged. This is due to the fact that for shaping schemes with over-compensation of the ion tail the muon pulse anyway crosses the baseline to negative values.

Figure 10: _Hit multiplicity for muons. In plot (b) a hysteresis with a lower level of 12\({}^{-}\) was applied; a big improvement for the unipolar shaping can be observed. Plot (c) illustrates why the number of hits increases with higher thresholds for the unipolar shaping, and decreases for bipolar shaping._

### Baseline Shift

Since our tube and the electronics are AC-coupled, the integral over a full signal including its tail always has to be zero. For high rates on a tube this implies a baseline shift to negative values as shown in figure 11.

Figure 12 compares the baseline shifts for unipolar shaping with undershoot and bipolar shaping. As expected at a background rate of 333.5 kHz per tube the baseline shift for

Figure 11: _Origin of the baseline shift. The rectangular pulses symbolize background pulses, the areas above and below the time axis have to cancel each other._

Figure 12: _Comparison of baseline shifts. The plots show histograms of the baseline (FADC readout) before the recorded muon pulse. In (a) and (b) the source was switched off, in (c) and (d) the photon background rate in the tube was 333.5 kHz. Comparing (a) and (c) one sees a baseline shift of \(-8.7\)\(\mathrm{e}^{-}\); for the bipolar shaping the shift is much smaller (\(-1\,\mathrm{e}^{-}\)). The non-gaussian tails in (d) are due to signal under- and overshoots after photon pulses._bipolar shaping is negligible (\(-1\) e\({}^{-}\)), whereas for the unipolar shaping with undershoot the baseline is shifted by \(-8.7\) e\({}^{-}\) (compare figure 13).

### Baseline Fluctuations

Since the background pulses are not equally distributed in time but exponentially, and the energy deposit varies, too, we do not expect the baseline to be constant but to fluctuate around a mean value, as seen in figure 12. In (a) and (b) the width of the distribution is due to the noise level. In (c) the baseline fluctuations add up quadratically with the \(\sigma_{noise}\):

\[\sigma_{noise+fluct}=\sqrt{\sigma_{noise}^{2}+\sigma_{fluct}^{2}}. \tag{3}\]

Application of equation 3 to the values shown in figure 12 yields \(\sigma_{fluct}=2.6\) e\({}^{-}\) for the unipolar shaping with undershoot. The unipolar shaping without undershoot produces big baseline fluctuations of \(6.4\) e\({}^{-}\) at \(333.5\) kHz per tube.

For the bipolar shaping the distribution of the baseline level remains almost unchanged (see figure 12 (b) and (d)) except for non-gaussian tails due to signal under- and overshoots after a photon pulse. This means that bipolar shaping suppresses baseline fluctuations as well as baseline shift.

Baseline shift and baseline fluctuations both have a big impact on the single tube resolution (see section 6.1.2).

Figure 13: _Baseline shift as a function of the background rate for our 3 different shaping schemes._

## 4 Efficiency

This chapter discusses the dependence of the MDT Efficiency on the background rate and the shaping scheme. We will consider two different efficiencies:

* The hit efficiency indicates the probability that a muon going through a tube is registered at all. No quality criterion is applied to the reconstructed hit radius.
* The \(3\sigma\)-efficiency indicates the probability that a muon passing through a tube is detected and the reconstructed hit radius is within \(3\sigma\) from the true value, where \(\sigma\) is the spatial resolution at the respective track radius. This efficiency definition thus characterizes the importance of the tails in a residual distribution.

Both efficiencies have been measured using the information of ODYSSEUS as an external tracker.

### Hit Efficiency

The hit efficiency remains very high even with a radiation background. Figure 14 shows the rate dependence of the hit inefficiency averaged over hit radii between 0 and 14 mm for the unipolar and the bipolar shaping. In our average we exclude the 0.6 mm near the wall because in this domain the MDT starts becoming inefficient anyway [10][8], and efficiency fluctuations as well as systematic errors due to wire displacements are bigger than the small rate-effect we are looking for.

The efficiency deterioration depends crucially on the shaping: It is most accentuated for the unipolar shaping due to its important negative baseline shift which increases the effective

Figure 14: _Hit inefficiency as a function of the gamma rate for unipolar and bipolar shaping._threshold. Therefore with a background more muon pulses stay below the threshold than without background. This effect however is very small: The maximum inefficiency is a few per-mille.

For the bipolar shaping there is no baseline shift. The tiny increase of inefficiency can be explained with the gain loss due to space charge effects which - in a similar way as a baseline shift - means a higher effective threshold.

### 3\(\sigma\)-Efficiency

During track reconstruction typically only hits within 3 times the spatial resolution will be used. The amount of successfully reconstructed hits can be quantified by the 3\(\sigma\)-efficiency defined as

\[\eta_{3\sigma}=\frac{\text{hits with }|r_{recon}-r_{true}|<3\,\sigma(r_{true}, \Phi)}{\text{all tracks in a distance }r\text{ from the wire (given by ODYSSEUS)}}\quad. \tag{4}\]

For the spatial resolution \(\sigma(r,\Phi)\) at the track distance \(r\) and the rate \(\Phi\) we use the results of our measurements with ODYSSEUS which will be presented in chapter 6.

Figure 15 shows the rate dependence of the 3\(\sigma\)-efficiency.

Since the probability for a delta ray arriving earlier than the muon increases with the track radius, the 3\(\sigma\)-efficiency decreases from the wire to the wall. For an analogous reason the distance between two curves for different rates grows with increasing radius: The longer the drift time corresponding to the muon track, the bigger is the probability to have a

Figure 15: _(a) 3\(\sigma\)-efficiency as a function of the track radius for different gamma rates. For this plot the unipolar shaping with maximum undershoot was used. (b) 3\(\sigma\)-efficiency averaged over \(r\) as a function of the gamma rate for the three shaping schemes studied._

background hit before the muon hit. Delta rays alone bring the averaged \(3\sigma\)-efficiency below \(90\,\%\).

The dip near the wire is not due to delta rays but to the (in principle incorrect) gaussian treatment of the non-gaussian errors of the r-t relationship in this domain [11].

Taking the average \(3\sigma\)-efficiency over all radii \(r\) and plotting it versus the rate we obtain figure 15b. At the maximum ATLAS rate (safety factor 5 included) only \(80\,\%\) of the muon hits would be reconstructed within \(3\ \sigma\).

Note that unlike the hit efficiency, the \(3\sigma\)-efficiency doesn't depend on the shaping scheme. This is reasonable because background hits and delta rays mask signal hits whichever electronics we use.

The next chapter shows how double track separation can recover some of the shaded muon hits.

Double Track Separation with two Thresholds

The two-threshold technique for double track separation has already been studied in simulation [8]. The instrumentation in the X5 test beam now offered us the opportunity of applying the method to real data.

The principle of the method is shown in figure 16a, which shows muon pulses arriving very soon after a background pulse (from a gamma, delta ray or other muon). The muon pulse is undetected by the lower threshold if it arrives before the background pulse has decayed below that threshold. However, it can still be detected by a higher threshold as shown in figure 16a. If it is very close to the background pulse, it remains masked (figure 16b). At a high threshold of 100 electrons, a muon arriving 100 ns or more after the background pulse has a good chance to be detected. This corresponds to a two-track separation of 3 mm.

A drawback of the reconstruction with a high threshold is the worse resolution compared with the low threshold: The resolution is 170 \(\mu\)m at a threshold of 100 electrons instead of 85 \(\mu\)m at 25 electrons.

In addition, due to the finite rise time of the leading edge the crossing time of the high threshold is systematically shifted with respect to the low threshold crossing time. But this is no serious problem since we can correct for this systematic effect.

The residual plots in figure 17 illustrate the three mentioned problems: The gap in plot (a) results from the 100 ns minimum separation time. The projection in plot (b) shows the bad resolution and the systematic shift of the reconstructed muon hit radius.

Figure 16: _Double track separation with the two-threshold method. In example (a) the shaded muon pulse is reconstructed using the second crossing of the high threshold. Example pulse (b) cannot be separated because the separation time is shorter than the decay time of the gamma pulse._

Our readout concept in X5 (cf. section 2) allows us to do double track separation with two different sets of information:

* the TDC data: thresholds at \(25\,\mathrm{e}^{-}\) and \(100\,\mathrm{e}^{-}\).
* the FADC data: They offer the advantage of flexible thresholds (set by software in the analysis).

In both cases the unipolar shaping was used. ODYSSEUS served as an external tracker. Its information is first needed for determining the r-t relationship, then for the decision whether a hit is a background hit (i.e. whether it arrives more than 3 \(\sigma_{\mathrm{low\ threshold}}\) earlier than predicted) and finally for judging whether the reconstruction of a shaded muon was successful, i.e. whether

\[r_{\mu\,\mathrm{reconstructed}}-r_{\mu\,\mathrm{silicon\ telescope}}<3\,\sigma_{ \mathrm{high\ threshold}}(r) \tag{5}\]

To quantify the success of the separation technique we introduce the separation efficiency

\[\eta_{sep}=\frac{\mathrm{separated\ muons\ according\ to\ (\ref{eq:sod})}}{ \mathrm{all\ muons\ shaded\ by\ background\ hits}}\quad. \tag{6}\]

We studied double track separation for two kinds of background:

* only delta rays (no external background), see section 5.1.
* gamma background and delta rays, see section 5.2.

Figure 17: _Residuals for the second crossing of the 100 electron threshold. Here the background consists of delta rays only. In (a) the difference between the reconstructed hit radius and the track radius predicted by ODYSSEUS is plotted versus the predicted track radius. (b) is the projection of (a) onto the ordinate._

### Separation of Muons and Delta Rays

We first applied the two-threshold method to data taken without any external background in order to study the possibility of reconstructing muon hits which are shaded by delta rays.

In figure 18 the separation efficiency for a high threshold of 120 electrons is plotted as a function of the leading edge separation time obtained using the silicon telescope information:

\[\Delta t_{\text{leading edge}}=t_{\text{predicted by ODYSSEUS}}-t_{\text{ background(low threshold crossing)}} \tag{7}\]

As already mentioned above, for \(\Delta t\) smaller than about 100 ns the separation efficiency is bad because in most cases the background hit is not yet back under the high threshold.

The decrease of \(\eta\) at very big \(\Delta t\) is due to delta rays depositing more energy before the muon pulse. Thus the probability that the delta-ray signal has already decayed under the higher threshold diminishes.

Taking the mean over all \(\Delta t\) for different high thresholds, one obtains the solid curve with the square markers in figure 19. If the high threshold is increased, more background pulses decay below the high threshold before the muon pulse arrives, which improves the separation efficiency. Above 180 electrons though, the efficiency levels off as more and more muons simply do not reach that signal height.

Figure 18: _Double track separation efficiency for a pure delta-ray background as a function of the leading edge separation time. The high threshold was at 120 electrons._In ATLAS double track separation will suffer from the fact that the information from the high threshold will be combined (logical "OR") with a pulse from an ADC whose length corresponds to the leading edge charge (figure 20). Thus all pulses from the second TDC arriving during the ADC pulse will be swallowed by the latter. This implies a dead time for double track separation of up to 100 ns. Fortunately in most cases these 100 ns coincide with the time over threshold of the first pulse, i.e. the one hiding the muon. However, if this first pulse doesn't exceed the high threshold and the separation time is smaller than 100 ns, the muon is lost3. To take this electronic dead time into account in our data analysis, we rejected all crossings of the high threshold which occurred within 100 ns after the first low threshold crossing (= background hit). The resulting separation efficiency (represented by the dashed curve with the circular markers in figure 22) is a worst case estimate since 100 ns is the maximum dead time. For a threshold of 100 electrons the separation efficiency would be reduced from 54 % to 48 %. In ATLAS the separation efficiency will lie between the solid (no electronic dead time) and the dashed line.

Footnote 3: For further information about ATLAS front-end electronics issues see [8].

### Separation of Muons and a Combined Background of Gammas and Delta Rays

The data for studying the separation of muon and gamma hits were taken with a background rate of 1080 Hz/cm (source attenuation factor 1.6). Even at this high gamma background rate about 50 % of the total background are due to delta rays. Since this intrinsic background is unavoidable in real data, we cannot get a pure gamma background as in a simulation.

For the simulation signals from muons and photons were recorded with a FADC and superimposed in software (see [9]).

In figure 21a the measured and simulated separation efficiency for a high threshold of 120 electrons is plotted as a function of the leading edge separation time.

Figure 20: _Schematic drawing of the ATLAS front-end electronics and their functionality for double track separation. In normal mode one would read output (1) or (2) giving one hit per signal. In case of trouble with high occupancies one would read line (4) which is the logical “OR” of (2) and (3). The high threshold discriminator would have a fixed output pulse width of 10 - 20 ns (\(<\) ADC gate), so all pulses of line (3) arriving within the ADC pulse length would be swallowed._Despite the resemblance with the real data, reflecting the rather good description of the system by the simulation model, a quantitative comparison is difficult, because some conditions are different:

In the simulation delta rays are not taken into account. Including them into the model would deteriorate the simulated efficiency, because delta rays are more difficult to separate than uncorrelated gammas (see a few lines below). The plateau for \(\Delta t>100\,\mathrm{ns}\) would then be reduced from about \(70\,\mathrm{\char 37}\) to about \(60\,\mathrm{\char 37}\) which is lower than the measured level of about \(65\,\mathrm{\char 37}\).

The presence of delta rays in real data explains the deterioration of the separation efficiency for leading edge separation times greater than \(350\,\mathrm{ns}\) (see section 5.1) which is not seen in the simulation neglecting delta rays.

Figure 22 shows the mean separation efficiency as a function of the high threshold. As in figure 19 the solid line represents the efficiency without electronics dead time, whereas the dashed line stands for the worst case of \(100\,\mathrm{ns}\) dead time due to the ADC pulse. Again the separation efficiency improves with increasing threshold, but only up to about \(150\) electrons. Above that value hit inefficiencies for the muon pulses at the high threshold become important, leading to a decrease in separation efficiency. This effect starts earlier for photons than deltas (cf. figure 19) because of the lower energy deposit of the latter.

Generally the efficiency is higher than for a pure delta-ray background. The lower separation efficiency for delta-ray pulses can be explained with the strong correlation between a delta ray and the muon track: Delta-electrons have their origin on the muon track and, due to their low energy (typically some keV), they are strongly ionizing. Therefore a big amount of charge is deposited close to the muon track which makes the separation difficult.

Resolution

### Measurements

The resolution measurements were performed with Ar/N\({}_{2}\)/CH\({}_{4}\) 91/4/5 at a gas gain of \(G=2\cdot 10^{4}\) and a gas pressure of 3 bar. ODYSSEUS was used as external tracking reference (see section 2).

In the following one primary electron is defined as the pulse height corresponding to one primary ionization electron. The calibration of the effective discriminator threshold was done with a \({}^{241}\)Am source + Mo foil, producing one localized cluster of 670 ionization electrons.

#### 6.1.1 Contributions to Resolution Deterioration

Several effects contribute to the deterioration of the MDT resolution with background rate (see section 6.2.2). The following contributions were quantified separately:

* **Gain Drop:** 

The space charge building up in the drift region reduces

Figure 23: _Gain drop versus background rate for a gas gain of \(G_{0}=2\cdot 10^{4}\). The solid line is calculated using the model introduced in section 6.2.1._

wire and therefore lessens the gas gain. This effect can be predicted by the model introduced in section 6.2.1. Figure 23 shows the normalized average of the integrals of muon pulses as a function of background rate. This measurement was done using the FADC data.
* **Baseline shift and fluctuations:** See sections 3.3 and 3.4.

#### 6.1.2 Resolution as a Function of Rate

Figure 24 shows the deterioration of resolution with higher background rates for our three shaping schemes:

* Unipolar shaping: For this kind of shaping we can observe a fast deterioration of resolution with higher rates. This is due to the large baseline shift and fluctuations (see section 3.4).
* Unipolar shaping with undershoot: The baseline shift and the baseline fluctuations were kept at a minimum level. That's why this shaping shows the smallest deterioration of resolution with rate.
* Bipolar shaping: The bad resolution without background rate is due to the factor 1.3 higher noise level

Figure 24: _Resolution versus rate for different kinds of shaping. The radial average \(\bar{\sigma}\) of the resolution was calculated according to equation (9)._

and the factor 2 bigger peaking time \(t_{p}\) for this kind of shaping in our test setup. Another problem was, that the pulse heights after the bipolar shaping were a factor 4 smaller than after the unipolar shaping. Since the discriminators need a certain amount of charge to trigger a signal, this fact caused a time walk and hence worse resolution. This also explains the stronger resolution deterioration with rate than for the unipolar shaping with undershoot, because the gain drop boosted the time walk. With properly adjusted bipolar shaping we would expect a smaller deterioration with background rate than for the other shaping schemes since baseline shift and baseline fluctuations are suppressed (as shown in section 3.3).

A threshold of 25 primary electrons was used. For a detailed description of the different contributions to high rate resolution deterioration see section 6.2.2.

#### 6.1.3 Time Slewing Corrections

Because of charge fluctuations in the leading edge of the signal, the rise time of the signal varies. This results in fluctuations of the threshold crossing time and therefore in degraded resolution. Since the information about the time slewing is still contained in the signal rise time, corrections can be applied.

In [8], [9] two different methods of time slewing corrections are introduced. Those two methods are the second-threshold correction and the leading-edge charge correction (see figure 25).

Figure 25: _Time slewing corrections. (a) shows the second threshold correction: The time difference between the two threshold crossings supplies information about the slope of the leading edge. (b) shows the leading edge charge correction: The integral over a part of the leading edge contains the information about the slope of the leading edge._

1. Second threshold correction: Data were taken with two thresholds (\(25\,\mathrm{e}^{-}\) and \(100\,\mathrm{e}^{-}\)). In this method the noise causes a jitter on both threshold crossings (\(\sigma_{t}\)), consequently the difference between the two thresholds has an error of \(\sigma_{t}\sqrt{2}\).
2. Leading edge charge correction: This kind of time slewing correction is the baseline for the ATLAS MDT's. In our measurements the leading edge charge was calculated from the FADC data. The noise level only affects the threshold crossing: The noise averages out for the leading edge charge. This explains the better performance of this method.

In our study both methods for time slewing correction were tested using the unipolar shaping with undershoot.

In order to find the systematic deviations of the measured drift time from the ideal one, we determine the time residuals

\[\Delta t=t_{\mathrm{measured}}-t_{\mathrm{predicted\ by\ ODYSSEUS}} \tag{8}\]

as a function of the drift time and the threshold crossing time difference (method 1) or the leading edge charge (method 2). A 2-dimensional polynomial fit (\(2^{\mathrm{nd}}\) order in the drift time and \(4^{\mathrm{th}}\) order in the threshold difference or leading edge charge respectively) was then performed. Figure 26 shows these polynomials for different drift time slices (each \(100\,\mathrm{ns}\)).

The polynomials were afterwards used to determine the drift time corrections necessary for improving the resolution (figure 27).

Figure 26: _2-dimensional projection of the 3-dimensional polynomial fit (\(2^{\mathrm{nd}}\times 4^{\mathrm{th}}\) order) to the time residuals \(\Delta t\) defined in (8) for time slewing corrections. Plot (a) shows \(\Delta t\) for the second threshold correction, plot (b) for the leading edge charge correction. Since the leading edge becomes steeper for longer drift times, the projections become steeper in (a) and flatter in (b)._

The tube to which leading edge charge correction was applied had a higher noise level and hence worse resolution before the correction. Still, after correction both tubes have about the same resolution.

The average resolution over a tube is given by quadratically averaging the resolution as a function of \(r\). However, we are more interested in the resolution for a track fit. There hits are weighted by \(\frac{1}{\sigma(r)^{2}}\). Hence a better figure of merit for our purposes is \(\bar{\sigma}\) defined by (\(b\) is the inner tube radius and \(a\) is the wire radius):

\[\bar{\sigma}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\left\langle\frac{1}{\sigma^{2}}\right\rangle}} \qquad\mbox{with}\qquad\left\langle\frac{1}{\sigma^{2}}\right\rangle=\frac{1 }{b-a}\int\limits_{a}^{b}\frac{1}{\sigma^{2}(r)}\,dr\quad. \tag{9}\]

Thus we obtain:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c c c|c c|} \hline \multirow{2}{*}{correction} & \multicolumn{6}{c|}{\(\bar{\sigma}\) (all values in \(\mu\)m)} \\ \cline{2-6}  & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{without background rate} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{with background rate (333.5 kHz)} \\  & no corr. & corr. & improvement & no corr. & corr. & improvement \\ \hline second threshold & 92 & 80 & 45 & 100 & 87 & 49 \\ leading edge charge & 101 & 77 & 65 & 115 & 84 & 79 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The improvement in the table is calculated as the quadratic difference between the resolutions without and with correction. The table shows that the leading edge charge correction is more successful than the second threshold correction. The rate effect itself stays, but is slightly improved, because time slewing as a consequence of baseline shift and gain drop is reduced.

Figure 27: _Improvement of the resolution by time slewing corrections: (a) for the second threshold correction, (b) for the leading edge charge correction. Unfortunately the two starting points (i.e. the tube resolutions without any corrections) are not equal because tubes with different noise levels were used._

### Simulations

#### 6.2.1 Calculation of Field Change

The ion drift from the avalanche to the cathode takes several milliseconds. Their presence in the drift region creates a space charge which modifies the electric field for subsequent events. Since in our case the irradiated part of the tube is longer than the tube diameter we can approximate the space charge to be constant in the dimension along the wire and thus consider the problem to be 2-dimensional. There are certainly limitations to this model, since assuming a count rate of \(500\,\mathrm{Hz/cm^{2}}\) (that is \(1500\,\mathrm{Hz/cm}\) tube wire), together with a maximum ion drift time of \(4\,\mathrm{ms}\) there are on average only the ions of 6 events drifting in a \(1\,\mathrm{cm}\) slice of the tube. Hence a 2-dimensional approximation might be at the limit of validity. The comparison of the simulations and the measurements, however, shows good agreement.

1. **Exact Calculation:** The ion velocity depends on the electric field according to \[v=\mu(E)\,E\] (10) Apart from the high-field region very close to the wire the ion mobility \(\mu\) can be considered as constant. The density of space charge in the MDT can be calculated in the following way: \[\frac{dr}{dt}=\mu E(r)\qquad\rightarrow\qquad dt=\frac{dr}{\mu E(r)},\] (11) where \(dt\) is the time it takes an ion to get from \(r\) to \(r+dr\). Multiplying \(dt\) by the amount of charge that is produced in the avalanche per second and dividing by the area between \(r\) and \(r+dr\) yields the charge density \[\rho(r)=\frac{N_{c}GQ}{2r\pi\mu E(r)}\] (12) where \(N_{c}\) is the count rate per unit of length along the tube, \(Q\) is the average charge deposit per background event and \(G\) is the gas gain. In equation (12) it has been assumed that the charge is equally distributed around the wire (no \(\phi\,\)-dependence). This is not the case for most of the events, but still it is a quite good approximation. Using Gauss' theorem we obtain: \[\oint\vec{E}\,d\vec{S}=q\] (13) where \(q\) is the total charge enclosed by the cylinder surface \(S\). Evaluation of both sides and simplification yields the following expression: \[2\pi rE(r)=\frac{\gamma}{\varepsilon_{0}}+\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{0}}\int\limits _{a}^{r}2\pi r^{\prime}\rho(r^{\prime})\,dr^{\prime}\quad,\] (14)where \(\gamma\) is the line charge on the anode wire. Differentiation on both sides gives the differential equation

\[E(r)^{2}+rE(r)\frac{dE(r)}{dr}=c_{1}\qquad\mbox{with}\qquad c_{1}=\frac{N_{c}GQ}{ 2\pi\mu\varepsilon_{0}} \tag{15}\]

with the solution

\[E(r)=\sqrt{c_{1}}\,\frac{k}{r}\,\sqrt{1+\frac{r^{2}}{k^{2}}} \tag{16}\]

where the integration constant \(k\) is determined by the boundary conditions. Since \(E(r)\) has to obey the constraint

\[\int\limits_{a}^{b}E(r)\,dr=V_{0} \tag{17}\]

we obtain a transcendental equation for the parameter \(k\):

\[k\log\frac{b(k^{2}+k\sqrt{k^{2}+a^{2}})}{a(k^{2}+k\sqrt{k^{2}+b^{2}})}+\sqrt{k ^{2}+b^{2}}-\sqrt{k^{2}+a^{2}}=V_{0}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi\mu\varepsilon_{0}}{N_{c}GQ}} \tag{18}\]

This equation can be solved numerically. The parameter \(k\) has the dimension of a length and tells us a lot about the strength of the space charge effect. For \(k\gg b\) for example we can neglect the second term in the square root in equation (16), and the \(1/r\) dependence of the drift field without space charge is restored.

In order to take into account the gain drop one has to calculate the line charge \(\gamma\) on the wire, which is given by

\[\gamma=2\pi\varepsilon_{0}aE(a)\quad, \tag{19}\]

and to insert it into Diethorn's formula [12] describing the gas gain \(G\) as a function of \(\gamma\):

\[G=\left[\frac{\gamma}{2\pi\varepsilon_{0}aE_{min}(\rho_{0})\frac{\rho_{gas}} {\rho_{0}}}\right]^{\frac{\gamma\log 2}{2\pi\varepsilon_{0}a\Delta V}} \tag{20}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline gas mixture & \(E_{min}(1\,\mbox{bar})\) & \(\Delta V\) \\  & (kV/cm) & (V) \\ \hline Ar/N\({}_{2}\)/CH\({}_{4}\) 91/4/5 & 21 & 44 \\ Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) 80/20 & 22 & 49 \\ Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) 90/10 & 20 & 43 \\ Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) 92/8 & 19 & 42 \\ Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) 93/7 & 24 & 34 \\ Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) 94/6 & 23 & 34 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: _Diethorn parameters \(E_{min}\) and \(\Delta V\) for different gas mixtures. The errors are about 10 %. The values for Ar/N\({}_{2}\)/CH\({}_{4}\) 91/4/5 are taken from [13],[14], the others are from our own measurements._\(E_{min}(\rho_{0})\) and \(\Delta V\) are two gas-dependent parameters, \(\rho_{gas}\) is the gas density. The values of \(E_{min}\) and \(\Delta V\) for several gas mixtures are listed in table 1.

Since a different gas gain will produce a different amount of space charge, change the electrical field on the wire surface and consequently the gas gain, we have to iterate the two formulas (16) and (20). Usually they converge after only a few steps.

Figure 28 shows the results obtained for \(k\), \(\sqrt{c_{1}}\) and \(G/G_{0}\) as a function of rate. Equation (16) yields the electric field which was used for the simulations in section 6.2.2.

Figure 28: _Field parameters. These plots show the dependence of the different field parameters on the rate per unit wire length. The parameters are calculated with the method described before. Plot (a) shows the parameter \(k\). For high rates \(k\) becomes smaller until \(k\approx b\). Plot (b) shows the parameter \(\sqrt{c_{1}}\) and (c) the gain drop. All calculations are done for Ar/N\({}_{2}\)/CH\({}_{4}\) 91/4/5, but the values are gas independent within a few per cent. The assumed energy deposit per background event was 36 keV._

2. **A First Order Approximation:** If \(r\ll k\), which also means \(k\gg b\) (\(b=1.46\,\)cm) we can expand equations (16) and (18), and the two expressions reduce to \[E(r)\approx\sqrt{c_{1}}\frac{k}{r}+\sqrt{c_{1}}\frac{r}{2k}\qquad\text{and} \qquad k\log\frac{b}{a}+\frac{b^{2}}{4k}=\frac{V_{0}}{\sqrt{c_{1}}}\] (21) Solving for \(k\) gives the field \[E(r)=\frac{V_{0}}{r\log\frac{b}{a}}\left(1-\frac{b^{2}N_{c}GQ\log\frac{b}{a}}{8 \pi\epsilon_{0}\mu V_{0}^{2}}\right)+\frac{N_{c}GQ\log\frac{b}{a}}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}\mu V_{0}}\,r\] (22) This approximation is not valid (error \(\mathcal{O}[25\,\%]\) at \(1500\,\)Hz/cm) at the highest rates considered here. The first order approximation overestimates the rate effect at high rates, especially for high radii.

#### 6.2.2 Contributions to Resolution Deterioration

The drift tube response to charged particle tracks was simulated using GARFIELD [1], a drift chamber simulation program, MAGBOLTZ [15], a program to calculate transport properties of gas mixtures, and HEED [16], a program calculating the energy deposit of fast particles in gases. MAGBOLTZ and HEED are interfaced to GARFIELD.

The simulations were done in order to get a better understanding of the different contributions to resolution deterioration at high background rates. For the simulations four effects were taken into account:

1. **Electronics effects:** The two electronics effects depend on the total background rate per tube (not per unit length) since for the readout all background pulses are relevant, no matter where along the tube they have been produced. The highest expected background rate per tube for the worst MDT in ATLAS including a safety factor 5 is \(300\,\)kHz. In the final ATLAS electronics the electronics effects will be kept at a minimum level (active baseline restoration). For this measurement in the test beam electronics without baseline restoration have been used. * Baseline shift: As shown in section 3.3 the baseline is shifted at high count rates per tube. This has the same effect as triggering on a higher primary electron. Hence the resolution deteriorates [8],[9] because of bigger time slewing4. In the simulations the baseline shift was introduced as a higher threshold, the exact values for the shift were taken from the FADC data (see figure 12).

* Baseline fluctuations: The baseline fluctuations for different kinds of shaping were discussed in section 3.4. Baseline fluctuations cause a jitter on the threshold crossing time because of the finite slope of the leading edge of the signal (see figure 29). Hence the resolution deteriorates. The fluctuations of the baseline were simulated as a varying threshold (Gaussian distributed) with a \(\sigma\) obtained from the FADC data.

2. **Space charge effects:** There are two effects which depend on the rate per wire length (the highest expected local background rate for the worst MDT in ATLAS including a safety factor 5 is 1500 Hz/cm). Since these effects come from space charge produced by ions drifting to the cathode, they depend on the drift gas and on the gas gain. * Gain drop: A calculation of the gain drop was presented in section 6.2.1, and our measurements were shown in section 6.1.1. Its impact on the resolution can be understood as scaling down the signals whereas the threshold stays fixed. Consequently the threshold gets effectively shifted to higher primary electrons and this causes bigger time slewing. In the simulations the calculations of the gain drop have been used (see figure 23). * Field variations: A constant background rate changes the drift field and consequently the r-t relationship (see figure 30). The drift field for the ionization electrons is only influenced by drifting ion clouds in a slice of approximately 1 cm of the tube. In such a slice there are only about 6 ion clouds drifting at the same time (at 1500 Hz/cm). Since this number of ion clouds is Poisson-distributed, the drift field varies and the resolution deteriorates. This effect is rather small for a linear gas such as Ar/N\({}_{2}\)/CH\({}_{4}\) 91/4/5, but can become the dominating effect for non-linear gas mixtures like Ar/CO\({}_{2}\).

Figure 29: _Effects of the baseline fluctuation. Sketch (a) shows the resolution deterioration. A fluctuating baseline causes a jitter on the threshold crossing times (t\({}_{1}\) – t\({}_{2}\)) because of the finite signal rise time (due to the limited bandwidth of the preamplifier + shaper)._

In figure 31 one can see the good agreement between the simulations and the measurements. Data from two different test beams and with different gas mixtures were compared to the simulations.

Figure 32 shows the GARFIELD [1] simulations, switching on one single effect at a time and comparing to the resolution without background rate (quadratic difference).

Based on these results the following comments can be made:

* The contribution of the field fluctuations is rather small for this linear gas (figure 32). Since the drift velocity is constant over big drift distances, variations of the drift field translate only into small variations of the drift time. For non-linear gas mixtures like Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) 93/7 this contribution dominates.
* The baseline shift (9 primary ionization electrons) dominates the resolution deterioration of the linear gas. It shifts the threshold to higher electrons (\(25\,\mathrm{e}^{-}\to 34\,\mathrm{e}^{-}\)). The contribution of the gain drop (\(G/G_{0}=0.87\)) is smaller over the whole drift distance since the effective threshold shifts only to \(25\,\mathrm{e}^{-}\cdot G_{0}/G=28.5\,\mathrm{e}^{-}\). With a linear gas the pulse height increases with the radius5 and hence the leading edge becomes steeper. Therefore raising the threshold affects the resolution less at bigger radii, hence both effects decrease with bigger drift distance \(r\). Footnote 5: In a linear gas the time difference between individual clusters of ionization electrons arriving at the wire becomes smaller with bigger distance of the track from the wire, consequently the pulse heights increase.
* The baseline fluctuations in figure 32 deteriorate the resolution slightly (see figure 29) since the threshold was kept at the \(25^{\mathrm{th}}\) primary ionization electron (\(5\times\sigma_{\mathrm{noise}}\)).

Figure 30: _The plot on the left side shows the drift field change because of space charge. On the right side the big impact on the r-\(t\) relationship of a non-linear gas is demonstrated. For a linear gas the effect is much smaller because the drift velocity is less dependent on the field._

Raising the threshold to \(5\times\sigma_{\rm noise+fluct}\) would result in a resolution deterioration comparable to the contribution of the gain drop.
* The difference between "all effects on" and the quadratic sum of all effects in figure 32 shows that there is a correlation between individual contributions. The quadratic sum underestimates the resolution deterioration because a baseline shift amplifies the effect of the gain drop: The baseline shift shifts the threshold from the \(25^{\rm th}\) to the \(34^{\rm th}\) primary ionization electron. Multiplying this with \(G_{0}/G\) yields a threshold of \(39\,{\rm e}^{-}\) which is higher than we obtain by summing up the two individual effects6. Footnote 6: In this threshold region the resolution degrades linearly with higher thresholds.

Figure 31: _Comparison of measurements and GARFIELD [1] simulations. For the linear ’DATCHA gas’ (a) the rate effects are much smaller, all 4 effects were switched on. For the non-linear Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) mixture (b) the rate on the tube was small (local irradiation), therefore only the space charge effects contributed to the resolution deterioration. For the non-linear gas the field fluctuations dominate the resolution deterioration. Note that despite the dramatic deterioration in resolution for Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) with rate, the overall resolution is still as good as for the linear gas, because the non-linear gas starts off so much better._

Figure 32: _Contributions to resolution deterioration. The background rate is 1850 Hz/cm, the drift gas is Ar/N\({}_{2}\)/CH\({}_{4}\) 91/4/5, the gas gain is G = 2 \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{4}\). This plot shows the quadratic differences between the resolution curve including one rate effect and the resolution curve without background rate. The curve for “all effects on” displays the quadratic difference between the two simulated curves in figure 31. The negative contribution of baseline fluctuations is explained in the text._

Conclusion

In this note we have shown that MDT's can cope with the expected ATLAS background rates and still fulfil the requirements. However, their behaviour depends on the pulse shaping. Without any baseline restoration in the front-end electronics (i.e. in the case of unipolar shaping) the baseline is shifted by the equivalent of about \(-9\) electrons at the maximum ATLAS rate and shows fluctuations of about 5 electrons. The consequence is a time jitter on the leading edges of the signal pulses, which for linear gases contributes strongly to resolution deterioration. By introducing big signal undershoots the baseline can be stabilized and the resolution improved.

Resolution is also affected by space charge causing gain drop (\(\rightarrow\) time slewing) and field variations (\(\rightarrow\) fluctuations of the r-t relationship). Simulation showed that the latter effect is dominant for non-linear gas mixtures like Ar/CO\({}_{2}\). Hence, beside the electronics design, the gas choice has a big impact on the high rate performance.

The information from a second threshold (100 electrons) or a leading-edge charge measurement can be used to correct for time slewing resulting in a quadratic resolution improvement of about 50 \(\mu\)m in the former case and 60-80 \(\mu\)m in the latter case.

As expected the hit efficiency doesn't suffer significantly from high background rates. The \(3\sigma\)-efficiency however decreases from 90 % without rate to 80 % at the maximum ATLAS rate. This performance degradation is due to gammas shading the muon pulses. With a second discriminator threshold at about 100 electrons we can separate about 50 % of the shaded muons from the preceding background pulses.

The comparison of measurements and simulations shows a very good agreement.
