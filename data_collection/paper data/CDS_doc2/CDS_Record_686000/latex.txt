Introduction

At the LHC, the straw tubes of the ATLAS Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) will be continuously irradiated by charged particles, neutrons and photons. The neutron background comes from hadronic showers in the calorimeter and constitutes the main source of the photon background itself.

In a previous measurement [1] a few straws embedded in a polyethylene foam were exposed to a neutron source and their efficiency for registrating hits from low energy neutrons was measured. The extrapolation of these data to the neutron fluence expected at LHC led to estimated straw counting rates from neutrons at least one order of magnitude below that expected from charged particles. However, the experimental conditions in the measurement were not the same as expected in the ATLAS Inner Detector for two main reasons:

* the dominant condition to the straw counting rate from neutrons arises from low energy photons: the spectrum of these photons depends strongly on the materials surrounding the TRT and could not therefore be reproduced accurately in the measurements reported in [1], although the neutron source energy spectrum was very similar to the expected neutron energy spectrum in the inner detector at LHC.
* the measurements of [1] were not performed in a magnetic field and set-up was too small to represent the real part of the TRT.

The impact of neutrons on the TRT performance can be separated into the different components:

* ageing of materials under neutron irradiation;
* sensitivity of straws to recoil nuclei;
* sensitivity of straws to photons of energies between 1 keV and 10 MeV, produced by neutrons through inelastic scattering or capture reactions in the surrounding material.

The first component is important for the choice of materials in the final detector design, but does not affect the straw counting rate.

Recoil nuclei originate mainly from fast neutrons. The neutron energy spectrum depends upon the detailed configuration of the inner detector and its surroundings, in particular on the quantity of moderating materials such as hydrocarbons, which are present in the TRT radiators and the moderator placed in front of the endcap calorimeter. These moderating materials shift the neutron energy spectrum towards the thermal region, as shown in [2] for ATLAS. The overall equivalent 1 MeV neutron fluence in the Inner Detector is about \(10^{13}\,cm^{-1}y\,ear^{-1}\). This corresponds to a rate of 20 MHz of fast neutrons per 50 cm long straw, which can produce recoil nuclei in the hydrogen of the straw walls and the TRT radiator. From neutron elastic cross-section data [3], the straw counting rate from recoil protons produced at distances less then their penetration depth (2 mg/cm\({}^{2}\) and 13 mg/cm\({}^{2}\) for 1 and 3 MeV proton energies correspondly) can be estimated reasonably accurately. In the absence of magnetic field, this counting rate is estimated to be a few kHz and should be even less in the ATLAS solenoidal magnetic field of 2T. This estimate was conformed by the measurements reported in [1]. These protons are heavy ionising particles and produce self-limited streamer discharges in the straw gas, but the rate of such discharges will be much smaller than that caused by minimum ionising particles, which is estimated to be about 10 kHz as discussed in Section 5.

Thermal neutrons, on the other hand, participate only in inelastic scattering and capture reactions, and produce mainly a large low-energy photon flux, which turn out to be the dominant source of straw counting rate due to neutrons. Therefore, it is necessary to measure the straw response to low energy photons, in order to combine this measured response with the produced photon energy spectrum and to predict the straw counting rate from neutron-induced background.

## 2 Photon background at LHC

As mentioned above the photon energy spectrum is very sensitive to the exact composition surrounding materials. Therefore, until the final detector is built it is quite difficult to make precise predictions, even if neutron cross-sections are usually well known.

The photon energy spectrum in the Inner Detector have been estimated in detail for the ATLAS Technical Proposal [2] (see page 182). According to the authors, the uncertainties in these simulations are about factor of two. Fig. 1 shows the map of the yearly integrated photon fluence (E\(>\)30 keV) in the ATLAS inner detector and calorimeter system. One can see that the hardest conditions are for the endcap TRT, where the last straw layers will operate in the presence of photon fluence of up to \(10^{14}\,cm^{-2}yr^{-1}\).

The energy spectrum for photons in the middle of the endcap TRT (dashed line in Fig. 1) is shown in Fig. 2. The broad shoulder at energies above 10 MeV comes from \(\pi^{0}\) decays, generated in the primary pp collisions. The impact of these photons on the straw counting rate is taken into account in the standard straw occupancy simulations using minimum bias events. The lower part of the energy spectrum (below 10 MeV) comes from neutron interactions. Using these predictions one can estimate the rates of photons crossing the straws in the barrel and the endcap parts of the TRT, as shown in Table 1.

These very large rates (up to 160 MHz!) of photons crossing the straws have now to be transformed into counting rates. These counting rates will depend, not only on the working gas mixture, but also on the material distribution around the straws. For relatively high photon, scattered electronsFigure 1: Yearly integrated photon (E\(>\)30 keV) fluence (\(cm^{-2}\)) in the ATLAS Inner Detector and the calorimeter system [2].

have quite large range. For example, an electron of 1 MeV energy has range of about 6 cm in the TRT. This means that straws will may register hits originating from electrons born far away from the actual straw position. On the other side, a 1 MeV electron in a magnetic field of 2 T has a curvature radius of 1.5 mm. Thus, the straw counting rate will depend on the presence of the magnetic field and on its orientation with respect to the straw axis.

For all these reasons it was felt necessary to perform measurements in conditions as close as possible to the ones foreseen at LHC.

## 3 Experimental setup

### TRT prototype

One block of the 1992 TRT prototype was taken for these studies. The straws are embedded in polyethylene foam radiator of density about 0.06 g/cm\({}^{3}\), very similar to the one which will be finally chosen for ATLAS. The block contains 24 rows of straws with, 8 mm distance between rows and between straws within a row. The total number of straws in the prototype is 288. The straws are 44 cm long and 4 mm in diameter. A schematic view of the prototype is shown in Fig. 3. 50 straws at the centre of the prototype were connected to a gas supply and a few of these were connected to the electronics. The amplifier-shaper used in these measurements had the same output signal parameters as for the future LHC electronics. The straws have a **30**\(\mu\)**m** diameter wire and the nominal gas mixture of **70%Xe+20%CF\({}_{4}\)+10%CO\({}_{2}\)** was used. The gas gain was varied from \(1\cdot 10^{4}\) to \(4\cdot 10^{4}\) to emulate change of the electronics

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline TRT part & Yearly integrated & Photon rate \\  & photon fluence, & through the straw \\  & (\(cm^{-2}\)), & (MHz) \\ \hline Barrel (R=108 cm) & 2.5\(\cdot\)10\({}^{13}\) & 75 \\ \hline Barrel (R=64 cm) & 3.5\(\cdot\)10\({}^{13}\) & 105 \\ \hline Average in endcap & 4\(\cdot\)10\({}^{13}\) & 64 \\ for 40 cm long straws & & \\ \hline Maximum in endcap & 8\(\cdot\)10\({}^{13}\) & 160 \\ for 50 cm long straws & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

readout threshold.

Point-like gamma-ray sources of different energies were placed on one side of the prototype at a distance of 9.5 cm from the straws under investigation. Copper and aluminium filters Cu and Al filters of 300 \(\mu\)m and 500 \(\mu\)m respective thickness were positioned between the source and the prototype, as shown in Fig.3, in order to absorb the lowest-energy X-rays from sources. The whole set-up was situated inside the large dipole magnet in the H8 beam. The magnetic field was varied between 0 and its maximum value of 1.57 T. And measurements were performed with the straws oriented in different ways with respect to the magnetic field.

### Measurement method

The measurement method is shown schematically in Fig. 4.

The signals from three straws after amplification and shaping are split and

sent to discriminators, which have low-level threshold of 300 eV and a high level threshold of 6 keV ( for the nominal \(2.5\cdot 10^{4}\) gas gain). Large amplitudes (such as streamers) were also recorded and the threshold for these was set to 60 keV. After the discriminators, the signals are gated and counted over 100s in a scaler. The gate was used to protect the straws against occasional pick-up noise in the experimental hall. One additional amplifier/shaper with a small antenna was used for this purpose. The gas gain was controlled through the use of a special straw continuously irradiated by a \({}^{55}\)Fe-source.

### Comparison with LHC geometry

The straw counting rate depends on the incident photon angular distribution.

As shown in Fig. 5, the photon angular distribution follows a cosine low for an isotropic point-like source, as in the measurements reported here, but also for an isotropic photon fluence as expected for the ATLAS Inner Detector during LHC operation. Due to the finite length of the straws used in the measurements only 92% of the solid angle was covered since the total solid angle of the straw, as seen by the source is:

\[\delta\Omega=\frac{4Rdsin\alpha_{0}}{4\pi d^{2}}=\frac{0.92R}{\pi d}=0.0061, \tag{1}\]

Figure 5: Comparison of the photon response measurement geometry with LHC geometry

where R is the straw radius, d - straw-source distance, \(\alpha\) is the incident photon angle and \(\alpha_{0}\) is the maximum incident photon angle

The straw response to photons with incident angles \(\alpha\) large than \(\alpha_{0}=66^{o}\) was therefore not measured and this should be included in the overall uncertainty when extrapolating to the LHC case.

In the measurements reported here, the straw hit probability per crossing the straw was estimated as:

\[\epsilon=\frac{N_{count}}{A_{\it source}\cdot 0.0061}, \tag{2}\]

where \(N_{count}\) is the measured straw counting rate and \(A_{\it source}\) is the source activity.

### Photon sources

The various photon sources used in the measurements are described in Table 2. The highest photon energy available was 1.836 MeV (\({}^{88}\)Y-source) and the lowest one was 0.122 MeV (\({}^{5}\)Y-source). The latter was limited by the low energy source properties: such sources always display many different low energy characteristic lines which bring large uncertainties to the measurements. All these sources were prepared and certified the CERN Radioprotection Service.

Table 3 shows some of the typical straw counting rates obtained from sources, as compared to the background counting rate for thresholds of 200

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Source & Decay time & Photon energy (MeV) & Activity (kHz) \\ \hline \({}^{5}\)\({}^{7}\)Co & 271 days & 0.1 22 & 78 2 \\  & & 0.1 36 & 97 \\ \hline \({}^{113}\)Sn & 115 days & 0.3 91 & 371 \\ \hline \({}^{137}\)Cs & 30 years & 0.6 62 & 31 4 \\ \hline \({}^{65}\)Zn & 243 days & 1.1 15 & 277 \\ \hline \({}^{22}\)Na & 2.6 years &.511 & 38 3 \\  & & 1.2 74 & 21 3 \\ \hline \({}^{88}\)Y & 108 days & 0.8 98 & 190 \\  & & 1.8 36 & 20 8 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: **Photon sources used**eV and 6 keV. With the help of the gated scaler, the background counting rates were limited to a few Hz at the lowest threshold of 200 eV and a small fraction of a Hz for the high threshold of 6 keV. The resulting uncertainty on the measurement results was therefore estimated to be much less then 10%.

## 4 Results of the measurements

Straw hit probability in the case without magnetic field is shown in Fig.6 for various photon energies as a function of low-level threshold. Efficiency at the threshold of 200 eV was taken as 100% (it is

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Threshold & Counting rate from background & Counting rate from sources \\  & & (depends on source and photon energy) \\ \hline

6 keV & 0.1-0.2 Hz & 1-2 Hz \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: **Straw counting rates from low-energy photons**minimum ionising particles). For the comparison the same dependence for the source of electrons with mean electron energy of 0.6 MeV (\({}^{90}\)Sr-source) is also shown. Observed dE/dx spectrum from photons is softer then that from minimum ionising particles. The magnetic field does not essentially affect on this dependence.

The corresponding hit probabilities for the high-level threshold are shown in Fig.7. As the photon energy decreases, the high-energy tail from scattered electrons in the dE/dx distribution can be seen to increase substantially.

The results of the measurements with a magnetic field of 1.67 T as a function of the straw orientation with respect to the magnetic field are given in Figs. 8 and 9. In this case the straw counting rates normalised to the rate of photons crossing the straws.

For the low-level threshold of 200 eV, the probability for direct photon interactions in the straw working gas is also shown. One can see that the total straw counting rate is much higher than that expected from direct interactions in the straw gas mixture. The straw counting rate has a minimum

Figure 8: Straw hit probability as a function of photon energy for low-level threshold.

for photon energies of about 400 keV. This minimum is due to the competition between the decrease of the photon cross-section with the photon energy and the corresponding increase in the electron range, which results in largest numbers of electrons originating from outside the straw but nevertheless producing signals in the straw. For electron energies as low as 122 keV, the straw is nevertheless sensitive to electrons originating 2 mm away from the straw wall. In the 1.57 T transverse magnetic field, electrons of this energy have a radius of curvature of about 0.2 mm, and record hits only if originating very near the straw wall. For this reason, even for energies as low as 122 kev, the straw hit probability shown in Fig.8 is a factor of three higher than that expected from the photon cross-section in the gas.

For photon energies below 400 keV, the straw hit probabilities are independent of the magnetic field. But for photon energies above 400 keV, the presence of the magnetic field reduces the straw hit probability significantly. In case of straws oriented parallel to the magnetic field (as in the barrel TRT), the hit probability does not increase much for photon energies beyond about 1.2 Mev. For the highest photon energy of 1.83 MeV, the hit probability is in this case about a factor of two lower than in the absence of magnetic field. For straws oriented perpendicular to the magnetic field (as in endcap TRT), the hit probability is slightly higher, but still about a factor of 1.8 below the one without magnetic field.

For the high-level threshold of 6.5 keV, the situation is very different as shown in Fig. 9. Because the electrons produced through photon interactions spiral in the straw gas, the fraction of cases with large energy depositions increases in the presence of a magnetic field. This effect due-to spiralling electrons becomes very large for the high amplitudes (or streamers) measured with a threshold of 60 keV, as illustrated in Fig. 10 for the two orientations of the straws with respect to magnetic field. In fact, the straw hit probability for this very high threshold is the same for straws perpendicular to the magnetic field and for straws without magnetic field, and simply corresponds to the self-limited streamer discharge probability. In the case of straws oriented parallel to the magnetic field however, Fig. 10 shows that the hit probability becomes an order of magnitude higher, and is then dominated by large signals from spiralling electrons unable to escape from the straw gas.

## 5 Total straw counting rate at LHC

From the measurements described above, one can estimate the expected straw counting rates from the photon background at LHC at a luminosity of \(10^{34}cm^{-2}sec-1\). This rate R is estimated in the following way:

\[RATE\,=8\cdot 10^{8}\,S_{straw}\int_{0.03}^{10}\epsilon(E)\Phi(E)dE \tag{3}\]Figure 9: Straw hit probability as a function of photon energy for high level threshold.

Figure 10: Straw hit probability as a function of photon energy for the case of very large amplitudes

Where \(S_{straw}\) is the active area for the straw, \(\epsilon\)(E) is the straw hit probability for a photon of energy E (in MeV), as obtained from Figs. 8 to 10, and \(\Phi\)(E) is the photon fluence taken from Fig. 2.

The measurements do not, however, cover the entire photon energy range of relevance. For energies above 2 MeV, a linear extrapolation of the data shown in Figs. 8 to 10 was used, since the straw hit rate probability does not vary much in this energy range. For energies below 100 keV, the counting rate was estimated directly from the Xe cross-section data, a valid procedure given that, for example the range for electrons of 60 keV is about 5 mg/cm\({}^{2}\), i,e, a distance less than half of the straw wall thickness, and that the rate of interactions in the straw walls is only 20% of that of interactions in the straw gas.

Table 4 shows the results from these calculations applied to the barrel and endcap TRT, as a function of the straw position in the Inner Detector. For comparison, Table 5 shows the expected straw counting rate from particles produced in the primary collisions. From the Tables, one can conclude that in the case of the low-level threshold the photon background counting rate is never more than 15% of the counting rate expected from the primary collisions.

In the case of the high-level threshold, this fractional contribution increases to 20-60%, but for this threshold the straw counting rate is only about 1-3% of the interaction rate. Finally, the the spiralling of soft electrons in the magnetic field significantly increases the expected counting rate for streamers and very large signals in the barrel TRT, but the total rate remains very low (below 0.05% of the interaction rate) and the impact of this effect on the TRT performance is negligible

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & 200 eV & 6.5 keV & Streamers + large amplitude \\  & threshold & threshold & signals \\ \hline Barrel (R=108 cm) & 0.79 MHz & 155 kHz & 8.5 kHz \\ \hline Barrel (R=64 cm) & 1.1 MHz & 218 kHz & 12 kHz \\ \hline Average in endcap & 0.74 MHz & 135 kHz & \(<\) 1 kHz \\ for 40 cm long straws & & & \\ \hline Maximum in endcap & 1.85 MHz & 337 kHz & \(<\) 1 kHz \\ for 50 cm long straws & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 6 Conclusions

A detailed analysis of neutron background on the ATLAS Inner Detector shows that the main background source arises from photons produced in neutron capture and inelastic scattering processes. Detailed simulations performed using FLUKA [2] have produced the expected photon fluences and energy spectra in the ATLAS Inner Detector with an overall uncertainties of about a factor 2. Measurements such as those performed in [1] are certainly the best way to obtain complete and direct estimates of the straw counting rate at LHC. But additional uncertainty arises in this case, namely that the neutron and photon spectra are very sensitive to the real composition and distribution of the various materials in the detector. Finally, the best method has turned out to be that combining measurements of the straw response to low energy photons with detailed prediction of the photon energy spectrum and fluence in the ATLAS Inner Detector cavity.
