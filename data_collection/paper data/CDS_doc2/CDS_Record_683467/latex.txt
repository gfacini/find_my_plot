**Abstract**

A two dimensional analysis has been carried out to simulate the mechanical behaviour of the barrel part of the ATLAS tile hadronic calorimeter. Different cases have been studied and it turns out that the calorimeter is a very stiff structure which will deform less than half a millimeter in the vertical direction under gravitational load.

## 1 Introduction

The present mechanical design of the ATLAS tile hadron calorimeter is a low carbon steel structure consisiting of 64 modules (Fig. 1). Its outer diameter is 8400mm and the inner diameter is 4500mm. It is divided into a 5900mm long barrel and two 2650mm long endcap parts.

Here, only the barrel part is treated.

A module mainly consists of two parts, the active or sensible detector and the mechanical structure in form of a double I - beam.

The sensibel part is built up of 325 sandwiched periods of 5mm and 4mm steel plates (Fig. 2). At the moment it is not yet decided if the double I - beam will be a cast or welded structure. Details about the tile hadronic calorimeter can be read in the corresponding ATLAS reports.

The aim of the FE analysis was to give first hints about the reliability of the whole design and optimize it where possible. Different cases have been studied, so for example the worst case that the I - beam structure has to take all stresses resulting from the forces and momenti of the different modules. In the second calculation the modules have been connected at one node at the inner radius. The third case was an open structure that modelled the piling up of the ring. Before putting the last module you already have accumulated deformations. This case gives stresses and deformations for the moment before closing the ring.

The calculations have been carried out with CASTEM 2000 on PARC. The meshing consists of 7936 elements and 11072 nodes. This signified the limit of the virtual memory foreseen in CASTEM 2000. Therefore the mesh of the model couldn't take into account all details. This has as consequence that the stresses have an uncertainty of approximately 50% whereas the global deformation should be exact to 10 to 15%.

Being an initial calculation to define main guidelines of the design and check mechanical reliability no friction has been considered.

## 2 Baselines of the analysis

The sensible part of the detector consists of a glued stack of steel master plates, distance steel pieces and the plastic tiles in between. As, by evidence the whole bloc works under tension or compression, the glue has not been considered for the global model. The tiles make 25% of the volume and this has been taken into account for the Young's modulus and the density. Therefore the stresses in the steel of the sensible part has to be amplified by a factor of 4/3. The meshing used for sensible part and supporting double I-beams is shown in figure 3. It has not to confounded with a technical drawing because only the "working"parts of the structure are modelled.

Due to a lack of virtual memory the meshing had to be reduced more and more so that the batchjob doesn't crash anymore. Furthermore possible friction between the modules as well as any inner detector have not been considered.

The main impact concerning the inner detectors will come from the also quite heavy electromagnetic calorimeter. It probably will roll on rails on the horizontal midplane of the detector. There will be the need to sacrify some space to install correctly these rails. Enough clearance between electromagnetic and hadronic calorimter, including fabrication tolerances, deformation and cabling is necessary.

Further, more detailed calculation are only useful when these parameters are decided!

## 3 Results

Three cases have been studied at the moment:

- case I, were the supporting ring structure takes the forces alone

- case II, realistic calculation with connection at one node at inner radius

- case III, same as II but open ring (f. ex. during installation)

### Case I

This case showed that the support-structure doesn't withstand alone the weight of the calorimeter. The stresses go up to nearly 800 N/mm\({}^{\uplambda}\)2. Too much for low carbon steel. Figure 4 nicely indicates where the ring dowork under compression and tension. The ring has a tendancy to open at the support points and on top of the structure.

### Case II

This calculation was carried out by connecting the most inner nodes of the modules. It turns out that the hadronic calorimter is a stiff structure. The stresses around the supports have maxima of 22 N/mm\({}^{\wedge}\)2 and the deformations are nearly negligible for this big construction. In the horizontal plane the displacement is of 0.13mm whereas the vertical displacement is of 0.33mm. Figure 5 shows the von Mises stress around the supports and figure 6 the characteristic shape of the deformed structure. The amplification factor in figure 6 is 1000.

To check the distribution of compression and tension along the inner radius figure 7a-7e show the local Sxx stresses. The top module up to 30 degree is working under tension, from this module to the bottom one all are working under compression.

Concerning the connecting weld from the support structure to the sensible part of the module it has to be at least 8mm thick. (see figure3)

### Case III

The open structure has a maximum stress of 21 N/mm\({}^{\wedge}\)2 and deformations as following: horizontally: 0.22mm and vertically 0.37mm. (see fig. 8)

This means it is already more deformed than the closed structure. This deformation can be taken into account for the last module(s).

## 4 Conclusion

The study of the tile hadronic calorimter has shown that the stresses of the construction are far below the elastic limit of low carbon steel. Furthermore the values calculated permit now to determine how the connections have to be designed in detail.

The diamter will more likely be dominated by production tolerances than by the deformation due to the gravitational load.

Before doing any orders these calculations have to be checked.
