In ref. [1] it is shown that the Higgs boson should be detected with the ATLAS experiment for any mass allowed by the Standard Model. In the intermediate mass range (\(150<M_{H}<190\) GeV) the decay into W boson pairs is the most suitable one due to the large branching ratio. The Higgs branching fractions are plotted in figure 1 and it can be seen that -in the range considered here- the decay into W boson pairs is strongly enhanced. For masses higher than 170 GeV the decay channel into 4-leptons gold-plated channel becomes competitive.

The Higgs to pair decay channel followed by the fully leptonic decay of both \(W\)'s is discussed in ref. [1] as well as in ref. [2, 3]. Particular care is given to the inclusive Higgs production, and it has been shown that a signal can be spotted with a good statistical significance. However the discovery will be based on a "counting experiment" and it is important to exploit other channels to enhance this evidence. For this purpose we consider the production mechanism in which the Higgs boson is produced in association with a W boson. This channel provides a distinctive signature with 3 W bosons in the final state and with a low level of background. The price to pay is a lower -by a factor of about 10-event rate. Using this associated production channel the statistical significance is worse than in the inclusive channel, however we can achieve a good signal to background ratio (of the order of 2) so that the results are not so sensitive to the precise knowledge of the absolute normalization of the backgrounds.

It is worth to study the 3 W's final state in which all the W bosons decay into lepton pairs and the one in which two of them decay leptonically and one hadronically. The 3-lepton final state has already been studied [3] and in this work we concentrate on the second case. With the further requirement that the two charged leptons have the same sign we achieve the needed rejection against the production followed by a di-lepton decay as well as against many other physics backgrounds with opposite sign leptons in

the final state. In figure 2 we sketch the topology of the events we are looking for. The two W's decaying into leptons are the one produced in association with the Higgs boson and one from the Higgs decay as we are interested in the like-sign leptons signature.

From a theoretical standpoint this process is interesting as in the matrix element calculation only the gauge coupling between the Higgs and the \(W\) bosons is involved [4]. For this reason this channel can be also used to study models in which the Yukawa coupling is suppressed with respect to what predicted by the Standard Model as in the so-called fermiophobic models [5].

## 2 Signal and Background Simulation

The ATLAS detector has been simulated using the ATLFAST package [6] with a clustering cone of 0.4. The charged leptons are defined as isolated if the total energy released in a cone of radius 0.2 -excluding the lepton itself- is lower than 5 GeV and this is the only parameter which has been modified with respect to the default parameter setting for ATLFAST.

The charged lepton identification efficiency has been taken from ref. [7]. In particular we used a 90% efficiency for muons and a 70% for electrons. In the same approximation a jet rejection factor of 1.5\(\cdot\)10\({}^{5}\) has been used. It is important, in fact, to have a good e/jet separation to reduce the W+jets background with a jet faking an electron well below the other backgrounds. For this reason we decided to use the tightest e/jet separation criteria proposed in ref. [7] to make the W+jets background negligible in the final results. All the cross sections are then rescaled by these efficiency factors.

Jets are recontructed in a 0.4 cone in the \(\Delta R\) space using the standard ATLFAST clustering routine. To achieve the correct energy scale calibration a multiplicative correction factor as a function of the raw jet \(P_{T}\) has been applied [8]. This calibration corresponds to what will be available to ATLAS for single jet calibration with \(Z\)+jet events.

### Signal Generation

We generated different samples of about 20,000 events each for different Higgs masses with the PYTHIA Monte Carlo [9] using ISUB=26. The production cross sections times

Figure 2: _Sketch of the process studied in this work: \(pp\to WH\to WWW\)_

the branching ratio used in this note are shown in table 1 for different Higgs masses. It can be noted that the maximum value is for a Higgs mass around 160 GeV i.e. two times the W boson mass. The numbers presented in table 1 are in a good agreement with those from the 3-leptons analysis rescaled by the factor \(BR(W\to jj)/BR(W\to l^{\pm}\nu)=3.2\) with \(l^{\pm}\) being electron or muon. The decay \(W\to\tau\nu_{\tau}\) is not considered in this work, however we expect a small contribution from it as the leptons from tau decays are softer and we apply a tight cut on the electron/muon transverse momentum. The contribution from the \(W\to\tau\nu\) decay followed by \(\tau\to\)hadrons has been included for the simulation of \(t\bar{t}\) events where it was found to be small and therefore has been neglected for the other sources of background. For \(WZ\) background we considered also the decay \(Z\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) followed by a leptonic decay of one \(\tau\) and the hadronic decay of the other one.

The values used for the cross sections are from the PYTHIA predictions which are based on leading order calculations. It is known that the next-to-leading order cross section for the signal is greater by a factor of about 1.2 [10]. However for this work, we decided to follow the general ATLAS philosophy, i.e. use the leading order cross sections values for both signal and backgrounds.

### Background generation

The choice of the like-sign lepton pairs is very useful to reject many background processes with a two lepton final state signature as -for instance- \(t\bar{t}\) events followed by leptonic decay of both W's from the \(t\)'s. The cross section for this process is about three orders of magnitude bigger than the signal one, and without the requirement of the like sign leptons this would be an overwhelming background.

The main backgrounds which can be identified for the like-sign lepton channel are:

* Events with a W decaying into a \(l^{\pm}\nu\) pair and with a second lepton coming from the fragmentation of a heavy flavor quark. Those backgrounds are \(t\bar{t}\), single top and W\(b\bar{b}\) production;
* W+jet events with a jet misidentified as an electron. The cross section for these events is very large and it is very important to have a good e/jet separation. The study of the e/jet rejection capabilities with ATLAS is beyond the aim of this work, so we simulated this background by generating \(W\)+jet events with PYTHIA. One of

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c} \hline Mass (GeV) & \(\sigma\cdot\)BR (fb) \\ \hline
150 & 11.9 \\
160 & 14.3 \\
170 & 13.0 \\
180 & 10.3 \\
190 & 7.4 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: _Value of \(\sigma\cdot\)BR for the process considered as a function of the Higgs mass. These values are obtained with PYTHIA._the jets is then considered as an electron and the cross section rescaled by a factor \(1.5\cdot 10^{5}\) as described in [7];
* \(WZ\) with W\(\to l^{\pm}\nu\) and Z\(\to l^{+}l^{-}\) and with one lepton from the \(Z\) decay lost because it is too soft or because it is outside the fiducial \(\eta\) coverage of the detector. Also the \(Z\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) with one \(\tau\) decaying leptonically and the other one hadronically has been included; this particular \(Z\) decay channel contributes \(\approx 25\%\) of the total \(WZ\) contribution. A small contribution comes also from \(ZZ\) production followed by Z\(\to l^{+}l^{-}\);
* \(b\overline{b}\) events produced by QCD processes. Both charged leptons come from the fragmentation of the \(b\)-quarks. The production cross section of these events is huge [11] and we would need to generate billion events to simulate this background. However in the next section it is shown that from a study of the single lepton production rate we can conclude that this contribution is negligible.

The irreducible background due to three vector boson production is not studied in this work as we could not find a Monte Carlo generator to produce this process. The WWW irreducible cross section can be found in ref. [12], from where we can extrapolate \(\sigma\cdot\)BR\(=3\div 4\)fb, which is smaller than the signal. Therefore we expect a small background coming from this process, however this should be checked as soon as a Monte Carlo generator will be available.

Many of these processes can be easily simulated using PYTHIA, with the exception of W\(b\overline{b}\) production which has been simulated with the ONETOP Monte Carlo [13] which was developed in the ATLAS top group. This is a matrix element leading order calculation interfaced to PYTHIA for the partons fragmentation.

The cross sections used are taken from ref. [1].

## 3 Event Selection

### Cuts on Leptons

We start the selection of the WH events by requiring two charged leptons with the same sign. These events will be triggered by ATLAS by the single lepton trigger. Most of the events satisfying this requirement are events with a real W\(\to l\nu\) with another isolated lepton from a \(b\)-quark decay. A detailed list of these processes has been given in the previous section, here we want to stress that the second lepton (in descending \(P_{T}\) order) is usually very soft as it is produced by a 3-body decay of a \(b\)-quark whose typical \(P_{T}\) is of the order of 20\(\div\)30 GeV. In figure 3 we plot the \(P_{T}\) distribution of the leading lepton (on the left) and of the second one (on the right) for the signal, \(t\overline{t}\) events and \(WZ\) events. The distributions for the single top backgrounds are similar to the \(t\overline{t}\) ones.

We apply a 40 GeV cut on the \(P_{T}\) of the leading lepton and therefore we ensure a good trigger efficiency. The \(P_{T}\) distribution of the second lepton (see figure 3) has a steeply falling shape for the top backgrounds with a lepton coming from the fragmentation of a \(b\)-quark. A cut on the second lepton \(P_{T}\) provides a strong tool for background rejection, but the payoff is, of course, a low signal efficiency and we need to find a compromise between these two effects. The choice of 35 GeV has been found to be optimal (see section 3.4).

The \(b\overline{b}\) background has different characteristics. It is potentially dangerous as it can

Figure 3: \(P_{T}\) _distribution of the leading (left) and second lepton(right). The signal is \(\alpha\,\)mpa red with \(t\overline{t}\) and \(WZ\) events._

produce two isolated leptons from the decay of both \(b\)-quarks. This final state topology has a very low probability, but the production cross section of \(b\overline{b}\) pairs is huge (2\(\mu\)b for \(\hat{P}_{T}(b)>\)40 GeV). It is not possible to generate the events sample needed to adequately estimate this background. For this reason we used a fast procedure to evaluate whether this background is negligible or not by extracting the probability for a single \(b\)-quark to yield an isolated lepton and then we translate the results to the \(b\overline{b}\) case. To do this we generated 500,000 \(b\overline{b}\) events requiring \(\hat{P}_{T}>\)40 GeV (we are looking for leptons with \(P_{T}>\)30 GeV). From this simulated sample we single out the events with one isolated lepton in the final state with a \(P_{T}\) above a given threshold. The \(P_{T}\) distribution of these leptons is plotted in figure 4 in semilogarithmic scale. In this way we evaluate the probability of a \(b\)-quark to fragment into an isolated charged lepton. For \(P_{T}>\)35 GeV (\(P_{T}>\)40 GeV) we have 77 (39) single lepton events out of 1 million \(b\)-quark decays resulting in a probability of \(7.7\cdot 10^{-5}\) (\(3.9\cdot 10^{-5}\)). Moreover, in the 90% of the cases the lepton has the same sign of the generating \(b\)-quark (direct decay), while in the remaining 10% of the cases the charge is of opposite sign (cascade decay). The probabilitity for a \(b\overline{b}\) event to fake our signal is then:

\[{\cal P}=0.1\times 0.9\times 7.7\cdot 10^{-5}\times 3.9\cdot 10^{-5}\times 2 =5.4\cdot 10^{-10}\]

From this number we can estimate the cross section for \(b\overline{b}\to 2l^{\pm}\) to be of the order of:

\[\sigma(b\overline{b}\to 2l^{\pm})=2\mu{\rm b}\cdot 5.4\cdot 10^{-10}=\ 1.08 \mbox{fb}\]

This result has been obtained assuming no correlation between the two leptons, moreover the \(b\overline{b}\) cross section predicted by Pythia seems to be underestimated compared to that measured at the Tevatron [14]. However, even taking into account these uncertainties, the estimated \(\sigma(b\overline{b}\to 2l^{\pm})\) is lower than the signal cross section after the cuts on leptons (see table 3) i.e. 2.57 fb. Moreover the efficiency of the subsequent cuts is much higher for the signal than for this background and we can then reasonably conclude that the \(b\overline{b}\) background is small.

Figure 4: \(P_{T}\) _distribution of the isolated leptons found in simulated sample. The scale is semilogarithmic and the distribution is fitted with an exponential to guide the eye._

The angular distribution of the final state leptons is expected to be different for the signal and the backgrounds as they come from different processes. We use the variables suggested in reference [15], i.e. the invariant mass of the two charged leptons (\(m_{12}\)) and the angle of one lepton in their center of mass frame (\(\theta^{*}\)). The two one-dimensional distributions show small differences between signal and background which can not be used to define a cut. However, if the scatter plot of the two variables shows that the region of the plane populated by the signal events and by the background is different as depicted in figure 5. The cut applied is indicated by the full curve in the plots and is expressed by:

\[m_{12}>80\cdot\cos^{2}\theta^{*}+40\]

### Cuts on Jets

The signal is expected to have two jets in the final state whose invariant mass is the W mass1. No other jet activity is expected apart from initial and final state QCD radiation.

Figure 5: _Scatter plot of \(m_{12}\) vs. \(\cos\theta^{*}\) for the signal and for three backgrounds. The events selected are the ones above the full line._

In some backgrounds (\(WZ\), \(ZZ\) and \(W+jet\)) no jet activity is expected, apart from initial or final state QCD radiation yielding low \(P_{T}\) jets. In single top events we expect two jets in the final state as for the signal. In particular in \(Wt\) events we have a \(W\to jj\) decay so the two jet invariant mass is expected to peak at the \(W\) mass. Finally \(t\overline{t}\) events contain four jets in the final state with two of them coming from a \(W\) decay.

The distribution of the number of jets reconstructed is shown in figure 6. As a first step, we require the reconstruction of at least two jets with a \(P_{T}\) above 15 GeV for the low luminosity case. With this cut we discriminate the signal from events with low jet activity as -for instance\(-\)\(WZ\) events. It is known from previous studies [1, 16] that cuts at \(P_{T}\approx 15\) GeV can not be used at high luminosity as pile-up produces many low \(P_{T}\) jets, therefore we increase the \(P_{T}\) threshold to 30 GeV. In a second step we apply a veto against extra-jet activity which is known to be a strong handle for \(t\overline{t}\) rejection. We find that a 30 GeV veto is optimal for both the low and the high luminosity cases.

The invariant mass of the two jets which are present in the final state after the jet selection is plotted in figure 7-a. As expected the signal events present a peak at the W mass. There is also a tail in the low mass side mainly due to energy escaping outside the clustering cones. The same peak is present for \(t\overline{t}\) events. In this latter case there are also events outside the peak, because sometimes the two jets selected are not those from the \(W\) decay. Similarly a peak at 80 GeV is present also for \(Wt\) events (not shown in figure 7-a). In the other cases (as for the WZ events shown in figure) the distributions do not exhibit any particular structure. A cut is applied requiring that the di-jet invariant mass is within \(2\sigma\) of the reconstructed peak.

Finally we apply a cut on the minimum distance between the leading jet and the two charged leptons. For the signal this distance is small as the two W's from the Higgs decay are in the same hemisphere and so are one charged lepton and the jets. For the backgrounds no correlation is expected as can be seen in figure 7-b.

### Results

The effect of the cuts described in the previous paragraphs is reported in table 3 for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) at low luminosity and in table 4 for 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) at high luminosity. Here we include a 80% lepton efficiency coming from an average of 70% for electrons and 90% for muons as explained in the previous section. We assume also a \(1.5\cdot 10^{5}\) jet rejection factor for the \(W\)+jets background. It can be seen that with the cuts applied this background is small i.e. it is well below the other backgrounds.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c} \hline Cut & \(H\to W\,W\) & \(t\overline{t}\) & Single Top & Single Top & W \(bb\) & \(W\,Z,ZZ\) & W +jets \\  & (170 GeV) & & Wg fusion & Wt prod. & & & \\ \hline No cuts & 390 & \(5.6\cdot 10^{6}\) & \(1.6\cdot 10^{6}\) & \(5.3\cdot 10^{5}\) & \(2\cdot 10^{6}\) & \(1.6\cdot 10^{4}\) & \(4.7\cdot 10^{8}\) \\ \hline \multicolumn{1}{l|}{Likesign, \(P_{T}(1)>40\),} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \\ \(P_{T}(12)>3\,5\)GeV & 77 & 133 & 30 & 16 & 46 & 34 5 & 4 2.4 \\ \(\mathrm{m}_{ll}>80\cdot\cos^{2}\theta^{*}\)+40 & 50 & 73 & 21 & 11 & 34 & 155 & 12 \\ \(N_{jet}\geq\)2 & 42 & 70 & 16 & 10 & 3.2 & 48 & 5.8 \\ \(P_{T}(\mathrm{j}1\,\mathrm{j}2)\)\(>\)15GeV & & & & & & & \\ \(P_{T}(\mathrm{j}3)\)\(<30\,\)GeV & 29.1 & 18.9 & 13.0 & 5.1 & 0.8 & 40.1 & 4.4 \\ \(\mathrm{m}_{jj}=80\,\pm 2\sigma\) & 17.4 & 6.4 & 2.9 & 2.3 & 0.2 & 8.7 & 1.0 \\ \(\mathrm{min}\,\Delta\)R(\(\mathrm{l},\mathrm{j}\))\(<\)1.2 & 14.7 & 2.5 & 0.5 & 0.9 & \(<0.2\) & 3.7 & 0.5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

On the right (b): Minimum distance between the leading jet and the two charged leptons for the signal (full line) and the \(t\overline{t}\) (dashed), and Wg-fusion single top (dash dotted) backgrounds._In all cases -except \(WZ,ZZ\)- a very strong rejection is achieved with the requirement of two high \(P_{T}\) leptons with the same sign which is the distinctive signature of the process under study.

After all the cuts the largest background is represented by \(WZ\) and \(t\overline{t}\) events.

Finally, the statistical significances obtained for this channel are shown in table 5 using both the Gaussian and Poisson statistical approach. The final results are worse than that obtained in the inclusive channel [2], but -at high luminosity- the expected signal is above the \(5\sigma\) level which is needed to claim a discovery. We also find that the signal efficiency increases with the Higgs mass from 4.1% to 5% for \(M_{H}\) going from 160 to 190 GeV. A drop in efficiency is seen for 150 GeV because many events fail the invariant mass cut as one \(W\) is off-shell.

An important feature of this channel is that the signal to background ratio is about 2, to be compared with 50% for the inclusive channel, thus the knowledge of the absolute background normalization is less critical.

### Estimate of the Monte Carlo statistical uncertainty of the background

The total number of Monte Carlo events generated is reported in table 6 together with the number of events surviving the cuts.

To estimate the uncertainty on the total background due to the limited statistics of the generated samples we used a toy Monte Carlo based on 100,000 pseudo-experiments. For each pseudo-experiment, the number of events surviving the cuts and corresponding to a given background have been randomized according to a Poisson distribution whose mean is taken from the rightmost column of table 6. The numbers obtained are then rescaled to the number of events expected for that particular background either for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) or 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). A distribution of the total background events is then obtained by summing for each experiment the rescaled value of each background contribution. This distribution for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) is shown in figure 8. The width is a measurement of the uncertainty due to the limited statistics of the generated sample. This distribution is roughly symmetric and from a gaussian fit we can express the number of backgroud events expected as:

\[N(30\ \mbox{fb}^{-1}) =8.1\pm 0.8\] \[N(100\ \mbox{fb}^{-1}) =15.4\pm 2.1\]

The uncertainty in the background evaluation from the Monte Carlo statistics is then about 10%.

### Study of the Cuts

The results presented in the previous paragraph are obtained using the set of cuts which we found to be optimal. In table 7 we show the effect of a variation of the most critical

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c} \hline Process & Number of MC & Number of MC & MC events \\  & events & events (fb\({}^{-1}\)) & after cuts \\ \hline Higgs(\(m_{H}=\)170 GeV) & \(\approx\) 20K & 1540 & 575 \\ \(t\overline{t}\) & 34 M & 173 & 18 \\ \(Wg\) fusion & 13.2M & 244 & 5 \\ \(Wt\) & 4.7M & 264 & 10 \\ \(W+b\overline{b}\) & 8.1M & 121 & 0 \\ \(WZ(Z\to\mu^{\pm}/e^{\pm})\) & 200K & 526 & 54 \\ \(WZ(Z\to\tau^{\pm})\) & 200K & 1052 & 43 \\ \(ZZ\) & 100K & 1430 & 13 \\ \(W+\)Jets & 200K & 1500 & 33 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: _The number of Monte Carlo events produced for the signal and each background is reported in the second column. The luminosity needed to accumulate this number is reported in the third column. In the rightmost column the number of Monte Carlo events surviving the cuts for the low luminosity selection is given._ones, i.e. the cut on the \(P_{T}\) of the second lepton, the \(P_{T}\) of the jets and on the jet veto threshold. This study is done for the low luminosity scenario and the \(W+b\overline{b}\) column is omitted as this background is small. It can be noted that the chosen cuts are optimal. We did not lower the jet thresholds below 15 GeV.

The significance depends on the cut applied on the second lepton as well as on the two leading jets which are the products of the Higgs boson decay. There is only a slight dependence on the jet veto, therefore the veto threshold can be set in the range \(15\div 30\) GeV.

The total numer of events could be increased if a smaller jet rejection factor was used. Referring again to ref. [7] it is possible to use an electron efficiency of 80% with a rejection against jets of about \(10^{4}\). However we prefer to use a strong rejection to keep the \(W+\)jets background as low as possible.

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c} \hline Cut Changed & \(H\to WW\) & \(t\overline{t}\) & Single Top & Single Top & \(W\,Z,ZZ\) & \(W+\)jets & \(S/\sqrt{B}\) \\  & (170 GeV) & & Wg fusion & Wt prod. & & & \\ \hline Reference & 14.7 & 2.5 & 0.5 & 0.9 & 3.7 & 0.5 & 5.2 \\ \hline \(P_{T}(12)>30\) GeV & 16.9 & 4.8 & 0.8 & 2.0 & 4.3 & 0.7 & 4.8 \\ \(P_{T}(12)>40\) GeV & 11.7 & 1.5 & 0.3 & 0.5 & 3.8 & 0.4 & 4.6 \\ \hline \(P_{T}(j1,j2)>25\) GeV & 13.4 & 2.5 & 0.5 & 0.9 & 3.0 & 0.5 & 4.9 \\ \(P_{T}(j1,j2)>30\) GeV & 9.7 & 1.7 & 0.5 & 0.6 & 1.7 & 0.3 & 4.4 \\ \hline veto (20 GeV) & 11.4 & 1.5 & 0.5 & 0.4 & 2.6 & 0.5 & 4.9 \\ veto (40 GeV) & 16.4 & 4.1 & 0.6 & 1.3 & 3.8 & 0.7 & 5.1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 4 Higgs Mass Reconstruction

The reconstruction of the Higgs mass is not easy in this channel since one has to select the correct charged lepton out of the two present in the final state and to reconstruct the momentum of the neutrino from the Higgs decay. In this section we report a first attempt to reconstruct the Higgs mass, trying to infer the 4-momenta of the final state particles. The lepton coming from the Higgs decay is chosen to be the one closer in \(\Delta\phi\) to the leading jet. This assignement is correct in about 80% of the cases.

The transverse momentum of the neutrino from the Higgs decay cannot be easily inferred as we measure the total transverse missing momentum which is the sum of two contributions. Many attempts to reconstruct it have been made, finally it was found that the best approximation is to define the neutrino transverse momentum as \(\vec{P}_{T}(\nu)=-\vec{P}_{T}(\mbox{charged lepton})\). The longitudinal component can then be calculated by imposing the \(W\) mass constraint to the neutrino-charged lepton pair and by choosing the lower solution.

The reconstructed invariant mass is reported in figure 9 for \(M_{H}\)=170 GeV and \(M_{H}=\)190 GeV. A peak around the generated mass can be noted and its position has a (slight) dependence on the Higgs mass. Figure 10 shows the mass distribution for the signal+background (solid line) together with the background alone (dashed line) at low luminosity (on the left) and at high luminosity (on the right) for \(M_{H}=170\) GeV. In both distributions the signal peaks at a slightly lower value than the background but -because of the limited number of events\(-\) it will be not easy to extract precisely the Higgs mass.

## 5 Conclusions

The feasibility of the Higgs detection with the ATLAS experiment using the decay channel \(WH\to WWW\to 2l^{\pm}2\nu 2\)jet has been studied. Requiring two like-sign charged leptons rejects! most of the Standard Model backgrounds. Applying a tight cut on the \(P_{T}\) of the leptons, together with cuts on associated jets, we reduce the total background events to 50% of the expected signal events.

We have shown that a signal can be observed in the mass range \(150<m_{\,H}<190\) GeV with a statistical significance at the level of about 4 with 30fb\({}^{-1}\) of d at a at low luminosity and above 5 for 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) at high luminosity.

An important feature of this channel is that the signal to background ratio is of the order of 2 and therefore the signal detection would not be compromised by the knowledge of the absolute normalization of the backgrounds.

We can conclude that this channel can be useful (together with other channels) to detect the Higgs boson in the intermediate mass range even after the first three years of running at low luminosity.

Finally a first attempt to reconstruct the Higgs mass has been made. More work is needed to define a technique similar to what has been done for the 3-leptons channel and it will be the subject of a future work.
