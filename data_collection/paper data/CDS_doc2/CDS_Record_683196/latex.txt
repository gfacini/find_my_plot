**Abstract**

The possibility of replacing one or more of the Silicon Strip Detector layers with large pixel detectors is an option in the ATLAS Technical proposal[1]. To study the performance of Large Pixels within the SLUG/DICE software a geometry using them has been implemented.

## 1 Introduction

Pixel silicon detectors have some advantages over strip detectors.

Therefore there is no need of a projective readout, and there are no ambiguities concerning the hit positions. The pixel detectors give a clearly defined two-dimensional picture, reduce therefore the amount of time needed and increase the efficiency of the track reconstruction.

Up to now, small pixels are planned for the innermost part of the detector. At larger radii so small patches are neither required nor affordable and the large pixels (Lpix) are sufficient to offer all the pixel advances without exploding the budget. The use of the Lpix-layers would also increase the radiation hardness of the detector. Therefore the option of large pixel replacing one or two strip layers was taken into consideration [2].

But the main effect of the large pixels should be the increase of the track reconstruction efficiency. For example: the reconstruction efficiency of the three-prong \(\tau\) decay in the barrel region is only \(84\pm 4\)% [3]. This should be significantly increased as the evaluation of the Lpix information is properly implemented in the pattern recognition routines.

A brief description of the simulation usage is given in section 4, while the reconstruction is described in section 5. Section 6 gives some first results.

In this paper it is assumed that the user is familiar with the ATLAS simulation software (SLUG [4]/DICE).

The possibility of replacing the silicon strip layers at 30 and 50 cm with Large Pixel layers has been implemented. These two layers differ only by their position, their properties are identical. The default granularity is 100\(\mu\)m in \(R\phi\) and 2 cm in z. These and all other parametres of the detector are defined and commented in the subroutine //LPIXDICE/LPIXEL/LPIXDF10. Figure 1 shows the geometry of the new layers as plotted by the interactive GEANT in the \(R\,\phi\)-plane.

## 2 Simulating the new geometry

Simulating with one or two large pixel layers is not more difficult than with the geometries already implemented. The steps to be carried out are discussed in this section.

Figure 1: Detector layout plotted by interactive GEANT1. Using the correction file and compiling The FORTRAN code needed for simulating large pixels is stored in a correction file for the DICE [5] CMZ, version 2.04_00, namedlargepixel.corr (In future versions of DICE these corrections will be implemented). It can be found in the directory $LHC_R00T/dev/src/cma

 The following is an example macro for CMZ; it is part of the macro $LHC_R00T/dev/macros/atl_bin.kumac with one modification. :

2. Running the simulation with datacards The steering works via datacards. There are two example datacards: lpixel2.datacard for two, lpixel1.datacard for one Large pixel layer.

They can be found in $LHC_ROOT/datacard. Three new geometries for the inner detector have been added: Geometries 10, 11 and 12 which are like those with number 3, 4 and 5 respectively with the exception of the 30 and 50 cm silicon strip layers replaced by large pixel layers.

To activate one of the new geometries, *MODE 'INNE' 'GEOM' has to be set to 10, 11 or 12. Changes of the geometry or material parameters can be achieved through the *DETP 'LPIX' parnum=newvalue and the *DETD 'LPIX' parnum=newvalue datacards. This method is used in the file lpixell.datacard to use only one large pixel layer at \(r=30\)cm (two layers are default).

## 3 Reconstruction

The reconstruction uses the standard IPatRec[7] routines, using also the information from the Large Pixel layers.

The code will be officially released with the 1.06 version of ATRECON. In $LHC_ROOT/datacard one can also find an example datacard for the reconstruction called rec.datacard. The reconstruction with large pixel layers is activated by adding

*MODE 'LPIX' 'RECO' 1 'PRIN' 0

in analogy to the reconstruction of other detectors.

With a general print level (from IPAT) of 2 or greater, one can see if Large Pixels are found. The output should contain lines similar to the following:

initPat: Initialising window commons plus /Const/, /BField/ and geometry table  start building the GEOM table:  adding MSGC with 26 superlayers, 26 (DICE) layers and 390 elements  adding GAAS with 4 superlayers, 2 (DICE) layers and 16 elements  adding SCT with 2 superlayers, 4 (DICE) layers and 56 elements  adding BPIX with 2 superlayers, 2 (DICE) layers and 24 elements  adding IPIX with 2 superlayers, 2 (DICE) layers and 52 elements

With the 'PRIN' statement of LPIX the output level can be adjusted. If the print level is set to a higher value, LPIXUNP prints out the hit position. An example for the output is shown here:

LPIXUNP - DIGITIZED HIT. Layer: 1 Hit # 1 X Y Z -9.426 28.451 -18.613 LPIXUNP - DIGITIZED HIT. Layer: 1 Hit # 2 X Y Z -9.426 28.451 -18.413 LPIXUNP - DIGITIZED HIT. Layer: 2 Hit # 1 X Y Z -15.704 47.333 -25.418 LPIXUNP - DIGITIZED HIT. Layer: 2 Hit # 2 X Y Z -15.713 47.329 -25.418

## 4 First Studies using LPix

Up to now, our work has concentrated on the performance of the iPatRec reconstruction using the Large Pixel layers. We started with performance studies of the new layout by simulating 1000 single muon and electron events with each layout for different transverse momenta. The figure 2 shows an example plot with the resolution for the transverse momentum. The code has been tested on UNIX machines with different architectures including IBM RS/6000, HP and DEC Alpha.
