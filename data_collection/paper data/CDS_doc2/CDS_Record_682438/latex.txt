**Abstract**

The possibility to detect anomalous couplings in the gauge boson sector is investigated in the context of the ATLAS detector at LHC. The measurements of distributions of kinematic variables from gauge bosons pair production allows a measurement of possible anomalous couplings for both \(WWZ\) and \(WW\gamma\) vertices or to set limits on them. For this study the main sources of background with leptons and photons are considered and appropriate cuts to minimize them are applied.

Introduction

There is a strong interest to study the couplings between gauge bosons : the coupling of three gauge bosons, which is fixed by the SU(2) symmetry of the Standard Model can exhibit underlying non-standard physics. Indeed many kinds of new physics give non-standard contributions to this particular vertex [1][2] and measurements of possible anomalous couplings may offer a way to reach the origin and structure of the Higgs sector [3].

In the Standard Model, the three boson vertices come from the non-commutative part of the SU(2)\(\otimes\)U(1) gauge symmetry. The Lagrangian of the free field (when restricting ourselves to SU(2)) is written as :

\[{\cal L}=-\frac{1}{4}\ W_{i}^{\ \mu\nu}\ W_{i\mu\nu}\]

with \(W_{i}^{\ \mu\nu}=\partial^{\mu}W_{i}^{\ \nu}-\partial^{\nu}W_{i}^{\ \mu}+g\, \epsilon_{ijk}W_{j}^{\ \mu}W_{k}^{\ \nu}\ \,\ \ \ \ (i=1,2,3)\)

The \(g\,\epsilon_{ijk}W_{j}^{\ \mu}W_{k}^{\ \nu}\) term will generate, in the perturbative development, the following graphs, which are respectively the three boson and four boson vertices:

If some non-standard physics appears, the Lagrangian of the Standard Model can be replaed by an effective Lagrangian written, if terms violating discrete symmetries (C,P,CP) are not taken into account, as:

a) for the \(WW\gamma\) case:

\[{\cal L}_{WW\,\gamma}=-ie\left\{(W_{\mu\nu}^{\ \dagger}\,W^{\mu}\,A^{\nu}-W_{ \mu}^{\dagger}A_{\nu}\,W^{\mu\nu})+\kappa_{\gamma}W_{\mu}^{\ \dagger}W_{\nu}\,F^{\mu\nu}+\frac{\lambda_{\gamma}}{m_{W}^{2}}W_{\alpha\mu}^{ \dagger}\,W_{\nu}^{\mu}F^{\nu\alpha}\right\},\]

where \(A^{\mu}\) and \(W^{\mu}\) are respectively the photon and W fields and

\(W_{\mu\nu}=\partial_{\mu}\,W_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}\,W_{\mu}\), \(F_{\mu\nu}=\partial_{\mu}\,A_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}\,A_{\mu}\) et \(\tilde{F}_{\mu\nu}=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}F^{\rho\sigma}\).

b) for the \(WWZ\) case :

\[{\cal L}_{WW\,Z}=-ie\ cot\theta_{W}\ \left\{g_{1}(W_{\mu\nu}^{\ \dagger}\,W^{\mu}Z^{\nu}-W_{\mu}^{ \dagger}Z_{\nu}\,W^{\mu\nu})+\kappa_{Z}W_{\mu}^{\dagger}W_{\nu}\,Z^{\mu\nu}+ \frac{\lambda_{Z}}{m_{W}^{2}}W_{\alpha\mu}^{\dagger}W_{\nu}^{\mu}\,Z^{\nu \alpha}\right\},\]

where \(Z^{\mu}\) and \(W^{\mu}\) are respectively the Z and W fields and

\(W_{\mu\nu}=\partial_{\mu}\,W_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}\,W_{\mu}\), \(Z_{\mu\nu}=\partial_{\mu}Z_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}\,Z_{\mu}\) et \(\tilde{Z}_{\mu\nu}=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}Z^{\rho\sigma}\).

We will, in addition, fix here \(g_{1}=\)1, i.e. its Standard Model value, to restrict the study to pure three boson vertex anomalies.

Figure 1: Three and four bosons graphs of the electroweak Standard Model

We have then a set of 4 parameters that can describe, in a "general way" possible non-standard physics (in the Standard Model : \(\kappa_{\gamma}\)=1, \(\lambda_{\gamma}\)=0, \(\kappa_{Z}\)=1, \(\lambda_{Z}\)=0). The present bounds on those parameters are of several hundred % and are expected to be reduce at the level of 10% at LEP 200.

Another important point for the relevance of the study concerning the three boson vertices at high energy is the form factor. In compositeness model it is usual to include a form factor, which describes the spatial extension of the proton charge :

\[F_{\Lambda}(\hat{s})=\frac{1}{\left(1+\frac{i}{\Lambda^{2}}\right)^{n}},\]

where \(\Lambda\) is associated to the "size" of the system [4][2] and can be identified with the energy scale where compositeness manifests itself.

This form factor is necessary here because of the process: \(e^{+}e^{-}\to W^{+}W^{-}\), which restricts the \(WW\gamma\) coupling to its Standard Model value for asymptotically high energy (this is also true for the \(WWZ\) vertex).

## 2 The signals

In hadron colliders like the LHC, the three boson vertices (\(WW\gamma\) and \(WWZ\)) take part in gauge boson pair production (i.e. \(W\gamma\), \(WZ\) and \(W^{+}W^{-}\)).

The two processes studied in this note are the production of \(W\gamma\) and \(WZ\). The \(W^{+}W^{-}\) process is swamped by \(t\overline{t}\) background, two orders of magnitude higher.

The production of a gauge boson pair in a hadron collider involves the three following graphs:

Figure 2: Diagrams for boson pair production

A possible abnormal contribution to \(W\gamma\) production \(\Delta{\cal M}_{h\,\gamma\,h\nu}\) (where \(h_{W}\) and \(h_{\gamma}\) are the W and \(\gamma\) helicities) can be written as [8] :

\[\Delta{\cal M}_{\pm\,o} = \frac{e^{2}}{\sin\theta_{W}}\ \frac{\sqrt{\hat{s}}}{2m_{W}}\ [\kappa_{ \gamma}-1+\,\lambda_{\gamma}]\frac{1}{2}(1\mp\cos\Theta)\]

and

\[\Delta{\cal M}_{\pm\pm} = \frac{e^{2}}{\sin\theta_{W}}\ \frac{\hat{s}}{2m_{W}^{2}}\ \lambda_{\gamma}\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sin\Theta\]

where \(\Theta\) is the scattering angle of the photon with respect to the quark direction.

These contributions increase to infinity at high energy and this demonstrates the need for a fom factor. We can also conclude that deviations from the Standard Model will increase with energy.

The signal for possible non-standard couplings will appear in the invariant mass of the gauge boson pair where an excess of events compared to the Standard Model is expected at the highest energies (e.g. in transverse momentum and transverse mass distribution). For the \(W\gamma\) case, non-standard couplings can also be searched for in the angular distribution of the photon where a zero amplitude is expected in the Standard Model, for a particular value of this angle.

The signal processes have to use leptonic decays of the W and Z, so that they can be triggered on and also that they are not swamped by purely hadronic events from QCD production.

## 3 The simulation of the detector and event generation

The simulation of the detector is done in the following way, using simple parametrisation of the ATLAS performance :

a) The electromagnetic calorimeter is divided into projective cells with a granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) = 0.02 \(\times\) 0.02 and with a rapidity \(|\eta|<3\). For electrons and photons, all the energy of the particle is deposited in the hit cell with a smearing according to the following resolution:

\[\frac{\sigma}{E} = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus\ b\oplus\frac{c}{\sqrt{E}}\right) \alpha_{{}_{track}}\oplus\ \frac{d}{E},\]

where

\(a\) = 0.10

\(b\) = 0.007

\(c\) = 0.02

\(d\) = 0.250

\(\alpha_{track}\) = \(\left\{\begin{array}{ll}4,&\mbox{if $1.74<|\eta|<1.86$;}\\ 1,&\mbox{if not.}\end{array}\right.\)

b) For the hadronic part, the granularity is twice coarser and the resolution is given by :\[\frac{\sigma}{E} = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus b\right)\,\alpha_{c,rack},\]

where

\(a\) = 0.50

\(b\) = 0.02

\(a\) = 0.50

\(b\) = 0.02

\(a\) = 0.50

\(b\) = 0.02

\(a\) = 0.50

\(b\) = 0.02

\(a\) = 0.50

\(b\) = 0.02

Factor to simulate energy degradation

\(a_{c,rack}\) = \(\left\{\begin{array}{ll}4,&\mbox{if $1.74<|\eta|<1.86$;}\\ 1,&\mbox{if not.}\end{array}\right.\)

c) For the muons, the momentum is smeared according to the parametrisation of the Atlas muon spectrometer up to \(|\eta|<3\)[5].

d) For this study the \(p_{T}\) threshold (i.e. the trigger requirements) for photons, electrons and muons is above 20 GeV, with a rapidity coverage up to \(|\eta|\)=2.5

e) A classical jet algorithm (UA1-like) is used to reconstruct the jets.

The event generation used PYTHIA 5.7. The centre-of-mass energy is \(\sqrt{s}\)= 14 TeV, with an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\)_pb\({}^{-1}\)_ per year. For the standard processes, the PYTHIA matrix elements were used, except for \(Zb\overline{b}\) and anomalous couplings that have been introduced into PYTHIA from matrix element calculations as external processes.

## 4 Study of \(W\gamma\) production

We restrict this study to the leptonic decay of the W. The trigger is then defined as two electromagnetic clusters (\(\gamma e\)) ore one electromagnetic cluster and a muon (\(\gamma\mu\)), all of high \(p_{T}\).

The background comes from processes with a \(\gamma\) and a lepton in the final state :

* Real \(\gamma\) and real lepton: \(pp\to\gamma\,b\overline{b}\) (\(+\,X\)) \(\to\)\(\gamma l\nu\) (\(+\,X\)) \(pp\to\gamma t\overline{t}\) (\(+\,X\)) \(\to\)\(\gamma l\nu\) (\(+\,X\)) \(pp\to\gamma\,Z\) (\(+\,X\)) \(\to\)\(\gamma l\) (\(+\,X\))
* Real \(\gamma\) and fake electron (no fake muons of high-\(p_{T}\) are expected in ATLAS): \(pp\to\gamma\,+\,jet\) (\(+\,X\))
* Fake \(\gamma\) and real lepton: \(pp\to W+jet\) (\(+\,X\)) \(\to l\nu+jet\) (\(+\,X\)) \(pp\to b\overline{b}\) (\(+\,X\)) \(\to l\nu+jet\) (\(+\,X\)) \(pp\to t\overline{t}\) (\(+\,X\)) \(\to l\nu+jet\) (\(+\,X\))

We summarise in Table 1 the relative importance of the various backgrounds using the ratio :

\[\frac{\sigma_{B}}{\sigma_{S}} = \frac{\sigma_{pp\to p_{T}occ\,ass\to\gamma lX}}{\sigma_{pp\to\gamma W \to\gamma lX}}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c||} \hline Process & \(bb\gamma\) & \(t\overline{t}\gamma\) & \(Z\gamma\) & \(\gamma+jet\) & \(W+jet\) & \(bb\overline{b}\) & \(t\overline{t}\) \\ \hline \(\sigma_{B}/\sigma_{S}\) & 42 & 0.20 & 0.04 & 10000 & 500 & 550000 & 30 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: _Ratio between the cross-sections of the backgrounds and the cross-section of the signal (\(|\eta_{\gamma}|\) and \(|\eta_{h}|<\) 2.5 ) (see text)_

Rejection factors against jets faking electrons and photons have been taken according to previous detailed simulations. For photons we will use R= 10000 [6] and for electrons R=10\({}^{5}\)[7]. The designation of 'jet' does not include \(b\)-quark jets which are studied separately.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]

### Selection from "hadronic activity"

After all the previous cuts are applied, the remaining background events come mainly from \(t\overline{t}\gamma\) process where a real \(W\gamma\) pair can be produced in the decay chain. But in that case the difference with respect to the direct production of \(W\gamma\) is a strong hadronic activity associated with the \(W\gamma\) pair.

First we use any second isolated lepton that could come from the second W (with \(p_{T}\) above 10 GeV and \(\eta<2.5\)) as a veto.

We have then to find a new variable that characterises this hadronic activity. We will use the transverse momentum of an extra jet in the event. If we use a cut on the most energetic ( i.e. highest \(p_{T}\), \(|\eta|<5\)) extra jet in the events, asking for 85%

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c|c|c|c|c|c|c||} \hline Cut & \(W\gamma\) & \(W+jet\) & \(b\overline{b}\) & \(t\overline{t}\) & \(b\overline{b}\gamma\) & \(t\overline{t}\gamma\) \\ \hline \(p_{T\gamma}>100\) GeV + \(p_{Tl}>40\) GeV & 9500 & 900 & 1100 & 1100 & 50000 & 13000 \\ \hline + Isolation & 9100 & 800 & 25 & 900 & 950 & 10500 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:9]

### Sensitivity to \(\kappa_{\gamma}\) and \(\lambda_{\gamma}\)

Possible non-standard couplings lead to deviations from the Standard Model. Those deviations are the signals we will now search for in the various kinematic variables and their significance will be compared to the expected Standard Model plus backgrounds rates.

#### 4.4.1 Signal of anomalous coupling

A dipolar form factor is used for the anomalous coupling, with a cut-off \(\Lambda\) equal to 10 TeV. This results in an effective coupling that does not violate unitarity [8].

We use the most sensitive variables to compare the Standard Model predictions to those from a model with an anomalous coupling :

a) the photon transverse momentum \(p_{\tau\,\gamma}\).

b) the transverse mass \(M_{T}\) is computed following the definition given in [9] :

\[M_{T}^{2}=\left(p_{\tau_{\gamma}}+\sqrt{(m_{t\gamma}^{2}+p_{\tau\,1\gamma}^{2} )}\right)^{2}-\left(p_{\tau_{\nu}}+p_{\tau\,1\gamma}\right)^{2}\]

\[with\qquad p_{\tau\,1\gamma}=p_{\tau\,1}+p_{\tau\,\gamma}\qquad and\qquad m_{ \gamma}^{2}=\left(\tilde{p}_{1}+\tilde{p_{\gamma}}\right)^{2}\]

This definition allows to obtain a sharper jacobian peak when compared to a classical one.

c) to compute the photon rapidity it is necessary to be in the referential of the \(W\gamma\) pair and so to know the W momentum. This momentum is computed using the W-mass constraint and we will therefore have two solutions for each event and use both with a weight of one half. The variable used is :

\[|y^{*}|=\left|\frac{1}{2}\ ln\frac{1+\cos\theta}{1-\cos\theta}\right|,\]

,

where \(\theta\) is the angle between the photon and the beam direction in the \(W\gamma\) pair reference system. A cut \(p_{\tau\,\gamma}>200\) GeV is used to enhance the sensitivity to a possible anomalous coupling.

Figures 7,8,9 for \(\kappa_{\gamma}\) and 10,11, 12 for \(\lambda_{\gamma}\) show the deviations of the expected distributions from the Standard Model predictions (including background) after all cuts.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Cut & \(W\gamma\) & \(W+jet\) & \(b\bar{b}\) & \(t\bar{t}\) & \(b\bar{b}\gamma\) & \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) \\ \hline \(p_{\tau\,\gamma}>\) 100 GeV & 11500 & 1400 & 7000 & 3000 & 380000 & 75000 \\ \hline + \(p_{\tau\,l}>\) 40 GeV & 9500 & 900 & 1100 & 1100 & 50000 & 13000 \\ \hline + Isolation & 9100 & 800 & 25 & 900 & 950 & 10500 \\ \hline + \(p_{\tau\,second\,extra\,jet}<\) 25 GeV & 7500 & 650 & 14 & 90 & 40 & 750 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

First, a trigger on three leptons (\(p_{T_{lepton}}>10\) GeV) is required and we compute the invariant mass of all opposite charge pairs. The pair that minimizes \(|M_{inv(l)}-M_{Z}|\) is chosen to be the one coming from the Z decay. Then the W is reconstructed using the remaining lepton and the missing transverse momentum is identified with the neutrino transverse momentum.

#### 5.1.1 Selection using the two leptons coming from the Z

The cut on the transverse momentum of the two leptons is in fact a cut on the smaller one. It is fixed at \(p_{T_{lepton}}\)\(z>25\) GeV and suppresses the \(b\overline{b}\) background

Then the W is reconstructed using the remaining lepton and the missing transverse momentum is identified with the neutrino transverse momentum.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:17]

#### 5.1.2 Selection using the lepton coming from the W

The cut on the transverse momentum of the lepton from W is fixed at \(p_{T_{leptonW}}>25\) GeV. This cut is efficient for reducing the \(Zb\overline{b}\) and \(t\overline{t}\) backgrounds with three real leptons.

We reconstruct the transverse invariant mass of the W with :

\[M_{T\,W}^{\ 2}\ =2p_{T\,l}p_{T_{\nu}}(1-cos\phi_{l\nu})\]

where \(cos\phi_{l\nu}\) is the azimuthal angle between \(p_{T\,l}\) and \(p_{T\,\nu}\).

The cut is fixed at \(M_{T\,W}>40\) GeV (see figure 16)

The results after all cuts (see table 15) are summarized in table 16.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline Cut \\ \hline \(|\eta_{lepton\,s}|<\ 2.5\) \\ \(p_{T_{lepton\,s}Z}>\ 25\) GeV \\ \(p_{T_{leptonW}}>\ 25\) GeV \\ \(E_{con\,<\ 10}\) GeV (Isolation) \\ \(|M_{in\,{\rm{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{ \it{   }}}}}}}}}}}}}}-M_{Z}|<\ 10\) GeV \\ \hline \(M_{T}\,W>40\) GeV \\ \hline \end{tabular} \end{table

### Sensitivity to \(\kappa_{Z}\) and \(\lambda_{Z}\)

#### 5.2.1 Signal of anomalous coupling

We use the most sensitive variables to compare the Standard Model predictions to those from a model with an anomalous coupling :

a) the transverse momentum \(p_{T\,Z}\) is obtained with the two associated leptons.

b) the invariant mass of the pair \(WZ\) is defined by :

\[M_{T\,W\,Z} = \left(p_{T_{\nu}}+\sqrt{(m_{T\,Z}^{2}+p_{T\,Z}^{2})}\right)^{2}- \left(p_{T_{\nu}}+p_{T\,Z}\right)^{2}\] \[where\qquad p_{T\,Z} = p_{T\,i}+p_{T\,Z}\qquad and\qquad m_{T\,Z}^{2} = \left(p_{t}^{\mu}+p_{Z}^{\mu}\right)^{2}\]

Figures 17,18 for \(\kappa_{Z}\) and 19 20 for \(\lambda_{Z}\) show the deviations of the expected distributions from the Standard Model predictions (including background) after all cuts.

Conclusion

The results obtain for both \(W\gamma\) and \(WZ\) production study shows that the ATLAS detector as the capability to detect anomalous coupling in the three boson vertices or to push the limits of theses anomalies up to less than 1% of accuracy for the most sensibles parameters.
