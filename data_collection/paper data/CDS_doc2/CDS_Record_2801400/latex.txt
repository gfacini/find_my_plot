## 1 Introduction

The top quark is the heaviest elementary particle of the Standard Model (SM). It has a large coupling to the SM Higgs boson and is predicted to have large couplings to hypothetical new particles in many models of physics beyond the Standard Model. Hence, studying processes involving the top quark is particularly important. The production of four top quarks (\(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\)) is a very rare process that is becoming accessible to the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC due to the large Run 2 LHC datasets. The expected cross section at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV is predicted to be \(\sigma(pp\to t\bar{t}t\bar{t})=16^{+18\%}_{-21\%}\) fb at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD including electroweak corrections [1], where the uncertainties represent variations of the renormalisation and factorisation scale choices. Many theories beyond the SM predict an enhancement of the \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) cross section; examples include gluino pair production in supersymmetric models [2], pair production of scalar gluons [3; 4], and production of a heavy pseudoscalar or scalar boson in association with a \(t\bar{t}\) pair in Type II two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM) [5; 6]. The \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) cross section is also sensitive to the magnitude and CP properties of the Yukawa coupling of the top quark to the Higgs boson since the \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) cross section includes a significant contribution from diagrams involving the splitting of an off-shell Higgs boson to top quark pairs [7; 8]. In the context of Effective Field Theories, the \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) cross section uniquely constrains the four top quark effective operators [9].

Four top quark production has been searched for with \(pp\) collision data at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV in final states that contain a same-sign lepton pair or at least three leptons by both CMS [10] and ATLAS, the former of which led to the first evidence for this process with an observed (expected) significance of 4.3 (2.4) using 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data [11]. The ATLAS and CMS experiments also performed searches in final states with one lepton or two oppositely charged leptons [12; 13].

After the end of Run 3, the LHC will be upgraded to the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), significantly increasing its instantaneous luminosity. The ATLAS detector will also be upgraded to maintain its performance in the higher luminosity environment and to mitigate the impact of radiation damage and detector ageing [14]. Even though the existing analyses are approaching the systematically-limited regime, the enormous HL-LHC datasets have great potential to allow more precise measurements of the \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) process via systematic uncertainty reduction.

This note presents the prospects for measuring the SM \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) cross section in the context of the HL-LHC with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV with the ATLAS experiment. The results presented here use events with two same-sign leptons or at least three leptons. Even though these channels have small branching fractions, they benefit from low levels of background and are expected to dominate the sensitivity of future \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) measurements. The studies are based on the extrapolation of the 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) results at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. The extrapolation is performed under two different scenarios of the evolution of detector performance and associated systematic uncertainties.

## 2 Summary of the 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) analysis at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV

In this section, an analysis of the full Run 2 ATLAS dataset that targeted the SM \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) process is summarized. The analysis uses the full 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) dataset at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV [11]. Events arising from \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) production are selected by exploiting the high multiplicities of light-flavour jets and heavy-flavour (\(b\)-tagged) jets as well as the large overall event activity. The event activity is probed by the scalar sum of the transverse momentum of the isolated leptons and jets, denoted by \(H_{\rm T}\). A signal region is defined by selecting events ifthey contain exactly two isolated leptons (electrons or muons) with the same electric charge or at least three isolated leptons. The leptons are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>28\GeV\), and these events are also required to have at least six jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\GeV\), among which at least two \(b\)-tagged jets with the 77% operating point [15], and \(H_{\mathrm{T}}\) above \(500\GeV\).

Several SM processes can produce events with topologies similar to those of \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) events. The dominant source of these backgrounds is \(t\bar{t}\) production with jets and other particles, such as a Higgs boson (\(t\bar{t}H\)+jets), \(W\) boson (\(t\bar{t}W\)+jets), or \(Z\) boson (\(t\bar{t}Z\)+jets). Significant backgrounds also come from events in which one of the leptons is reconstructed with an incorrect charge and from events that contain leptons arising from heavy-flavour decays, photon conversions or misidentified jets, the latter three being collectively referred to as "fake/non-prompt". The heavy-flavour decays are the dominant source for non-prompt muons, while the other sources mostly affect electrons. The charge misassignment and fake/non-prompt background come mainly from \(t\bar{t}\) events.

The backgrounds from \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets, \(t\bar{t}Z\)+jets and \(t\bar{t}H\)+jets processes are dominated by events produced in association with additional \(b\)-jets. These are evaluated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation normalised assuming the SM cross sections, except \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets for which the normalisation is corrected using data in a dedicated control region. The alternative treatment for the \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets background is motivated by the effect of missing electroweak corrections [16] in the MC simulation as well as by the large \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets background normalisation factor found in recent measurements in a similar phase space [17]. Similar to the \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets background, the fake/non-prompt background is evaluated using the so-called template method. It relies on the MC simulation to model the kinematic distributions and on control regions to determine their normalisations using data. The normalisation factors (NF), denoted as follows, are determined together with the signal strength: \(\mathrm{NF}_{\mathrm{HF}\ e}\) (\(\mathrm{NF}_{\mathrm{HF}\ \mu}\)) for the non-prompt electron (muon) background from heavy-flavour decays, \(\mathrm{NF}_{\mathrm{Mat.\ Conv.}}\) for the background events arising from photon conversion taking place in the detector material, \(\mathrm{NF}_{\mathrm{Low}\ m_{\gamma^{*}}}\) for events with a virtual photon leading to an \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pair, and \(\mathrm{NF}_{\mathrm{\it}W}\) for the \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets contribution.

The charge misassignment background only affects the channel with two leptons. It arises mainly from \(t\bar{t}\)+jets events with an opposite-charge lepton pair in which the charge of one electron is mismeasured either due to a bremsstrahlung photon emission followed by its conversion or due to a mismeasured track curvature. This background is evaluated using a data-driven method.

In the signal region, signal events are separated from background events using a multivariate discriminant by combining several input observables into a boosted decision tree (BDT). A binned likelihood fit is then performed on the distribution of the BDT score. The background-enriched control regions are also added to the fit to determine the normalisations of the \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets background and of some sources of fake/non-prompt background. The systematic uncertainties in both the signal and background predictions are included as nuisance parameters in the likelihood function.

The best-fit value of the signal strength \(\mu\), defined as the ratio of the measured \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) cross section to the SM expectation, is found to be:

\[\mu_{t\bar{t}t\bar{t}}=2.0\pm 0.4(\mathrm{stat})\,^{+0.7}_{-0.4}(\mathrm{syst})=2.0\,^{+0.8}_{-0.6}.\]

This fitted signal strength is converted into an inclusive cross section measurement using the SM \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) predicted cross section of \(\sigma_{t\bar{t}t\bar{t}}=12.0\pm 2.4\) fb computed at NLO in QCD and electroweak couplings [1] and excluding its uncertainty. The measured \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) cross section is then:

\[\sigma_{t\bar{t}t\bar{t}}=24\pm 5(\mathrm{stat})\,^{+5}_{-4}(\mathrm{syst})\, \mathrm{fb}=24\,^{+7}_{-6}\,\mathrm{fb}.\]The significance of the observed signal is found to be 4.3 standard deviations, while 2.4 standard deviations are expected. The normalisation factors of the different background sources determined from the fit, as shown in Table 1, are compatible with 1.0 except for the \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets background, which is found to be \(1.6\pm 0.3\). This is in agreement with the observation from the previous ATLAS \(t\bar{t}H\) search [17].

The largest systematic uncertainty impacting \(\mu\) comes from the modelling of the \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets process. This uncertainty is set to 125% (300%) for \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets production with seven (eight or more) jets. These values correspond to the difference between data and prediction in a \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets validation region where a data excess is observed for high jet multiplicities. The post-fit value of the nuisance parameter associated with the systematic uncertainty in the \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets background with \(N_{\rm jets}=7\) is \(0.18^{+0.73}_{-0.61}\). This corresponds to a 22% increase in the number of \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets events with seven jets and to a post-fit reduction of this systematic uncertainty from 125% to 90%. The post-fit value of the nuisance parameter for the systematic uncertainty of the \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets background with \(N_{\rm jets}\geq 8\) is \(0.22^{+0.56}_{-0.42}\). This corresponds to a 65% increase in the number of \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets events with eight or more jets, and a post-fit reduction of this systematic uncertainty from 300% to 170%. Apart from these uncertainties, no other nuisance parameters are found to be significantly adjusted or constrained by the fit. The uncertainties impacting \(\mu\) are summarised in Table 2.

A cross check of the main fit is performed by splitting the signal region into five regions according to the number of leptons and \(b\)-tagged jets, and fitting the \(H_{\rm T}\) distribution in each region. The BDT score is therefore not used in this check. The five regions are defined as follows: (i) events with two same-sign leptons and exactly two \(b\)-tagged jets (SR2b2l), (ii) events with at least three leptons and exactly two \(b\)-tagged jets (SR3b2l), (iii) events with two same-sign leptons and exactly three \(b\)-tagged jets (SR3b2l), (iv) events with at least three leptons and exactly three \(b\)-tagged jets (SR3b3l) and (v) events with at least four \(b\)-tagged jets (SR4b).

The observed (expected) significance from this cross check is found to be 4.3 (2.1) and the fitted signal strength is \(2.2^{+0.9}_{-0.6}\). This result is consistent with the result from the default fit. The values for the fitted background normalisation factors are also compatible. As this framework is more reliable to extrapolate than the result using the BDT score, this fit setup is used for the extrapolation studies presented in the following.

## 3 Extrapolation studies

The extrapolation from the 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) analysis at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV to the expectation with a 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) dataset for the HL-LHC is performed with the setup that uses \(H_{\rm T}\) as fitted variable in five signal regions. Results with intermediate luminosities, corresponding to 500, 1000 and 2000 fb\({}^{-1}\) are also considered. The signal and background expectations are scaled to an increased integrated luminosity and centre-of-mass energy. First, the predictions are scaled from 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) up to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). Next, the normalisation cross sections used to scale the different processes are changed to take into account the increase of centre-of-mass energy from 13 to 14 TeV. In particular, the signal cross section is increased by a factor of 1.3, while the \(t\bar{t}H\)+jets, \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets,

\end{table}
Table 2: List of the uncertainties in the signal strength \(\mu\) grouped in categories for the Run 2 analysis [11]. The total systematic uncertainty is determined by subtracting in quadrature the statistical uncertainty (obtained from a fit in which all the nuisance parameters are fixed to their post-fit values) from the total uncertainty. The total uncertainty is different from the sum in quadrature of the components due to correlations between nuisance parameters.

\(t\bar{t}W\)+jets and \(t\bar{t}\) cross sections are increased by a factor of 1.2. In addition, the normalisation factors of the different background sources determined from the fit in the 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) analysis (see Table 1) are applied to the \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets and fake/non-prompt backgrounds, assuming similar prompt lepton identification performance. Experimental and theoretical uncertainties are included in the extrapolation, following the prescriptions used in the 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) analysis, but the size of the uncertainties are scaled to account for possible reductions in their statistical components, potential improvements in analysis techniques associated with the larger available dataset [18, 19] or expected theoretical improvements. Two scenarios are explored. The first one, referred to as "Run 2", corresponds to the model closest to the 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) analysis, where all the systematic uncertainties are kept equal to their Run 2 values except for the \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets production with seven jets and with eight jets or more. The uncertainties associated with these events take into account the post-fit values of the corresponding nuisance parameters. The second model, referred to as "Run 2 Improved", still includes the scaling of \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets production from the previous model but also includes a decrease of the systematic uncertainties compared to the 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) analysis. A summary of the systematic uncertainty treatment in this model is given in Table 3. The uncertainties based on theoretical predictions are set to be half of those in the Run 2 analysis, assuming progress in theoretical computations and modelling [18]. This is applied to the \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets, \(t\bar{t}Z\)+jets, \(t\bar{t}H\)+jets, \(t\bar{t}t\) and signal modelling coming from cross section normalisation, scale variation, parton shower or parton distribution function (PDF) uncertainties. The uncertainties related to \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets and \(t\bar{t}Z\)+jets with heavy-flavour jets are scaled down according to the assumed luminosity since they were taken from a measurement of \(t\bar{t}\) production with additional heavy-flavour jets [20], and from comparisons between data and prediction in \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) events with three and four \(b\)-tagged jets. The instrumental uncertainties are assumed to be unchanged compared to the Run 2 values in the absence of detailed simulation studies of the upgraded detector [18]. This is not the case for the uncertainties in jet flavour tagging that are assumed to be half of those in the Run 2 analysis, following studies that show tagging uncertainty reductions due to improvements in data statistics, MC modelling, and methodology [18]. The uncertainty linked to the MC simulation sample size is assumed to be negligible. The uncertainties on \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets production with seven jets and with eight or more jets are scaled down with the constraints on the corresponding nuisance parameters observed in the 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) analysis.

The post-fit expected \(H_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions in the different signal regions are shown in Figure 1. The yields for the sum of the five signal regions in the case of the "Run 2 Improved" scenario are shown in Table 4. The expected significances for the \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) cross section, resulting from Asimov fits in the control and signal regions when assuming the two scenarios for scaling the systematic uncertainties, are presented in Table 5 and Figure 2(a). A significance of 4.2 (6.4) standard deviations for the SM process with respect to the background-only hypothesis is expected in the "Run 2" scenario ("Run 2 Improved" scenario, respectively). The total expected uncertainty on the cross section in the full phase space with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) is approximately 20% for the "Run 2" scenario and approximately 14% for the "Run 2 Improved" scenario, as shown in Figure 2(b). In the "Run 2" scenario, the expected experimental uncertainty reaches the current uncertainty on the SM theory cross section [1], while for the "Run 2 Improved" scenario, the experimental precision is expected to be significantly better than the precision of the current SM theory cross section. The improvement in sensitivity of the "Run 2 Improved" scenario compared to the "Run 2" scenario is driven by the smaller assumed uncertainty on the \(t\bar{t}t\) cross section, and by the smaller uncertainties related to \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets/\(t\bar{t}Z\)+jets with heavy-flavour jets and jet flavour tagging.

The list of expected uncertainties in the signal strength \(\mu\) for the "Run 2 Improved" scenario is shown in Table 6. Apart from the theoretical uncertainty on the signal cross section, the largest systematic uncertainties are expected to come from the modelling of the \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets process, the uncertainty on the light-flavour jet tagging and the jet uncertainties. Despite the lower input values for the uncertainties on \(t\bar{t}W\)+jets production with seven jets and with eight or more jets in the "Run 2 Improved" scenario,

## 4 Conclusion

The expected sensitivity of the measurement of the four top quark production cross section has been estimated for the ATLAS detector at the HL-LHC. The results obtained using a dataset of 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\)[11] have been extrapolated up to the 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) dataset expected to be collected at \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{TeV}\). Two scenarios are considered, with different assumptions on the scaling of the systematic uncertainties. The most optimistic scenario assumes that many pre-fit uncertainties can be halved due to

The uncertainty on the total yield is different from the sum in quadrature of the individual uncertainties due to the correlations between systematic uncertainties.

improvements in the theoretical calculations, auxiliary measurements, object identification calibrations on which current uncertainties are based, or scaled down according to the increased luminosity. The conservative extrapolation retains the size of the systematic uncertainties observed in the 139 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) analysis at \(\sqrt{s}=13\TeV\). In the most optimistic scenario, the expected significance with respect to the background-only hypothesis is expected to reach 6.4 standard deviations. In the more conservative scenario a significance of 4.2 standard deviations is expected. The total expected uncertainty on the four top quark production cross section ranges from 14% to 20%.
