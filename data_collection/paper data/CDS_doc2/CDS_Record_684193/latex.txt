Introduction

This work is devoted to study of the electron calibration of the cells of the ATLAS iron-scintillator tile barrel hadron calorimeter [1] on the basis of the August 2000 test beam period. We have used the exposition of the setup by the 100 GeV electron beam at \(\theta\) = 20\({}^{o}\). The results are compared with the CIS (charge injection system) [3] calibration data.

## 2 The setup

The setup is one production barrel Module on the bottom and two production extended barrel Modules on the top. The layout of the readout cell geometry for this setup is shown in Fig. 1.

The Modules have three depth segmentations. The thickness of the Module at \(\Theta\) = 0\({}^{o}\) is 1.5 \(\lambda\) in the first depth sampling, 4.2 \(\lambda\) in the second and 1.9 \(\lambda\) in the third with a total depth of 7.6 \(\lambda\).

## 3 Event Selection

The following 4 cuts were used [2]. The cuts 1 removed beam halo. The cut 2 removed muons. The two cuts carried out the electron-pion separation, rejected pions in electron runs and electron in pion runs. Cut 3 is the relative shower energy deposition in the first two calorimeter depths:

\[C_{i}\,=\,\sum_{selected\,\,i}\,\,\,\sum_{j=3}\sum_{k\,=1}^{2}\sum_{l=1}^{2}\,E _{ijk\,l}/E_{beam}\,\,. \tag{1}\]

The indexes \(i\) and \(k\) in \(E_{ijkl}\) determine the regions of electromagnetic shower development. The cut 4 is related with the lateral shower spread

\[E_{cut}=\frac{\sqrt{\sum_{c}(E_{c}^{\alpha}-\sum_{c}E_{c}^{\alpha}/N_{cell})^ {2}}}{\sum_{c}E_{c}^{\alpha}}\,\,, \tag{2}\]

where \(1\leq c\leq N_{cell}\), \(N_{cell}\) is the used cells number, \(\alpha\) = 0.6. Due to application of these cuts electrons are clearly separated.

Electron Response

The electron response is a function of \(E_{beam}\), \(\Theta\) and \(Z\). The energy response spectrum for given run (beam has the transversal spread \(\pm 20\) mm) as a rule is non-Gaussian. The mean values (parameter \(P_{2}\)) and the amplitudes (parameter \(P_{1}\)) of such spectra as a function of the impact point \(Z\) coordinate have been extracted by fitting the sine function:

\[f(Z)=P_{2}+P_{1}\sin\,\left(2\pi Z/P_{3}+P_{4}\right)\,. \tag{3}\]

Fig. 2 shows the mean relative electron response (\(R_{e}=E_{e}/E_{beam}\)) as a function of the cell number. As can be seen these calibration coefficients are in the range of about \(1.06\div 1.15\). The spread does not exceed \(\pm 3\%\).

Fig. 3 shows the normalized electron responses and the CIS responses for up and down photomultipliers. There is no correlation between these responses.

Fig. 4 shows the distribution of cells as a function of the mean relative electron response. The mean value of this distribution, an absolute energy scale \((pCb\to GeV)\), is \(1.102\pm 0.009\) and RMS is \(0.027\pm 0.006\).
