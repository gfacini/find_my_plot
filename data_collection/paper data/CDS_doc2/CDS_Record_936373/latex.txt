**Abstract**

This note describes the performance obtained by applying the track seeded electron algorithm to Rome data. The algorithm is used on \(WH\), \(H\to b\bar{b}\), \(u\bar{u}\) and \(J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events. As examples of application of the electron identification, the related soft-electron \(b\)-tagging performance are given as well as the reconstruction of the \(J/\psi\) invariant mass. The analysis is performed on both AOD and CBNT.

Introduction

The identification and use of low transverse momentum (\(p_{T}<20\) GeV/\(c\)) electrons, using a track seeded algorithm, was studied with DC1 data in [1] and [2]. This note presents an update of these studies based on the Rome data, and thus minimal information will be provided. Application of soft electron identification for \(b\)-tagging and \(J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}\) mass reconstruction is shown. The analysis is performed at both CBNT and AOD.

The note is organised as follows. Data samples used in this analysis are described in section 2. The performance of the electron identification procedure is given in section 3. Finally the soft-electron \(b\)-tagging performance is given in section 4 and the \(J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}\) mass reconstruction in section 5.

## 2 Data samples

The samples contain events from Higgs-boson associated production, \(WH\) with \(W\to\mu\nu\), \(m_{H}=120\) GeV/\(c^{2}\). The signal sample consists of \(H\to b\bar{b}\) events and the background sample of \(H\to u\bar{u}\) events. A sample of \(H\to b\bar{b}\) filtered for electrons at the generation level allows for enriched statistics of electrons for performance studies. It is used only to build the probability density functions (PDFs) during the identification procedure. The preselection cuts for that sample are the same as in [1].

To study \(J/\psi\) mass reconstruction two samples of \(bB_{d}\to\mu(6)J/\psi(e^{+}e^{-})K_{S}(\pi^{+}\pi^{-})\) events have been prepared: one with a minimum \(p_{T}\) threshold of 2 GeV/\(c\) applied to the generated electrons (018100), the second one with a 1 GeV/\(c\) (018102) threshold.

The samples were simulated and digitised with Athena release 10.0.12. No pile-up events were added to studied samples. The \(WH\) data were reconstructed using Athena release 11.0.3. The \(J/\psi\) data were reconstructed with release 11.0.41. Only tracks, reconstructed using xKalman, with transverse momentum \(p_{T}>2\) GeV/\(c\) and \(|\eta|\leq 2.0\), where the TRT is present, are kept for analysis. In order to reject contribution from badly reconstructed or fake tracks, the following quantities are used to select _good quality_ tracks:

Footnote 1: The \(\mu(6)\) refers to a muon coming from \(b\) quark with a \(p_{T}\) above 6 GeV/\(c\) to trigger at level 1 (for this note at the generation level).

Footnote 2: Samples 018198 and 018199 are re-simulated from the official Rome datasets 004860 and 004861, which were simulated with release 9.0.4 which had a problem in the TRT simulation.

* at least two hits in the pixel detector, one of them in the \(B\)-layer;
* at least nine precision hits (pixels + SCT);

As the TRT transition radiation information is crucial for the studies presented, two further selection criteria are applied:

* at least 20 hits in the TRT detector along the track;
* at least one high energy hit (TR hit) in the TRT detector along the track.

## 3 Electron identification

The soft-electron reconstruction and identification algorithm is performed within the _gammaRec_ package in the Athena framework. Details on its implementation and performance on DC1 data can be found in [1].

All the _good quality_ tracks are extrapolated to the electromagnetic calorimeter. Compared to previous studies, the main changes in the algorithm concern the clustering: a \(5\times 5\) cluster is created around the extrapolated position in the second sampling. The energy corrections defined for the standard \(5\times 5\) sliding window are applied on the soft-electron clusters. Candidates with a ratio of energy reconstructed in EM Calo over momentum reconstructed in the tracker \(E/p<0.4\) are rejected and not considered as soft-electron candidates. They are however included in the calculation of the overall performance. Finally a set of discriminating variables is defined based on the transverse and longitudinal shapes of the electromagnetic showers, track information in the Inner Detector (ID), ID-Calo matching in position and energy, and transition radiation information.

The first method to identify electrons is based on the use of a likelihood ratio; the second is based on the use of a neural network. Both methods, described in detail in [1], start from the distribution of the discriminating variables for the signal and for the background. For the PDF preparation as well as for training the neural network, we use the signal sample filtered for electrons and part of the background \(H\to u\bar{u}\) samples. For the \(J/\psi\) samples, the sample 018102 was used for PDF preparation and the sample 018100 for performance check3. The histograms of the discriminating variables are treated as probability density functions (PDFs). As was shown in [1], the variables show a significant dependence on the pseudorapidity and the separation between the distributions obtained for electrons and pions can vary with \(\eta\). Therefore PDFs are prepared for 5 \(\eta\) bins: (0, 0.8); (0.8, 1.35); (1.35, 1.5); (1.5, 1.8); (1.8, 2.0)4. For the study of the \(J/\psi\) sample the crack is not taken into account in the analysis.

Footnote 3: The official background sample of \(b\bar{b}\to\mu 6X\) events was not available for these studies as there was a problem with TRT simulation.

Footnote 4: One should notice that compared to DC1 studies, the (1.35, 1.5) bin has been added corresponding to the crack region in the electromagnetic calorimeter.

The identification of a candidate track as originating from a signal electron is based on the value of the chosen discriminating function assigned to the given track. The identification efficiency versus the rejection power of the algorithm is obtained by varying the value of the threshold on the value of this function. The electron identification efficiency is defined as a ratio of the number of reconstructed _good quality_ signal electron tracks in the signal samples "identified as an electron track" to the number of all reconstructed _good quality_ signal electron tracks in the signal samples. The charged pion rejection is defined as the ratio of the number of _good quality_ pion tracks to the number of _good quality_ pion tracks misidentified as a signal electron track.

The pion rejection factors obtained for an electron identification efficiency \(\varepsilon_{e}=80\%\) using the likelihood and the neural network method for 5 and 1 \(|\eta|\) bins are presented in Tab. 2 for the various data samples. Fig. 1 shows the rejection as a function of efficiency for various samples using the likelihood method in 5 \(|\eta|\) bins. Note that the electron identification efficiency of \(J/\psi\) events can reach higher values than in the WH samples. In the \(WH\) sample, electrons not being isolated, the \(E/p\) distribution shows larger tails at low values compared to the \(J/\psi\) sample. Thus the \(WH\) sample is more sensitive to the \(E/p>0.4\) cut. It has been checked that this cut does not affect performance for efficiencies lower than 90%.

As shown in Tab. 2, the rejection of pion tracks in \(H\to b\overline{b}\) is \(306\pm 17\), in \(H\to u\bar{u}\) is \(782\pm 89\) and in \(J/\psi\) is \(12000\pm 250\). Rejection of pion tracks is higher in the \(J/\psi\) sample than in the \(WH\) as electrons are rather well isolated in the former. The b hadron lifetimes are on the order of 1.6 ps (\(c\tau\simeq\) 0.48 mm). At LHC production energies, typically of the order of few tens of GeV, they travel a significant distance (some millimeters) inside the detector before decaying. Thus, the distributions of the impact parameter allows to

distinguish between tracks from the primary interactions (small \(A_{0}\)) from a B-particle decay (large \(A_{0}\)). This results in differences between pion rejection in different jets, in \(WH\) samples. Compared to the previous study (cf. [1] and [2]), performance is similar within the statistical errors. Improvement in the \(WH\) sample on rejection when working with 1 and 5 \(|\eta|\) bins is about 40%. No improvement is seen, within the statistical errors for the case of the \(J/\psi\) sample, due in part of the removal of the crack region in the analysis.

The neural network (NN) uses the same input variables as the method based on the likelihood ratio and is trained on the same data sample as the those used to produce the PDF distributions. A feed-forward network with logistic activation function and two hidden layers containing 10 nodes in each layer is chosen. The Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator [4] is used and the trained network can be included as a \(c\)-code function into the ATHENA framework.

For comparison with the likelihood ratio analysis in 5 \(|\eta|\) bins the absolute value of pseudorapidity \(|\eta|\) was added as the 9th NN training variable. This results in an improvement in background rejection. The rejection of pion tracks using the neural network method while using \(|\eta|\) as a discriminating variable is in \(H\to b\bar{b}\) is \(217\pm 10\) and in \(H\to u\bar{u}\) is \(1255\pm 181\). The use of the neural network gives \(\sim 60\%\) gain in the pion rejection in \(H\to u\bar{u}\) sample over the likelihood-ratio method for a signal detection efficiency of 80%. The effect is even stronger for higher signal efficiencies (see Fig. 2 where the neural network performance is compared with the likelihood ratio method for 5 \(\eta\) bins). In contrast to the PDF ratio approach, the neural network explores the correlations between variables, which is reflected in the higher background rejection.

The rejection of pions from \(H\to b\bar{b}\) using the NN is slightly lower than for the PDF likelihood-ratio method. As detailed previously the transverse impact parameter \(A_{0}\) is different for light and b-jets. The neural network being trained with pions from \(H\to u\bar{u}\) only, it is therefore not optimized to reject pions from \(H\to b\bar{b}\).

Soft-electron \(b\)-tagging

The soft-electron \(b\)-tagging method complements the secondary vertex tagging via its sensitivity to leptonic \(b\)-decays. The branching ratio of \(B\)-meson decays to leptons is about 10.5% per lepton. The soft-electron \(b\)-tagging algorithm is part of the general \(b\)-tagging package _JetTagging_ implemented in the ATHENA framework [3]. The method is based on the electron-identification procedure:

* for each track in the jet the value of the discriminating function for electron identification, \(D_{\rm track}\), is calculated using one of two methods, likelihood ratio or Neural Network as discribed in the previous section.
* for each jet, the track with the highest value of \(D_{\rm track}\) is chosen and its value is taken as the value of the discriminating function for the jet, \(D_{\rm jet}~{}=~{}{\rm max}(D_{\rm track})\);
* for a given threshold \(D_{\rm jet}^{\rm thr}\), a jet with \(D_{\rm jet}\geq D_{\rm jet}^{\rm thr}\) is tagged as a \(b\)-jet.

The soft-electron identification using the likelihood ratio and the neural network are performed with \(\eta\) bin optimisation as described above. Jets are reconstructed with the cone algorithm (\(\Delta R=0.4\)) and labeled as originating from a \(b\), \(c\)-quark, if a \(b\)- or \(c\)-quark in the MC truth with \(p_{T}^{b/c}>5\) GeV/\(c\) (after FSR) is found in a cone \(\Delta R=0.3\) around the jet axis. The efficiency of the \(b\)-tagging algorithm is defined as the ratio of the number of the tagged \(b\)-jets to the number of labeled \(b\)-jets with at least one electron with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV/\(c\) after _good quality_ cuts inside the jet cone.

The jet rejection factor is the ratio of the number of jets from the \(H\to u\bar{u}\) sample (without jets labeled by heavy flavors) with at least one _good quality_ track with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV/\(c\) inside the jet cone to the number of those jets tagged as \(b\)-jets.

Figure 3: _Jet rejection, \(R_{\rm jet}\), for \(u\)-jets as a function of the \(b\)-tagging algorithm efficiency, \(\varepsilon_{b}^{\rm alg}\), obtained with the likelihood ( 5 \(|\eta|\) bins) [squares] and the neural network (\(|\eta|\) as NN input) [triangles] methods. The errors are statistical only._

Fig. 3 shows the rejection factors for \(u\)-jets as a function of the \(b\)-tagging algorithm efficiency for both methods, the likelihood ratio and the neural network. The gain from using a neural network can be seen only for high efficiencies of \(b\)-tagging (see Fig. 3) when background jets are tagged mainly by pions. For 90% tagging efficiency of signal jets the neural network gives the \(51\pm 1\) rejection of background jets while the likelihood algorithm \(40\pm 1\). For low efficiencies, when jets are tagged mainly by background electrons, no improvement from the neural network method giving better pion rejection can be observed and both tagging methods are giving similar performance. For 60% \(b\)-tagging efficiency the likelihood method gives the \(145\pm 6\) rejection of \(u\)-jets.

## 5 Reconstruction of J/\(\psi\) events

The reconstruction of J/\(\psi\) events is performed using the code implemented in ATHENA in the BPhysExamples package [5] at the AOD level with an algorithm similar to the one described in [2]. The electron identification efficiency is set to 90%. We note that for this study, about ten times less events have been produced than in the previous analysis which was focused on the calibration of the electromagnetic calorimeter. In this note we simply want to check the identification performance and the invariant mass reconstruction obtained with Rome data.

Pairs of electron candidate tracks are obtained. These pairs are close to each other as expect (mean distance \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\) 1 as shown in [2]). Pairs of opposite-charge tracks are fitted to a common vertex. Successful fits (\(\chi^{2}\)/d.o.f\(<6\)) are retained. The fitted transverse decay length of the reconstructed \(J/\psi\) is required to be greater then 250 \(\mu m\). Fig. 4 shows the electron pair invariant mass distribution from the Inner Detector (ID) information only (left) and when using the Liquid Argon Electromagnetic Calorimeter (LArEM) for the energy reconstruction (right). The fitted function is an asymmetric gaussian with different widths, \(\sigma_{\rm left}\), and \(\sigma_{\rm right}\), either side of the fitted peak mass \(m_{0}\). The parameter \(\sigma_{\rm right}\) characterises the effective resolution in the invariant mass, while \(\sigma_{\rm left}\) is a measure of the deterioration of this resolution due to bremsstrahlung. The fit is performed in a narrow mass interval, between 2.85 and 3.15 GeV/\(c^{2}\) for the ID only case and between 2.7 and 3.5 GeV/\(c^{2}\) when using the LArEM. The fitted values of the parameters \(\Delta m_{0}=m_{0}-M_{J/\psi}\), where \(M_{J/\Psi}=3096\) MeV/\(c^{2}\) is the nominal J/\(\psi\) mass, \(\sigma_{\rm left}\) and \(\sigma_{\rm right}\) are shown in Tab. 3. When using the ID only, results are in agreement with those obtained in [2]. In particular the shift of \(-46\) MeV/\(c^{2}\) was already seen. When

Figure 4: _The electron pair invariant mass for J/\(\psi\) signal events with reconstruction in the ID only (left) and using only the energy from the LArEM (right)._

using the LArEM for the energy reconstruction the reconstructed \(J/\psi\) mass is shifted by \(\sim 90\) MeV/\(c^{2}\) which is about two times more than in [2].

In Fig. 5 the ratio between reconstructed and true energy and the same ratio as a function of \(|\eta|\) for signal electrons from \(J/\psi\) samples (top) and for single elctrons of 25 GeV5 (bottom) are presented. As described in section 3, the standard \(5\times 5\) sliding window corrections are applied to the energy reconstruction in the Athena. These corrections are well tuned for the single electron sample but not for the electrons from \(J/\psi\) for which

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(\Delta m_{0}\) & \(\sigma_{\rm left}\) & \(\sigma_{\rm right}\) \\  & \(MeV/c^{2}\) & \(MeV/c^{2}\) & \(MeV/c^{2}\) \\ \hline ID & \(-46.4\pm 4.9\) & \(135.1\pm 7.8\) & \(37.0\pm 2.8\) \\ ID/LArEM & \(88.6\pm 14.2\) & \(243.4\pm 12.0\) & \(212.0\pm 16.2\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

the reconstructed energy is overestimated. The optimisation of the energy corrections was performed primarly at a higher energy scale, _i.e._ Z mass. Therefore it is not optimal at lower energies and in the future improvements are expected.

## 6 Conclusion

In this note the soft-electron reconstruction and \(b\)-tagging results are discussed. The performance is detailed on the samples \(WH\), \(H\to b\overline{b}\), \(u\overline{u}\) and on a sample of \(J/\psi\) events produced during the ATLAS Rome Monte Carlo production. Compared to previous studies the main changes in the algorithm concern the clustering in the electromagnetic calorimeter as well as energy corrections now applied at Athena level. Thus, identification performance of soft-electrons and related \(b\)-tagging are similar to those obtained previously. To deal with non-linear dependencies between the discriminating variables, a neural network method is used to obtain the optimal performance. It gives \(\sim 60\%\) improvement in the pion rejection from \(H\to u\overline{u}\) for \(80\%\) signal detection efficiency and even better improvement for higher signal efficiencies compared to a likelihood ratio method. Using this method for \(b\)-tagging purposes, a gain can be observed only for high \(b\)-tagging algorithm efficiencies. Concerning the energy reconstruction, it is shown in the \(J/\psi\) sample that the energy reconstruction should be improved significantly by adding lower energy samples to the longitudinal weights determination.
