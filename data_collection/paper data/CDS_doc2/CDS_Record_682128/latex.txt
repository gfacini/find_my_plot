**Study of \(\rm H\to WW\to\ell\nu jj\) and \(\rm H\to ZZ\to\ell\bar{\nu}jj\)**

**decays for \(\rm m_{H}=1\) TeV**

This note presents a study of \(\rm H\to WW\to\ell\nu jj\) and \(\rm H\to ZZ\to\ell\bar{\nu}jj\) decays for \(\rm m_{H}=1\) TeV, for Higgs boson production through WW(ZZ) fusion. The main focal points of the study are the impact of the central calorimeter design parameters on the reconstruction of high-\(\rm p_{T}\) W(Z) \(\to jj\) decays and of the forward calorimeter design parameters on the quality of jet tagging. Pile-up effects are also systematically studied and the resulting performance in extracting the Higgs signal from the background is discussed.

Introduction

The nature of the electroweak symmetry-breaking mechanism is a fundamental question of contemporary high energy physics. The experimental search for the neutral Higgs boson, the relic of electroweak symmetry breaking in the Standard Model (SM), presents a major challenge. Since the mass of the Higgs boson is not predicted, the search must extend to the unitarity bound, corresponding to \(\mathrm{m_{H}}=1~{}\mathrm{TeV}\). If \(\mathrm{m_{H}}>1~{}\mathrm{TeV}\), \(\mathrm{W_{L}W_{L}}\) scattering would become non-perturbative and tree-level unitarity would be violated.

This note presents a study of the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\to\bar{\nu}\mathrm{jj}\) channel for a heavy Higgs boson of 1 TeV mass. The main reason for studying this channel is that the branching ratio is about 150 times larger than BR (\(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}\to\bar{\nu}\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}\)), thus leading to the largest possible rate with at least one charged lepton in the final state. The channel \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}\to\bar{\nu}\mathrm{jj}\) is also studied here, although it suffers from a 7 times lower rate.

The main production mechanisms for a 1 TeV Higgs boson are gluon fusion and vector boson fusion, which is dominated by \(\mathrm{W_{L}W_{L}}\) fusion and contains a much smaller \(\mathrm{Z_{L}Z_{L}}\) contribution. In this study we consider only the vector boson fusion mechanism, \(\mathrm{qq}\to\mathrm{qqH}\), since we will show that the reconstruction of the two final state quark jets (tag jets) provides a good handle to extract the signal from the various backgrounds.

These backgrounds are dominated by W+jet production, containing two jets with invariant mass close to \(\mathrm{M_{W}}\), and \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{W}\overline{ \mathrm{b}}\to\bar{\nu}\mathrm{jj}+\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\). Both these backgrounds are of the same order of magnitude and almost two orders of magnitude larger than the background from continuum WW production. In the first part of this study, we consider only the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background, which has been shown to be the most dangerous one in previous studies.

The first part of this study concentrates on the reconstruction of the events in the central region (\(\eta\)\(|<2\)-\(2.5\)). Particular attention is given to the reconstruction of the W mass, using the two highly boosted, narrow, overlapping jets resulting from the decay of these high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) W's, in the presence of pile-up. The impact of the granularity and resolution of the calorimeter on the efficiency for reconstructing these jets is also investigated.

The second part of this study concerns jet-tagging in the forward region. The performance requirements for the forward calorimeters are investigated and the impact of pile-up is also studied. Finally, the signal and background are compared after all cutshave been applied. The search for high-mass boson pairs at LHC will certainly be a challenging topic.

## II Study of central region

### Optimisation of kinematic cuts using parton level studies

For \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\) = 1 TeV, the production cross-section, \(\sigma(\mathrm{qq}\rightarrow\mathrm{Hqq})\), is 0.16 pb and \(\mathrm{BR(H\to WW)}\) = 0.63. With an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) and a lepton efficiency of 90%, 2684 signal events are produced in one LHC year. For \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\rightarrow\mathrm{WbW\overline{b}}\), the production cross-section is 3500 pb, for \(\mathrm{m_{t}}\) = 140 GeV, and the number of \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events produced per year is \(\sim\) 1.09 \(\times\)\(10^{8}\). Fortunately this large number of background events can be reduced greatly by simple kinematic cuts, applied to the transverse momentum of the lepton (neutrino), \(\mathrm{p_{T}}^{\mathrm{V}}\), to that of the W decaying into jets, \(\mathrm{p_{T}}^{\mathrm{Wjj}}\), or into lepton+neutrino, \(\mathrm{p_{T}}^{\mathrm{Wlv}}\), and to the invariant mass of the WW system, \(\mathrm{m_{WW}}\). Using the W-mass constraint, the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino, and hence the invariant mass of the WW system, can be calculated.

Figures 1 and 2 show the distribution of \(\mathrm{P_{T}}^{\mathrm{1}}\), for the signal and the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background. For \(\mathrm{p_{T}}^{\mathrm{Wjj}}\) > 300 GeV and \(\mathrm{m_{WW}}\) > 800 GeV, the significance of the Higgs signal over the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background, S/\(\backslash\)B, can be optimised as a function of the threshold on \(\mathrm{p_{T}}^{\mathrm{1}}\), as shown in Fig. 3. The value of S/\(\backslash\)B remains more or less constant over a region from 50 to 150 GeV, but falls rapidly for higher values of the threshold. This has led us to choose a threshold of 100 GeV for \(\mathrm{p_{T}}^{\mathrm{1}}\)(and \(\mathrm{p_{T}}^{\mathrm{V}}\)).

Figures 4 and 5 show the distributions of \(\mathrm{P_{T}}^{\mathrm{Wjj}}\) for signal and background after applying the above cut on \(\mathrm{p_{T}}^{\mathrm{1}}\). As in fig. 3, fig. 6 shows the optimisation of S/\(\backslash\)B as a function of \(\mathrm{p_{T}}^{\mathrm{Wjj}}\). The best values are obtained in the 300 to 400 GeV region and a cut, \(\mathrm{p_{T}}^{\mathrm{Wjj}}\) > 350 GeV, was chosen. Finally figs. 7 and 8 show the distributions of \(\mathrm{m_{WW}}\), for signal and background, and fig. 9 shows how S/\(\backslash\)B varies as a function of \(\mathrm{m_{WW}}\). The cuts chosen for the \(\mathrm{W\to jj}\) reconstruction studies presented below are therefore:

\[\mathrm{m_{WW}} > 850\;\mathrm{GeV}\] \[\mathrm{p_{T}}^{\mathrm{Wjj}} > 350\;\mathrm{GeV}\] \[\mathrm{p_{T}}^{\mathrm{1}} > 100\;\mathrm{GeV}\]

After these parton level cuts, the remaining Higgs boson signal would consist of 1146 events, and the remaining background from \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) of 64516 events. This leads to an expected S/\(\backslash\)B = \(4.51\pm 0.16\), an obviously optimistic value, which we shall now proceed to refine, using a detector simulation. We shall also discuss other possible kinematic cuts in Section III.

### Jet reconstruction in the central region

In the reconstruction of the signal, an accurate mass reconstruction of high-Pt W's is one of the most important steps. The algorithm chosen should optimize the mass resolution and must be efficient at finding two nearly overlapping jets. The requirement of finding the two jets eliminates QCD W + 1 jet background, which is approximately 10 times larger than the W + 2 jet background. Pile-up effects and a possible coarse granularity of the hadronic calorimeter must also be taken into consideration.

To simulate the calorimeter, particle energies are deposited in a grid with energy smearing, \(\Delta\)E/E = 50%/E \(\oplus\) 2%, and a granularity of (0.05 \(\times\) 0.05) in (\(\phi\),\(\eta\)) space, where \(\phi\) and \(\eta\) denote the azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity. The impact of variations of this granularity on the mass resolution is studied below. A fairly standard jet algorithm then finds the cell with the highest transverse energy, ET, provided it is larger than 5 GeV, uses this cell to define the axis of the jet and collects all the energy in a cone around the cell to estimate the jet energy. If the transverse energy of the jet is larger than a given threshold, usually set to 50 GeV in this study, the jet is retained as a central jet. The process continues over all unused cells, until no seed cell is left. An optimum cone size, \(\Delta\)R = \(\sqrt{(\Delta\phi)^{2}+(\Delta\eta)^{2}}\) = 0.2, was chosen, since the jets from high-pt W-decay are very close to each other in space. The energies of cells belonging to more than 1 jet are distributed in proportion to the jet energies. The electron jet is singled out and removed from the list of jets. If we require the presence of two reconstructed jets and one electron in the central region, 67.2% of Higgs events and 40.3% of \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) events survive, for \(|\eta|<2.5\).

The masses of all dijet combinations are then calculated, and the combination with mass closest to the W mass is chosen. The mass resolution is considerably improved by collecting the energy from all cells in a larger cone, centred on the reconstructed W direction. To compute the mass of the system, cells inside the larger cone are treated as massless 4-vectors and summed. The results are illustrated, for various big cone sizes, in Tables 1 (no pile-up) and 2 (with pile-up from 40 minimum bias events).

From these Tables we can draw several conclusions :

a) Whereas a cut of \(\pm\) 10 GeV around the W-mass would conserve most of the signal in the absence of pile-up, Table 2 shows that the mass resolution is considerably worse once pile-up effects are included, increasing to about 7 GeV.

* If only cells with transverse energy above a fixed threshold of 1 to 3 GeV are used, Table 2 shows that the mass resolution becomes much less sensitive to pile-up effects, and that it is considerably better than that obtained using all cells (first column).
* A cone size of about 0.5 is therefore chosen as the optimum and Figs. 10 and 11 show the expected mass resolutions for the various cases discussed above. Figure 10 shows that, the chosen granularity of \(0.05\times 0.05\) in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\), the W-mass can be reconstucted with a resolution slightly better than 5 GeV, for a cone size \(\Delta\)R = 0.5 in the absence of pile-up (black circles). In the presence of an average pile-up of 40 minimum bias events (open circles), the resolution degrades considerably, especially for large cone sizes. Fig. 11 shows that this sensitivity to pile-up can be greatly reduced by considering only cells with E\({}_{\rm T}\) larger than 3 GeV (see also Table 2). The distribution of the reconstructed dijet mass for the Higgs signal is shown in Fig. 12 (no pile-up) and Fig. 13 (with pile-up and E\({}_{\rm T}^{\rm cell}\) cut). The combinatorial background is low and the E\({}_{\rm T}^{\rm cell}\) cut used for Fig. 13 effectively compensates for the extra energy introduced by pile-up and the dijet mass peaks close to mw.

Finally Fig. 14 shows the same distribution for the \(\rm t\overline{t}\) background, where the peak is found to be much broader, due to the extra confusion created by the presence of the nearby b-quark jet from top decay. A fraction of the events are even found to peak near the top quark mass of 140 GeV.

### Effect of calorimeter resolution

The impact of the overall calorimeter resolution on the accuracy for reconstructing mw is smaller than that of the granularity discussed above. For example, with a granularity of \(0.05\times 0.05\) and a pile-up of 20 minimum bias events, the mass resolution for \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\mathrm{jj}\) decays varies from 4.7 GeV for a perfect calorimeter, to 5.6 GeV for a resolution of 50%/\(\mathrm{NE}\oplus 2\%\) and to 6.4 GeV for a resolution of 100%/\(\mathrm{NE}\oplus 5\%\).

We conclude that the impact of the calorimeter performance on the resolution of these high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\)\(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\mathrm{jj}\) decays is important enough in terms of granularity and possibly resolution, even at the highest LHC luminosities, that it warrants futher more detailed detector simulations. For the present note, we shall assume that a cut, \(\mathrm{m_{jj}}=\mathrm{mw}\pm 15\) GeV is safe enough to collect most of the Higgs signal events. The mass window allowed by this cut is obviously directly related to the amount of \(\mathrm{W}+\mathrm{jet}\) background which will be accepted as signal.

## III Study of jet tagging in forward calorimeters

In the following, we describe an independent study, for \(\mathrm{m_{H}}=1\) TeV, mainly focussed on jet tagging, with slightly different central cuts and a more systematic approach towards rejecting the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background and also other background sources. Section III.1 describes briefly the central cuts used in this analysis, both for \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\ell\nu\mathrm{jj}\) and \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\mathrm{ZZ}\rightarrow\ell\nu\mathrm{jj}\) decays, which are claimed to provide a more promising signal in the CMS LoI. Section III.2 is devoted to jet tagging, in terms of

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

As shown in Table 6, the above cuts are somewhat better than the cuts described in Section II, at separating the Higgs signal from the various background sources, since the overall significance expected after the central cuts is \(\sim 3.3\), including approximately equal contributions from \(\mathrm{\overline{t}}\) and W + jet events. This is due partially to the choice of the cut, \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{W\to\ell\nu}}>350\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\), rather than the cut \(\mathrm{m_{WW}}>850\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\), and to a more refined jet algorithm.

As expected, the significance of the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{ZZ}\to\ell\ell\mathrm{jj}\) signal is worse (\(\sim 1.7\)), due to the much lower signal rate. We also note that, as discussed many times in the past [3], the backgrounds from vector boson pairs are negligible compared to the QCD backgrounds.

It has been suggested repeatedly, that a veto cut on additional jets in the central region may greatly reduce the \(\mathrm{\overline{t}}\) background. It seems that some of the results quoted in the past [4], were too optimistic because they used parton-level Monte-Carlo simulations, which did not include initial and final state radiation, nor hadronisation. We have therefore performed such a study, with particular attention paid to pile-up effects which may significantly affect the efficiency of such a veto cut.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{WW}\to\ell\nu\mathrm{jj}\) & \(\mathrm{\overline{t}}\) & \(\mathrm{W}\) + jets & \(\mathrm{WW}\) & \(\mathrm{WZ}\) \\  & & (\(\mathrm{p_{T}^{LO}>300\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\)) & (\(\mathrm{p_{T}^{W}>100\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\)) & (\(\mathrm{p_{T}^{W}>325\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\)) & (\(\mathrm{p_{T}^{W}>325\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\)) \\ \hline Production cross-section (pb) & 0.16 & 60 & 3040 & 0.16 & 0.06 \\ \hline Events per \(\mathrm{\overline{t}}\) & 2684 & 1.6 10\({}^{6}\) & 5.9 10\({}^{7}\) & 4320 & 873 \\ \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) & & & & \\ \hline Events passing central cuts & 642 & 23862 & 14351 & 472 & 78 \\ \hline \(\mathrm{\overline{t}}\) An efficiency of 90\% is assumed for lepton identification & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: H \(\to\mathrm{WW}\to\ell\nu\mathrm{jj}\) signal and backgrounds : central cutsTable 8 shows the expected efficiencies for a veto cut on additional jets in the central region, as a function of the jet-pt threshold, for the Higgs signal with and without pile-up, and for the and \(\PW+\) jet backgrounds (with pile-up included). The potential rejection of the background is quite spectacular, a factor \(\sim 10\) for a veto threshold of 50 GeV and an efficiency of - 77% for the Higgs signal. Such a cut applied to the rates shown in Table 6 would increase the signal significance from 3.3 to 5.1, but the uncertainty on this improvement due to pile-up effects and insufficiently accurate knowledge of the detector performance is quite large and should be studied further.

The uncertainties on the pile-up effects are illustrated in Figs. 16 and 17, which show the probability to find a central jet from pile-up (40 minimum bias events) as a function of the jet-pt threshold, for cell \(\ET\)-thresholds of 1 and 3 GeV. Figs. 16 and 17 show these probabilities for three cases :

* Two-jet events as generated with the PYTHIA defaults (black squares). The probability for observing a jet from hard-scattering may be defined as \(\Pj=\Nm_{\mathrm{mb}}\sigmaj/\sigma\m_{\mathrm{mb}}\), where \(\Nm_{\mathrm{mb}}=40\) is the average number of minimum bias events used for calorimeter pile-up studies and \(\sigma\m_{\mathrm{mb}}\) is the minimum-bias cross-section. However, we note that [5] : \(\Nm_{\mathrm{mb}}=\L\cdot\sigma\m_{\mathrm{mb}}\cdot\Delta t\cdot\n\),where L is the luminosity (L = 1.7 10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)), \(\Delta\)t is the bunch spacing (\(\Delta\)t = 15 ns) and n is the number of bunch crossings over which the pile-up should be computed (n = 2). We can therefore compute

\[\rm P_{j}=n\,L\,\Delta t\,\sigma_{j},\]

indicating that the dominant uncertainty on \(\rm P_{j}\) arises from the theoretical uncertainty on the inclusive jet cross-section. \(\rm P_{j}\) is of order 1 for \(\sigma_{j}\sim 1\) mb, i.e. for \(\rm p_{T}^{j}\sim 15\) GeV, showing that the curves in Figs. 16 and 17 should not be taken seriously for \(\rm p_{T}^{j}\leq 20\) GeV.
* Minimum bias events, as used in the present simulation, which yield a charged particle multiplicity of \(\sim 4.5\) per unit rapidity, which is too low (black circles).
* "Minimum bias" events generated using \(\rm p_{T}^{hard}>5\) GeV, which yield a charged particle multiplicity of \(\sim 5.5\) per unit rapidity (black triangles).

All the probabilities in Figs. 16 and 17 are normalised to a total minimum bias cross-section of 60 mb. The differences between them arise therefore only from the energy deposited by pile-up in the cone used to collect the jet energy, which thereby increases the energy scale. For example, Fig. 16 shows that this increase is \(\sim 10\) GeV for the standard minimum bias used, and amounts to \(\sim 20\) GeV for a boosted minimum bias model. Using this boosted minimum bias model to estimate the efficiency of a jet veto cut of 50 GeV would reduce the efficiency for the Higgs signal, quoted in Table 8, from 77% to \(\sim 70\%\). Such uncertainties may be greatly reduced by increasing the cell \(\rm E_{T}\)-threshold to 3 GeV, as shown in Fig. 17.

### Jet tagging

In this section, we study in detail the impact of jet tagging [6] on the signal and background rates, and on the forward calorimeter performance.

Tag jets were searched for separately in the forward (\(2<\eta<5\)) and backward (-5 \(<\eta<\) -2) regions. Jet candidates were retained if their transverse energy, collected in a cone of size \(\Delta\)R = 0.5, exceeds 15 GeV. Cell transverse energy thresholds of 1 and 3 GeV were applied to study the impact of pile-up. The forward calorimeter granularity was taken to be 0.1 \(\times\) 0.1 in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) and it's energy resolution was found to have almost no impact on the performance (it was usually set to be the same as that of the central calorimeter). The tag jet (if any) was defined as the jet with highest energy in each of the two regions.

Finally we checked that the effect of pile-up on the accuracy of the tag jet reconstruction for the Higgs signal is negligible. Figures 23 and 24 demonstrate this by comparing the distributions of the difference between the measured and true transverse momentum and azimuthal angle for tag jets from Higgs events in the absence and presence of pile-up.

#### 3.2.2 Impact of forward calorimeter performance on jet tagging

Figures 25 and 26 show the same distributions for two different calorimeter resolutions and a granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\) :

* the central calorimeter resolution used (10%/\(\rm\backslash E\oplus 1\) for electromagnetic particles and 50%/\(\rm\backslash E\oplus 3\%\) for hadronic particles) in the full histogram
* the preliminary measured forward calorimeter prototype resolution [7] (25%/\(\rm\backslash E\oplus 14\%\) for electromagnetic particles and 100%/\(\rm\backslash E\oplus 7\%\) for hadronic particles) in the dashed histogram.

Clearly a coarse energy resolution is sufficient to reconstruct the tag jet transverse energy with a resolution of \(\sim 1\%\).

Figures 27 and 28 demonstrate that a coarse granularity is not sufficient to achieve a good tag jet reconstruction. In particular a granularity coarser than \(0.2\times 0.2\) in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) seriously compromises the accuracy of the measurement of the Higgs transverse momentum through the tag jets.

Finally the impact of edge effects in the forward calorimeter was also evaluated :

* if the coverage is reduced from \(2<\rm\eta|<5\) to a more realistic value of \(2<\rm\eta|<4.5\) for energy measurements, the resulting loss in signal efficiency for \(\rm E_{j}>600\) GeV is 11% (resp. 24%) for \(\rm p_{T}^{j}>25\) GeV and \(\rm E_{T}^{cell}>3\) GeV (resp. \(\rm p_{T}^{j}>15\) GeV and \(\rm E_{T}^{cell}>1\) GeV)
* we also conservatively estimated the effect of the endcap/forward crack by ignoring all particle energies deposited over \(2.9<\rm\eta|<3.0\). The resulting loss in signal efficiency for \(\rm E_{j}>600\) GeV is 5% (resp. 6%) for \(\rm p_{T}^{j}>25\) GeV and \(\rm E_{T}^{cell}>3\) GeV (resp. \(\rm p_{T}^{j}>15\) GeV and \(\rm E_{T}^{cell}>1\) GeV).

In conclusion, we do not expect any major deterioration in tag jet reconstruction due to limitations in the combined endcap/forward calorimeter performance, provided the forward calorimeter granularity can be better than \(0.2\times 0.2\) in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\).

### Effect of jet tagging on signal and backgrounds

We are now in a position to apply jet tagging cuts to the Higgs signal and to the various backgrounds. The optimum cuts were found to be \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{j}}\) > 25 (for \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{j}}\) > 1 or 3 ) and \(\mathrm{E_{j}}\) > 600. Figures 29,30,31 show the distributions of \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{j}}\), \(\mathrm{E_{max}}\) and \(\mathrm{E_{min}}\) for the Higgs signal (solid histogram), the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background (dashed histogram) and the pile-up tag jets (dotted histogram). A cut on \(\mathrm{E_{max}}\) (larger of the two possible tag jet energies) corresponds to a simple tag, and a cut on \(\mathrm{E_{min}}\) (smaller of the two possible tag jet energies) corresponds to a double tag.

Tables 11 to 14 show the improvement in S/N expected, for the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\to\ell\nu\mathrm{jj}\) signal above the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) and \(\mathrm{W}+\mathrm{jet}\) backgrounds, after single and double tag cuts for different \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{j}}\) and \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{j}}\) thresholds. The pile-up column displays separately the total amount of background due to pile-up, but the effect of pile-up is included in the proper way in each background column. As an example, Table 13 shows that the original S/N\(\mathrm{B}\) \(\sim\) 3.3 after central cuts can be improved to \(\sim\) 5.6 with a double tag jet requirement. The probability of a double tag for the signal is \((17.6\pm 1.5)\)% for this particular set of thresholds, and the overall background is doubly tagged in only 1.08% of the cases, which can be separated into :

- 0.64% of true double tags

- 0.39% of true single tag + single pile-up tag

- 0.05% of double pile-up tags.

In addition we note that the double-tag probability is about twice as large for \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events (produced dominantly through gg fusion) as for \(\mathrm{W}+\mathrm{jet}\) events, a result in qualitative agreement with previous studies [1].

In a similar way, Tables 15 to 18 show the same results for the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{ZZ}\to\ell\ell\mathrm{jj}\) channel, which also improves from a S/N ratio of 1.7 after central cuts, to \(\sim\) 3.9 after double-tag jet cuts (Table 17). The small rates (18 signal events over a background of 22 events) do not however compensate for the absence of the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background, which dominates in the case of \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\to\ell\ell\mathrm{jj}\).

As discussed at the beginning of this section, the WW, WZ and ZZ continuum backgrounds are negligible with respect to the QCD backgrounds. Tables 19 to 22 nevertheless display the effect of jet tagging cuts on these backgrounds for the sake of completeness.

## IV Conclusions

Figures 32 (33) show the expected transverse mass (m\({}_{\rm T}^{\rm 2\nu jj}\)) distribution for the H \(\rightarrow\) WW \(\rightarrow\)\(\ell\,\)vjj signal and the remaining background after jet tagging cuts, for 10\({}^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (3 10\({}^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)). The hard kinematic cuts used do not allow us to see the background rise for low values of m\({}_{\rm T}^{\rm 2\nu jj}\). This is better seen in Figs. 34 (35) which show the expected reconstructed mass, m\({}_{\rm Z\ell jj}\), for the H \(\rightarrow\) ZZ \(\rightarrow\)\(\ell\,\)jj signal and the residual Z + jet background.

The combination of these two signals and a careful study of central jet multiplicities may allow us to detect a Higgs signal in this mass range for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\) pb-1. The lack of knowledge of the background shapes and the uncertainties on the exact level of pile-up to be expected may well result in the need for several years of running before reaching a firm conclusion about boson pair production at high masses.

Future studies along the lines of this note should concentrate on checking the PYTHIA estimates for W, Z + multijet production in this kinematic region with matrix element Monte-Carlo programmes, in studying better the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\)  and W + jet background shapes at lower masses and in understanding whether lower Higgs masses may be detected in these channels.
